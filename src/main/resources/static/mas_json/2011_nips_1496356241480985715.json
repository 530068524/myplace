We show through behavioral studies that humans employ three distinct teaching strategies, one of which is consistent with the curriculum learning principle, and propose a novel theoretical framework as a potential explanation for this strategy. This framework, which assumes a teaching goal of minimizing the learner's expected generalization error at each iteration, extends the standard teaching dimension model and offers a theoretical justification for curriculum learning.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Faisal Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Faisal", "Xiaojin (Jerry) Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaojin_=Jerry=", "Bilge Mutlu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mutlu:Bilge"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
