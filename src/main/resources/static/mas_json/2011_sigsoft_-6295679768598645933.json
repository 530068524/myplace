{"title": "Synoptic: studying logged behavior with inferred models.", "fields": ["inference", "theoretical computer science", "logging", "finite state machine", "workflow"], "abstract": "Logging is a powerful method for capturing program activity and state during an execution. However, log inspection remains a tedious activity, with developers often piecing together what went on from multiple log lines and across many files. This paper describes Synoptic, a tool that takes logs as input and outputs a finite state machine that models the process generating the logs. The paper overviews the model inference algorithms. Then, it describes the Synoptic tool, which is designed to support a rich log exploration workflow.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Ivan Beschastnikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beschastnikh:Ivan", "Jenny Abrahamson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abrahamson:Jenny", "Yuriy Brun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brun:Yuriy", "Michael D.
