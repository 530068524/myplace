Its importance is especially pronounced when performing online temporal difference (TD) learning with function approximation. Several methods have been developed to adapt the step-size online. These range from straightforward back-off strategies to adaptive algorithms based on gradient descent. We derive an adaptive upper bound on the step-size parameter to guarantee that online TD learning with linear function approximation will not diverge. We then empirically evaluate algorithms using this upper bound as a heuristic for adapting the stepsize parameter online. We compare performance with related work including HL(\u03bb) and Autostep. Our results show that this adaptive upper bound heuristic out-performs all existing methods without requiring any meta-parameters. This effectively eliminates the need to tune the learning rate of temporal difference learning with linear function approximation.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["William Dabney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dabney:William", "Andrew G.
