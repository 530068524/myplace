Among other things, we deduce that feedforward ReLU neural networks with one hidden layer can be characterized by zonotopes, which serve as building blocks for deeper networks; we relate decision boundaries of such neural networks to tropical hypersurfaces, a major object of study in tropical geometry; and we prove that linear regions of such neural networks correspond to vertices of polytopes associated with tropical rational functions. An insight from our tropical formulation is that a deeper network is exponentially more expressive than a shallow network.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["Liwen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Liwen", "Gregory Naitzat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naitzat:Gregory", "Lek-Heng Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Lek=Heng"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
