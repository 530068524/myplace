In this paper, by bridging consumer behavior with perceived stimuli on social networks, we present a computational framework, termed Consumer Impulsivity Model ( CIM ), for exploring a consumer's impulsivity in both offline and online context: consumption-related location visit indicating consumption patterns in the physical realm, and online shopping behavior indicating economic activities on the Internet. To demonstrate the effectiveness of  CIM , we conduct extensive experiments, with a large dataset we have collected from thousands of consumers. The results show that 1) for 103 subjects, the inferred consumer impulsivity has a positive Pearson correlation with survey results in the situation of product and product category, respectively. 2) females inferred impulsivity is higher than males on average in the situation of product and product category, respectively. Age has a negative Pearson correlation with inferred impulsivity in the situation of POI, POI category and product category, respectively. 3) for next behavior prediction, our model defeats several presented baselines. These results suggest that our framework CIM offers a powerful paradigm for 1) presenting an effective measurement for consumer impulsivity. 2) uncovering the correlation between consumer impulsivity and demographic factors and 3) revealing that the introduction of impulsivity is effective in predicting consumer behavior.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Queensland", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Fuzheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Fuzheng", "Nicholas Jing Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Nicholas_Jing", "Kai Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Kai", "Defu Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Defu", "Xing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Xing", "Yong Rui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rui:Yong"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
