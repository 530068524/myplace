The 2\u00d72 experiment crossed two depth judgment tasks, perceptual matching and blind reaching, with two different environments, a real-world environment and an augmented reality environment. We designed a task that used a direct reaching gesture at constant percentages of each participant's maximum reach; our task was inspired by previous work by Tresilian and Mon-Williams [6] that found very accurate blind reaching results in a real-world environment.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Mississippi State University", "Mississippi State University", "Mississippi State University", "Ames Research Center"], "authors": ["Gurjot Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Gurjot", "J.
