NWAs can express some context-free properties, such as parenthesis matching, yet retain all the desirable closure characteristics of finite-state automata.\n\nThis paper describes OpenNWA, a C++ library for working with NWAs. The library provides the expected automata-theoretic operations, such as intersection, determinization, and complementation. It is packaged with WALi--the Weighted Automaton Library--and interoperates closely with the weighted pushdown system portions of WALi.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Evan Driscoll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Driscoll:Evan", "Aditya V.
