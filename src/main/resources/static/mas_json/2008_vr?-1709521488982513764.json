Building acceptance is the process of comparing as-planned documentation with the factory that was actually built. A self-supported mobile AR device, the AR-planar, is used to facilitate this comparison by overlaying 3D models on top of a video image. The suitability of this approach is assessed using an expert heuristic in a real factory, and furthermore the usability of the AR-planar in comparison to other AR systems was examined in a complementary user study.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "authors": ["Ralph Schoenfelder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schoenfelder:Ralph", "Dieter Schmalstieg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmalstieg:Dieter"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
