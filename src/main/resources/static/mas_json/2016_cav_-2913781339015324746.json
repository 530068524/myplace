{"title": "Structural Synthesis for GXW Specifications.", "fields": ["programmable logic controller", "linear temporal logic", "disjunctive normal form", "controller", "operator"], "abstract": "We define the \\(\\textsf {\\small {GXW}} \\) fragment of linear temporal logic (LTL) as the basis for synthesizing embedded control software for safety-critical applications. Since \\(\\textsf {\\small {GXW}} \\) includes the use of a weak-until operator we are able to specify a number of diverse programmable logic control (PLC) problems, which we have compiled from industrial training sets. For \\(\\textsf {\\small {GXW}} \\) controller specifications, we develop a novel approach for synthesizing a set of synchronously communicating actor-based controllers. This synthesis algorithm proceeds by means of recursing over the structure of \\(\\textsf {\\small {GXW}} \\) specifications, and generates a set of dedicated and synchronously communicating sub-controllers according to the formula structure. In a subsequent step, 2QBF constraint solving identifies and tries to resolve potential conflicts between individual \\(\\textsf {\\small {GXW}} \\) specifications. This structural approach to \\(\\textsf {\\small {GXW}} \\) synthesis supports traceability between requirements and the generated control code as mandated by certification regimes for safety-critical software. Our experimental results suggest that GXW synthesis scales well to industrial-sized control synthesis problems with 20 input and output ports and beyond.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Chih-Hong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Chih=Hong", "Yassine Hamza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamza:Yassine", "Harald Ruess.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruess:Harald"], "pages": 23}
