{"title": "Influence of Vertical Result in Web Search Examination.", "fields": ["federated search", "attraction", "search analytics", "ranking", "organic search"], "abstract": "Research in how users examine results on search engine result pages (SERPs) helps improve result ranking, advertisement placement, performance evaluation and search UI design. Although examination behavior on organic search results (also known as \"ten blue links\") has been well studied in existing works, there lacks a thorough investigation on how users examine SERPs with verticals. Considering the fact that a large fraction of SERPs are served with one or more verticals in the practical Web search scenario, it is of vital importance to understand the influence of vertical results on search examination behaviors. In this paper, we focus on five popular vertical types and try to study their influences on users' examination processes in both cases when they are relevant or irrelevant to the search queries. With examination behavior data collected with an eye-tracking device, we show the existence of vertical-aware user behavior effects including vertical attraction effect, examination cut-off effect in the presence of a relevant vertical, and examination spill-over effect in the presence of an irrelevant vertical. Furthermore, we are also among the first to systematically investigate the internal examination behavior within the vertical results. We believe that this work will promote our understanding of user interactions with federated search engines and bring benefit to the construction of search performance evaluations.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Yahoo!", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Zeyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zeyang", "Yiqun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yiqun", "Ke Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ke", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Min", "Shaoping Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shaoping"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
