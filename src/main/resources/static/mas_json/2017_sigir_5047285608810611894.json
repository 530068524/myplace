{"title": "Cross-Language Question Re-Ranking.", "fields": ["ranking", "arabic", "tree kernel", "performance gap", "machine translation"], "abstract": "We study how to find relevant questions in community forums when the language of the new questions is different from that of the existing questions in the forum. In particular, we explore the Arabic-English language pair. We compare a kernel-based system with a feed-forward neural network in a scenario where a large parallel corpus is available for training a machine translation system, bilingual dictionaries, and cross-language word embeddings. We observe that both approaches degrade the performance of the system when working on the translated text, especially the kernel-based system, which depends heavily on a syntactic kernel. We address this issue using a cross-language tree kernel, which compares the original Arabic tree to the English trees of the related questions. We show that this kernel almost closes the performance gap with respect to the monolingual system. On the neural network side, we use the parallel corpus to train cross-language embeddings, which we then use to represent the Arabic input and the English related questions in the same space. The results also improve to close to those of the monolingual neural network. Overall, the kernel system shows a better performance compared to the neural network in all cases.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Giovanni Da San Martino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martino:Giovanni_Da_San", "Salvatore Romeo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romeo:Salvatore", "Alberto Barr\u00f3n-Cede\u00f1o.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barr=oacute=n=Cede=ntilde=o:Alberto", "Shafiq R.
