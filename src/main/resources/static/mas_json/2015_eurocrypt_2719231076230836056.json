The exclusive-or (XOR) combiner \\(H_1(M) \\oplus H_2(M)\\) is one of the two most classical combiners, together with the concatenation combiner \\(H_1(M) \\Vert H_2(M)\\). While the security of the concatenation of two hash functions is well understood since Joux\u2019s seminal work on multicollisions, the security of the sum of two hash functions has been much less studied. The XOR combiner is well known as a good PRF and MAC combiner, and is used in practice in TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1. In a hash function setting, Hoch and Shamir have shown that if the compression functions are modeled as random oracles, or even weak random oracles (i.e. they can easily be inverted \u2013 in particular \\(H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\) offer no security), \\(H_1 \\oplus H_2\\) is indifferentiable from a random oracle up to the birthday bound.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ga\u00ebtan Leurent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leurent:Ga=euml=tan", "Lei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0031:Lei"], "pages": 23}
