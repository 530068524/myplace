{"title": "Label Embedding Trees for Large Multi-Class Tasks.", "fields": ["computer science", "artificial intelligence", "embedding", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Multi-class classification becomes challenging at test time when the number of classes is very large and testing against every possible class can become computationally infeasible. This problem can be alleviated by imposing (or learning) a structure over the set of classes. We propose an algorithm for learning a tree-structure of classifiers which, by optimizing the overall tree loss, provides superior accuracy to existing tree labeling methods. We also propose a method that learns to embed labels in a low dimensional space that is faster than non-embedding approaches and has superior accuracy to existing embedding approaches. Finally we combine the two ideas resulting in the label embedding tree that outperforms alternative methods including One-vs-Rest while being orders of magnitude faster.", "citation": "Citations (301)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Samy Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Samy", "Jason Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Jason", "David Grangier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grangier:David"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
