To scale such applications to a large number of users without high infrastructure cost, we apply peer-to-peer techniques to mesh streaming. We consider two issues: how to partition a progressive mesh into chunks and how to lookup the provider of a chunk. For the latter issue, we investigated into two solutions, which trade off server overhead and response time. The first uses a simple centralized lookup service, while the second organizes peers into groups according to the hierarchical structure of the progressive meshes to take advantage of access pattern. Simulation results show that our proposed systems are robust under high churn rate, reduce the server overhead by more than 90%, keep control overhead below 10%, and achieve low average response time.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Wei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wei", "Dan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Dan", "Wei Tsang Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Wei_Tsang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
