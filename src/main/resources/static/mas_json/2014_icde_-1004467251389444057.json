Nowadays, data architects are faced with a large variety of transformation tasks, and there is huge number of different approaches and systems that were conceived to solve them. As a consequence, it is very important to be able to evaluate such alternative solutions, in order to pick up the right ones for the problem at hand. To do this, we introduce IQ-Meter, the first comprehensive tool for the evaluation of data-transformation systems. IQ-Meter can be used to benchmark, test, and even learn the best usage of data-transformation tools. It builds on a number of novel algorithms to measure the quality of outputs and the human effort required by a given system, and ultimately measures \u201chow much intelligence\u201d the system brings to the solution of a data-translation task.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Qatar Airways", "Universit\u00e0 dell ...
