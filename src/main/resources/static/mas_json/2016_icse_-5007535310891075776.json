{"title": "Comparing white-box and black-box test prioritization.", "fields": ["white box", "prioritization", "black box testing", "test set", "regression testing"], "abstract": "Although white-box regression test prioritization has been well-studied, the more recently introduced black-box prioritization approaches have neither been compared against each other nor against more well-established white-box techniques. We present a comprehensive experimental comparison of several test prioritization techniques, including well-established white-box strategies and more recently introduced black-box approaches. We found that Combinatorial Interaction Testing and diversity-based techniques (Input Model Diversity and Input Test Set Diameter) perform best among the black-box approaches. Perhaps surprisingly, we found little difference between black-box and white-box performance (at most 4% fault detection rate difference). We also found the overlap between black- and white-box faults to be high: the first 10% of the prioritized test suites already agree on at least 60% of the faults found. These are positive findings for practicing regression testers who may not have source code available, thereby making white-box techniques inapplicable. We also found evidence that both black-box and white-box prioritization remain robust over multiple system releases.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University College London", "University College London", "University of Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Christopher Henard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henard:Christopher", "Mike Papadakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadakis:Mike", "Mark Harman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harman:Mark", "Yue Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yue", "Yves Le Traon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traon:Yves_Le"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
