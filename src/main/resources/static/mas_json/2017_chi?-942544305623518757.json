But if vibrotactile actuation is tightly coupled to users' actions, it can be used to create much richer haptic experiences. It is not well understood, however, how this coupling should be done or which vibrotactile parameters create which experiences. To investigate how actuation parameters relate to haptic experiences, we built a physical slider with minimal native friction, a vibrotactile actuator and an integrated position sensor. By vibrating the slider as it is moved, we create an experience of texture between the sliding element and its track. We conducted a magnitude estimation experiment to map how granularity, amplitude and timbre relate to the experiences of roughness, adhesiveness, sharpness and bumpiness. We found that amplitude influences the strength of the perceived texture, while variations in granularity and timbre create distinct experiences. Our study underlines the importance of action in haptic perception and suggests strategies for deploying such tightly coupled feedback in everyday devices.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Paul Strohmeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strohmeier:Paul", "Kasper Hornb\u00e6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hornb=aelig=k:Kasper"], "pages": 12}
