However, identifying the best-throughput MU-MIMO groups in commodity 802.11ac networks poses three major challenges:  a ) Commodity 802.11ac users do not provide  full CSI  feedback, which has been widely used for MU-MIMO grouping.  b ) Heterogeneous channel bandwidth users limit grouping opportunities.  c ) Limited-resource on APs cannot support computationally and memory expensive operations, required by existing algorithms. Hence, state-of-the-art designs are either not portable in 802.11ac APs, or perform poorly, as shown by our testbed experiments. In this paper, we design and implement  MUSE , a lightweight user grouping algorithm, which addresses the above challenges. Our experiments with commodity 802.11ac testbeds show  MUSE  can achieve high throughput gains over existing designs.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Sanjib Sur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sur:Sanjib", "Ioannis Pefkianakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pefkianakis:Ioannis", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu", "Kyu-Han Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kyu=Han"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
