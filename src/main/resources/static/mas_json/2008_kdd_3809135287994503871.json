{"title": "Effective label acquisition for collective classification.", "fields": ["approximate inference", "viral marketing", "small number", "labeled data", "exploit"], "abstract": "Information diffusion, viral marketing, and collective classification all attempt to model and exploit the relationships in a network to make inferences about the labels of nodes. A variety of techniques have been introduced and methods that combine attribute information and neighboring label information have been shown to be effective for collective labeling of the nodes in a network. However, in part because of the correlation between node labels that the techniques exploit, it is easy to find cases in which, once a misclassification is made, incorrect information propagates throughout the network. This problem can be mitigated if the system is allowed to judiciously acquire the labels for a small number of nodes. Unfortunately, under relatively general assumptions, determining the optimal set of labels to acquire is intractable. Here we propose an acquisition method that learns the cases when a given collective classification algorithm makes mistakes, and suggests acquisitions to correct those mistakes. We empirically show on both real and synthetic datasets that this method significantly outperforms a greedy approximate inference approach, a viral marketing approach, and approaches based on network structural measures such as node degree and network clustering. In addition to significantly improving accuracy with just a small amount of labeled data, our method is tractable on large networks.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Mustafa Bilgic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bilgic_0001:Mustafa", "Lise Getoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Getoor:Lise"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
