This algorithm handles global structures, such as clause and coordination, better than shift-reduce or other bottom-up algorithms. Experiments on the English Penn Treebank data and the Chinese CoNLL-06 data show that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable results with other data-driven dependency parsing algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "National Instit ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Katsuhiko Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi:Katsuhiko", "Taro Watanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watanabe:Taro", "Masayuki Asahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asahara:Masayuki", "Yuji Matsumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsumoto_0001:Yuji"], "pages": 9}
