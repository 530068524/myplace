{"title": "Challenges of using Personal Data to Drive Personalised Electronic Programme Guides.", "fields": ["computer science", "focus group", "data collection", "multimedia", "personalization"], "abstract": "Media researchers are adopting personalisation in diverse ways to deliver increasingly context-sensitive and customised media experiences. This paper explores user attitudes towards a personalised Electronic Programme Guide which tailors media recommendations based on users' personal data. We used scenario based exploration enabled by the use of probes to convey the functionalities of data-driven personalised EPGs and to facilitate user discussions around its potential use. Users preferred personalised EPGs over current popular EPGs but expressed a significant lack of trust in the personal data collection that drives personalisation. Users appreciated the functionalities afforded by personalisation of media but were apprehensive about the implications of the personal data being collected about them, particularly in the context of their homes. This calls for the need to design future personalised media experiences that help enhance trust in these socio-technical settings.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Salford"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Neelima Sailaja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sailaja:Neelima", "Andy Crabtree.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crabtree:Andy", "Phil Stenton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stenton:Phil"], "pages": 6}
