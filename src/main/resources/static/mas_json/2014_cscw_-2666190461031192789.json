Many systems use competitive elements, for example point scoring and leaderboards, to achieve these ends. However, while competition may motivate some people, it can have a neutral or demotivating effect on others. In this paper we explore theories of personal and social norms and investigate normification as an alternative approach to engagement, to be used alongside or instead of competitive strategies. We provide a systematic review of existing crowdsourcing and citizen science literature and categorise the ways that theories of norms have been incorporated to date. We then present qualitative interview data from a pro-environmental crowdsourcing study, Close the Door, which reveals normalising attitudes in certain participants. We assess how this links with competitive behaviour and participant performance. Based on our findings and analysis of norm theories, we consider the implications for designers wishing to use normification as an engagement strategy in crowdsourcing and citizen science systems.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol"], "authors": ["Chris Preist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Preist:Chris", "Elaine Massung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massung:Elaine", "David Coyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coyle:David"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
