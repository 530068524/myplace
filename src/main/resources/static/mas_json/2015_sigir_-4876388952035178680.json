{"title": "Adapted B-CUBED Metrics to Unbalanced Datasets.", "fields": ["data mining", "cluster analysis", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "B-CUBED metrics have recently been adopted in the evaluation of clustering results as well as in many other related tasks. However, this family of metrics is not well adapted when datasets are unbalanced. This issue is extremely frequent in Web results, where classes are distributed following a strong unbalanced pattern. In this paper, we present a modified version of B-CUBED metrics to overcome this situation. Results in toy and real datasets indicate that the proposed adaptation correctly considers the particularities of unbalanced cases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Caen Lower Normandy", "University of Caen Lower Normandy"], "authors": ["Jose G.
