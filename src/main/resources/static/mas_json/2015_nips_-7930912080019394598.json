In particular, for a given function x \u2192 f (x) we consider optimization when one is given access to absolute error oracles that return values in [f (x) - \u220a, f (x) + \u220a] or relative error oracles that return value in [(1 - \u220a)f (x), (1 + \u220a)f (x)], for some \u220a > 0. We show stark information theoretic impossibility results for minimizing convex functions and maximizing concave functions over polytopes in this model.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Harvard University", "IBM"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yaron Singer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singer:Yaron", "Jan Vondr\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vondr=aacute=k:Jan"], "pages": 9}
