Whereas methods and techniques to find affected elements have been extensively researched in regression testing, how to generate new test cases to cover these elements cost-effectively has rarely been studied. It is known that generating test cases is very expensive, so we want to focus on this second step. We believe that reusing existing test cases will help us achieve this task. This research intends to provide a framework for test suite augmentation techniques that will reuse existing test cases to automatically generate new test cases to cover as many affected elements as possible cost-effectively.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln"], "authors": ["Zhihong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zhihong"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
