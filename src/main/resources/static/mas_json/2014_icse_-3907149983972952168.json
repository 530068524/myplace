Build teams manage this process and ensure builds are produced reliably and efficiently. This paper presents an exploration into the nature of build teams--how they form, work, and relate to other teams--through three multi-method studies conducted at Microsoft. We also consider build team effectiveness and find that many challenges are social, not technical: role ambiguity, knowledge sharing, communication, trust, and conflict. Our findings validate theories from group dynamics and organization science, and using a cross-discipline approach, we apply learnings from these fields to inform the design of engineering tools and practices to improve build team effectiveness", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Shaun Phillips.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phillips:Shaun", "Thomas Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann_0001:Thomas", "Christian Bird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bird:Christian"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
