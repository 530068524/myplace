However, there does not exist a standard automatic evaluation metric for open-domain dialog systems; researchers usually resort to human annotation for model evaluation, which is time- and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose RUBER, a Referenced metric and Unreferenced metric Blended Evaluation Routine, which evaluates a reply by taking into consideration both a groundtruth reply and a query (previous user-issued utterance). Our metric is learnable, but its training does not require labels of human satisfaction. Hence, RUBER is flexible and extensible to different datasets and languages. Experiments on both retrieval and generative dialog systems show that RUBER has a high correlation with human annotation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Peking University", "University of Waterloo", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Chongyang Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Chongyang", "Lili Mou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mou:Lili", "Dongyan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Dongyan", "Rui Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Rui"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
