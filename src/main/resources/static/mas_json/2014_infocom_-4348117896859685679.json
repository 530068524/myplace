While this problem has already been studied intensively for simplistic single-hop or unit disk graph models, we make a leap forward and study MAC protocols for the SINR interference model (a.k.a. the physical model). We make two contributions. First, we introduce a new adver- sarial SINR model which captures a wide range of interference phenomena. Concretely, we consider a powerful, adaptive adver- sary which can jam nodes at arbitrary times and which is only limited by some energy budget. The second contribution of this paper is a distributed MAC protocol which provably achieves a constant competitive throughput in this environment: we show that, with high probability, the protocol ensures that a constant fraction of the non-blocked time periods is used for successful transmissions. Our results also highlight an inherent difference between the SINR model and unit disk graph models.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Paderborn", "Arizona State University", "University of Paderborn", "Telekom Innovation Laboratories", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Adrian Ogierman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogierman:Adrian", "Andr\u00e9a W.
