In the streets, under water, in space, in your homes, schools 1  and offices. Also in your pockets and maybe on your wrists. Chances are, you are reading this on one. How many of them, however, do you feel are seamless part of the environment you want to be in? To how many do you attend at once? And how about at night?

And maybe forgot to switch it back on in the morning?", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Newcastle University"], "authors": ["Jan Kucera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kucera:Jan"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
