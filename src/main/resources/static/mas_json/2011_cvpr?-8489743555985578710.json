We propose a novel technique for finding point-wise scaling parameters based on Ripley's K-function [12] which enables data clustering at different density scales within the same dataset. Additionally, we provide a method for enhancing the spatial similarity matrix by including a density metric between neighborhoods. We show how our proposed methods for building similarity matrices can improve the results attained by traditional approaches for several well known clustering algorithms on a variety of datasets.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kevin Streib.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Streib:Kevin", "James W.
