{"title": "Pipelined Query Processing in Coprocessor Environments.", "fields": ["coprocessor", "online analytical processing", "execution model", "massively parallel", "compiler"], "abstract": "Query processing on GPU-style coprocessors is severely limited by the movement of data. With teraflops of compute throughput in one device, even high-bandwidth memory cannot provision enough data for a reasonable utilization.   Query compilation is a proven technique to improve memory efficiency. However, its inherent tuple-at-a-time processing style does not suit the massively parallel execution model of GPU-style coprocessors. This compromises the improvements in efficiency offered by query compilation. In this paper, we show how query compilation and GPU-style parallelism can be made to play in unison nevertheless. We describe a compiler strategy that merges multiple operations into a single GPU kernel, thereby significantly reducing bandwidth demand. Compared to operator-at-a-time, we show reductions of memory access volumes by factors of up to 7.5x resulting in shorter kernel execution times by factors of up to 9.5x.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Technical University of Dortmund", "Technical University of Dortmund", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Dortmund", "DFKI GmbH, Berlin, Germany"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Henning Funke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Funke:Henning", "Sebastian Bre\u00df.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bre=szlig=:Sebastian", "Stefan Noll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noll:Stefan", "Volker Markl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markl:Volker", "Jens Teubner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teubner:Jens"], "pages": 16}
