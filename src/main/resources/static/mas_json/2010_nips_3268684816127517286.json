In the setting of online convex optimization and repeated games, the algorithm yields low regret and presents a novel efficient method for implementing mixture forecasting strategies.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Hariharan Narayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanan:Hariharan", "Alexander Rakhlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rakhlin:Alexander"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
