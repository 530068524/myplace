{"title": "Achieving utility-delay-reliability tradeoff in stochastic network optimization with finite buffers.", "fields": ["network packet", "open problem", "maximization", "queue", "distributed algorithm"], "abstract": "One practical open problem is the development of a distributed algorithm that achieves near-optimal utility using only a finite (and small) buffer size for queues in a stochastic network. This paper studies utility maximization (or cost minimization) in a finite-buffer regime and considers the corresponding delay and reliability (or rate of packet drops) tradeoff. A floating-queue algorithm allows the stochastic network optimization framework to be implemented with finite buffers at the cost of packet drops. Further, the buffer size requirement is significantly smaller than previous works in this area. With a finite buffer size of B packets, the proposed algorithm achieves within O(e \u2212B ) of the optimal utility while maintaining average per-hop delay of O(B) and an average per-hop drop rate of O(e \u2212B ) in steady state. From an implementation perspective, the floating-queue algorithm requires little modification of the well-known DriftPlus-Penalty policy (including MaxWeight and Backpressure policies). As a result, the floating-queue algorithm inherits the distributed and low complexity nature of these policies.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Sucha Supittayapornpong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Supittayapornpong:Sucha", "Michael J.
