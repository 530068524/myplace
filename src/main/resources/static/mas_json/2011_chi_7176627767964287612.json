{"title": "Automics: souvenir generating photoware for theme parks.", "fields": ["user experience design", "digital image", "tourism", "annotation", "mobile device"], "abstract": "Automics is a photo-souvenir service which utilises mobile devices to support the capture, sharing and annotation of digital images amongst groups of visitors to theme parks. The prototype service mixes individual and group photo-capture with existing in-park, on-ride photo services, to allow users to create printed photo-stories. Herein we discuss initial fieldwork in theme parks that grounded the design of Automics, our development of the service prototype, and its real-world evaluation with theme park visitors. We relate our findings on user experience of the service to a literature on mobile photoware, finding implications for the design of souvenir services.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Lincoln", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Abigail Durrant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durrant:Abigail", "Duncan Rowland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rowland:Duncan", "David S.
