The approach to achieve this relies on an unobtrusive and wrist-worn data logger, in combination with a custom data mining tool that performs early data abstraction and dense motif discovery to collect evidence for activities. After presenting the system design, a feasibility study on weeks of continuous inertial data from 6 participants investigates both accuracy and execution speed of each of the abstraction and detection steps. Results show that our method is able to detect target activities in a large data set with a comparable precision and recall to more conventional approaches, in approximately the time it takes to download and visualize the logs from the sensor.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Eugen Berlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berlin:Eugen", "Kristof Van Laerhoven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laerhoven:Kristof_Van"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
