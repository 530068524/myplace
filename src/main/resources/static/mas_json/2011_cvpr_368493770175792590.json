Using a calibration target is not possible for many applications of hand-eye calibration. In such situations Structure-from-Motion approach of hand-eye calibration is commonly used to recover the camera poses up to scaling. The presented method takes advantage of recent results in the L \u221e -norm optimization using Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) to recover the correct scale. Further, the correctly scaled displacement of the hand-eye transformation is recovered solely from the image correspondences and robot measurements, and is guaranteed to be globally optimal with respect to the L \u221e -norm. The method is experimentally validated using both synthetic and real world datasets.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "National Institute of Informatics", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jan Heller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heller:Jan", "Michal Havlena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Havlena:Michal", "Akihiro Sugimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugimoto:Akihiro", "Tom\u00e1s Pajdla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pajdla:Tom=aacute=s"], "pages": 7}
