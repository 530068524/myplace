{"title": "Inverting HFE Systems Is Quasi-Polynomial for All Fields.", "fields": ["quasi polynomial", "finite field", "quantum computer", "hidden field equations", "quotient ring"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present and prove the first closed formula bounding the degree of regularity of an HFE system over an arbitrary finite field. Though these bounds are not necessarily optimal, they can be used to deduce 1. if D, the degree of the corresponding HFE polynomial, and q, the size of the corresponding finite field, are fixed, inverting HFE system is polynomial for all fields;", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["South China University of Technology", "South China University of Technology"], "authors": ["Jintai Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Jintai", "Timothy J.
