{"title": "A simply exponential upper bound on the maximum number of stable matchings.", "fields": ["physical constant", "open problem", "partially ordered set", "stable marriage problem", "exponential function"], "abstract": "Stable matching is a classical combinatorial problem that has been the subject of intense theoretical and empirical study since its introduction in 1962 in a seminal paper by Gale and Shapley. In this paper, we provide a new upper bound on  f ( n ), the maximum number of stable matchings that a stable matching instance with  n  men and  n  women can have. It has been a long-standing open problem to understand the asymptotic behavior of  f ( n ) as  n \u2192\u221e, first posed by Donald Knuth in the 1970s. Until now the best lower bound was approximately 2.28  n  , and the best upper bound was 2  n log n \u2212  O ( n ) . In this paper, we show that for all  n ,  f ( n ) \u2264  c   n   for some universal constant  c . This matches the lower bound up to the base of the exponent. Our proof is based on a reduction to counting the number of downsets of a family of posets that we call \u201cmixing\u201d. The latter might be of independent interest.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anna R.
