{"title": "Efficient execution of recursive programs on commodity vector hardware.", "fields": ["vectorization", "task parallelism", "speedup", "data parallelism", "simd"], "abstract": "The pursuit of computational efficiency has led to the proliferation of throughput-oriented hardware, from GPUs to increasingly wide vector units on commodity processors and accelerators. This hardware is designed to efficiently execute data-parallel computations in a vectorized manner. However, many algorithms are more naturally expressed as divide-and-conquer, recursive, task-parallel computations. In the absence of data parallelism, it seems that such algorithms are not well suited to throughput-oriented architectures. This paper presents a set of novel code transformations that expose the data parallelism latent in recursive, task-parallel programs. These transformations facilitate straightforward vectorization of task-parallel programs on commodity hardware. We also present scheduling policies that maintain high utilization of vector resources while limiting space usage. Across several task-parallel benchmarks, we demonstrate both efficient vector resource utilization and substantial speedup on chips using Intel\u2019s SSE4.2 vector units, as well as accelerators using Intel\u2019s AVX512 units.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Purdue University", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Bin Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Bin", "Youngjoon Jo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jo:Youngjoon", "Sriram Krishnamoorthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamoorthy:Sriram", "Kunal Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Kunal", "Milind Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni_0001:Milind"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
