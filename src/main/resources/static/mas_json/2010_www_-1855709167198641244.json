{"title": "Sig.ma: live views on the web of data.", "fields": ["mashup", "data web", "web standards", "social semantic web", "web modeling"], "abstract": "We demonstrate Sig.ma, both a service and an end user application to access the Web of Data as an integrated information space.   Sig.ma uses an holistic approach in which large scale semantic web indexing, logic reasoning, data aggregation heuristics, ad hoc ontology consolidation, external services and responsive user interaction all play together to create rich entity descriptions. These consolidated entity descriptions then form the base for embeddable data mashups, machine oriented services as well as data browsing services. Finally, we discuss Sig.ma's peculiar characteristics and report on lessions learned and ideas it inspires.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["National University of Ireland, Galway", "National University of Ireland, Galway", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "National University of Ireland, Galway", "National University of Ireland, Galway"], "authors": ["Giovanni Tummarello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tummarello:Giovanni", "Richard Cyganiak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cyganiak:Richard", "Michele Catasta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catasta:Michele", "Szymon Danielczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danielczyk:Szymon", "Renaud Delbru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delbru:Renaud", "Stefan Decker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Decker:Stefan"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
