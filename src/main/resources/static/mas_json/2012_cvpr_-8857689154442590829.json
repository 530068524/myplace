Unlike most previous approaches that use linear motion methods only, we online build a non-linear motion map to better explain direction changes and produce more robust motion affinities between tracklets. Moreover, based on the incremental learned entry/exit map, a multiple instance learning method is devised to produce strong appearance models for tracking; positive sample pairs are collected from different track-lets so that training samples have high diversity. Finally, using online learned moving groups, a tracklet completion process is introduced to deal with tracklets not reaching entry/exit points. We evaluate our approach on three public data sets, and show significant improvements compared with state-of-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (194)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Bo Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0008:Bo", "Ram Nevatia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nevatia:Ram"], "pages": 8}
