{"title": "IncepText: A New Inception-Text Module with Deformable PSROI Pooling for Multi-Oriented Scene Text Detection.", "fields": ["pooling", "detector", "object detection", "pattern recognition", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "Incidental scene text detection, especially for multi-oriented text regions, is one of the most challenging tasks in many computer vision applications. Different from the common object detection task, scene text often suffers from a large variance of aspect ratio, scale, and orientation. To solve this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end scene text detector IncepText from an instance-aware segmentation perspective. We design a novel Inception-Text module and introduce deformable PSROI pooling to deal with multi-oriented text detection. Extensive experiments on ICDAR2015, RCTW-17, and MSRA-TD500 datasets demonstrate our method's superiority in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Our proposed method achieves 1st place result on ICDAR2015 challenge and the state-of-the-art performance on other datasets. Moreover, we have released our implementation as an OCR product which is available for public access.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Alibaba Group", "Alibaba Group", "Alibaba Group", "Alibaba Group", "Alibaba Group"], "authors": ["Qiangpeng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Qiangpeng", "Mengli Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Mengli", "Wenmeng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Wenmeng", "Yan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yan", "Minghui Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Minghui", "Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Wei"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
