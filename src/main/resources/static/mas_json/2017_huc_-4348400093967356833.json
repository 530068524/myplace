The smart urban is favored because it improves the standard of living of the citizens and provides excellence in the community services. The services may include but not limited to health, parking, transport, water, environment, power, and so forth. The diverse and heterogeneous environment of IoT and smart urban is challenged by real-time data processing and decision-making. In this research article, we propose IoT based smart urban architecture using Big Data analytics. The proposed architecture is divided into three different tiers: (1) data acquisition and aggregation, (2) data computation and processing, and (3) decision making and application. The proposed architecture is implemented and validated on Hadoop Ecosystem using reliable and authentic datasets. The research shows that the proposed system presents valuable imminent into the community development systems to get better the existing smart urban architecture.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of Sciences and Technology", "National University of Sciences and Technology"], "authors": ["Muhammad Babar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babar:Muhammad", "Fahim Arif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arif:Fahim"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
