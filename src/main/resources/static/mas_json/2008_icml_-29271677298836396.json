The interests, formulated as an implicit query, can then be used in further searches. We formulate this task as a probabilistic model, which can be interpreted as a kind of transfer or meta-learning. The probabilistic model is demonstrated to outperform an earlier kernel-based method in a small-scale information retrieval task.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Helsinki University of Technology", "Helsinki University of Technology", "Helsinki University of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Kai Puolam\u00e4ki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Puolam=auml=ki:Kai", "Antti Ajanki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ajanki:Antti", "Samuel Kaski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaski:Samuel"], "pages": 8}
