In this paper, we propose an Abstract Interpretation framework based on higher-dimensional ellipsoids to automatically discover symbolic quadratic invariants within loops, using loop counters as implicit parameters. In order to obtain non-trivial invariants, the diameter of the set of values taken by the numerical variables of the program has to evolve (sub-)linearly during loop iterations. These invariants are called ellipsoidal cones and can be seen as an extension of constructs used in the static analysis of digital filters. Semidefinite programming is used to both compute the numerical results of the domain operations and provide proofs (witnesses) of their correctness.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Mendes Oulamara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oulamara:Mendes", "Arnaud J.
