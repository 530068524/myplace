In order to provide easier and efficient methods to accommodate physical objects into virtual space under plan, we suggest applying mixed reality (MR) interface. Our MR system consists of a video see-through display with a touch screen interface, mounted on a mobile platform, and we use screen space 3D manipulations to arrange virtual objects within the MR scene. Investigating the interface with our prototype implementation, we are convinced that our system will help users to design spaces in more easy and effective way.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Electron. & Tel ...
