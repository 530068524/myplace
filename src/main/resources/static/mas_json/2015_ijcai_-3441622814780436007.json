{"title": "Narrative Hermeneutic Circle: Improving Character Role Identification from Natural Language Text via Feedback Loops.", "fields": ["narrative", "hermeneutic circle", "architecture", "natural language", "natural language understanding"], "abstract": "While most natural language understanding systems rely on a pipeline-based architecture, certain human text interpretation methods are based on a cyclic process between the whole text and its parts: the hermeneutic circle. In the task of automatically identifying characters and their narrative roles, we propose a feedback-loop-based approach where the output of later modules of the pipeline is fed back to earlier ones. We analyze this approach using a corpus of 21 Russian folktales. Initial results show that feeding back high-level narrative information improves the performance of some NLP tasks.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "authors": ["Josep Valls-Vargas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valls=Vargas:Josep", "Jichen Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jichen", "Santiago Onta\u00f1\u00f3n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onta=ntilde==oacute=n:Santiago"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
