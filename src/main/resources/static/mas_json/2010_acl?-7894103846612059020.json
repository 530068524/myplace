{"title": "Employing Personal/Impersonal Views in Supervised and Semi-Supervised Sentiment Classification.", "fields": ["feeling", "pattern recognition", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In this paper, we adopt two views, personal and impersonal views, and systematically employ them in both supervised and semi-supervised sentiment classification. Here, personal views consist of those sentences which directly express speaker's feeling and preference towards a target object while impersonal views focus on statements towards a target object for evaluation. To obtain them, an unsupervised mining approach is proposed. On this basis, an ensemble method and a co-training algorithm are explored to employ the two views in supervised and semi-supervised sentiment classification respectively. Experimental results across eight domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (117)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Soochow University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shoushan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shoushan", "Chu-Ren Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chu=Ren", "Guodong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guodong", "Sophia Yat Mei Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sophia_Yat_Mei"], "pages": 10}
