{"title": "Morphosyntactic Tagging with a Meta-BiLSTM Model over Context Sensitive Token Encodings.", "fields": ["security token", "artificial intelligence", "recurrent neural network", "artificial neural network", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The rise of neural networks, and particularly recurrent neural networks, has produced significant advances in part-of-speech tagging accuracy. One characteristic common among these models is the presence of rich initial word encodings. These encodings typically are composed of a recurrent character-based representation with learned and pre-trained word embeddings. However, these encodings do not consider a context wider than a single word and it is only through subsequent recurrent layers that word or sub-word information interacts. In this paper, we investigate models that use recurrent neural networks with sentence-level context for initial character and word-based representations. In particular we show that optimal results are obtained by integrating these context sensitive representations through synchronized training with a meta-model that learns to combine their states. We present results on part-of-speech and morphological tagging with state-of-the-art performance on a number of languages.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "Google", "Technical University of Lisbon", "Google", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Emily Pitler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitler:Emily", "Bernd Bohnet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bohnet:Bernd", "Ryan T.
