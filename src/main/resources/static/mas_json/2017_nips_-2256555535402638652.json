In particular, given a sequence of state posteriors and the system dynamics; i) estimate the corresponding sequence of observations, ii) estimate the observation likelihoods, and iii) jointly estimate the observation likelihoods and the observation sequence. We show how to avoid a computationally expensive mixed integer linear program (MILP) by exploiting the algebraic structure of the HMM filter using simple linear algebra operations, and provide conditions for when the quantities can be uniquely reconstructed. We also propose a solution to the more general case where the posteriors are noisily observed. Finally, the proposed inverse filtering algorithms are evaluated on real-world polysomnographic data used for automatic sleep segmentation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology", "Cornell University", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Robert Mattila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mattila:Robert", "Cristian R.
