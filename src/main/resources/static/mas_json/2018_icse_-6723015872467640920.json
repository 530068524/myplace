Unfortunately, many websites are not designed to be mobile friendly. This results in problems such as unreadable text, cluttered navigation, and content overflowing a device's viewport; all of which can lead to a frustrating and poor user experience. Existing techniques are limited in helping developers repair these mobile friendly problems. To address this limitation of prior work, we designed a novel automated approach for repairing mobile friendly problems in web pages. Our empirical evaluation showed that our approach was able to successfully resolve mobile friendly problems in 95% of the evaluation subjects. In a user study, participants preferred our repaired versions of the subjects and also considered the repaired pages to be more readable than the originals.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Sheffield", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Sonal Mahajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahajan:Sonal", "Negarsadat Abolhassani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abolhassani:Negarsadat", "Phil McMinn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McMinn:Phil", "William G.
