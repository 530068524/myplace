{"title": "ConvoCons: a tool for building affinity among distributed team members.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "interface design", "user interface", "user interface design", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "In this paper we present the result of a user interface designed to increase social affinity between two remote collaborators working on design tasks. The results suggest that the tool is successful in creating an overall affinity that is 14.6% higher than the control group without adding a significant difference in task completion time. Affinity is measured with a framework with demonstrated inter-rater reliability using codes assigned to specific conversational patterns and video recorded interactions. This research approach provides a platform for future work codifying affinity and trust among larger numbers of remote collaborators.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Michael A.
