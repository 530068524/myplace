{"title": "When Subjects Interpret the Data: Social Media Non-use as a Case for Adapting the Delphi Method to CSCW.", "fields": ["social media", "delphi", "computer supported cooperative work", "delphi method", "sampling"], "abstract": "This paper describes the use of the Delphi method as a means of incorporating study participants into the processes of data analysis and interpretation. As a case study, it focuses on perceptions about use and non-use of the social media site Facebook. The work presented here involves three phases. First, a large survey included both a demographically representative sample and a convenience sample. Second, a smaller follow-up survey presented results from that survey back to survey respondents. Third, a series of qualitative member checking interviews with additional survey respondents served to validate the findings of the follow-up survey. This paper demonstrates the utility of Delphi by highlighting the ways that it enables us to synthesize across these three study phases, advancing understanding of perceptions about social media use and non-use. The paper concludes by discussing the broader applicability of the Delphi method across CSCW research.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Marquette University"], "conf": "cscw", "authors": ["Eric P.
