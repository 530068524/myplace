We explore the practices that developed as a set of course materials were released as OER from the UK, remixed for a US context by a cross-organisational, cross-cultural team, and then reused in a broad range of educational settings. We analyse the approaches taken during these remixing and reuse activities as novel forms of creative collaboration. As a basis for comparison, we explore similarities and differences with openness in other domains. We identify how openness provoked novel inter-organisational collaboration and forms of ownership; define forms of open practice that need support, and present issues that should be considered in devising and supporting open projects in education and beyond.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "Open University", "Open University"], "authors": ["Tim Coughlan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coughlan:Tim", "Rebecca Pitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitt:Rebecca", "Patrick McAndrew.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McAndrew:Patrick"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
