{"title": "Time-space hardness of learning sparse parities.", "fields": ["hamming weight", "public key cryptography", "combinatorics", "encryption", "mathematics", "discrete mathematics", "concept class", "binary logarithm"], "abstract": "We define a concept class  F  to be time-space hard (or memory-samples hard) if any learning algorithm for  F  requires either a memory of size super-linear in  n  or a number of samples super-polynomial in  n , where  n  is the length of one sample.   A recent work shows that the class of all parity functions is time-space hard [Raz, FOCS\u00e2  16]. Building on [Raz, FOCS\u00e2  16], we show that the class of all sparse parities of Hamming weight \u00e2   is time-space hard, as long as \u00e2   \u00e2 \ufffd \ufffd (log n  / loglog n ). Consequently, linear-size DNF Formulas, linear-size Decision Trees and logarithmic-size Juntas are all time-space hard. Our result is more general and provides time-space lower bounds for learning any concept class of parity functions.   We give applications of our results in the field of bounded-storage cryptography. For example, for every \ufffd (log n ) \u00e2 \ufffd  k  \u00e2 \ufffd  n , we obtain an encryption scheme that requires a private key of length  k , and time complexity of  n  per encryption/decryption of each bit, and is provably and unconditionally secure as long as the attacker uses at most  o ( nk ) memory bits and the scheme is used at most 2  o ( k )  times. Previously, this was known only for  k = n  [Raz, FOCS\u00e2  16].", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "IAS, USA"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Gillat Kol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kol:Gillat", "Ran Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Ran", "Avishay Tal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tal:Avishay"], "pages": 14}
