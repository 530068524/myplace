{"title": "Parallel Restarted Search.", "fields": ["branching", "mathematical optimization", "machine learning", "constraint programming", "heuristics"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of parallelizing restarted backtrack search. With few notable exceptions, most commercial and academic constraint programming solvers do not learn no-goods during search. Depending on the branching heuristics used, this means that there are little to no side-effects between restarts, making them an excellent target for parallelization. We develop a simple technique for parallelizing restarted search deterministically and demonstrate experimentally that we can achieve near-linear speed-ups in practice.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Oracle Corporation", "IBM"], "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 A.
