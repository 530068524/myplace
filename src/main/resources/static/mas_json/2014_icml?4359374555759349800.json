Exploiting this we have defined, developed, and tested a probabilistic programming language intermediate representation language we call probabilistic C, which itself can be compiled to machine code by standard compilers and linked to operating system libraries yielding an efficient, scalable, portable probabilistic programming compilation target. This opens up a new hardware and systems research path for optimizing probabilistic programming systems.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Brooks Paige.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paige:Brooks", "Frank D.
