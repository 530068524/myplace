{"title": "Interest Inference via Structure-Constrained Multi-Source Multi-Task Learning.", "fields": ["multi source", "machine learning", "inference", "social network", "multi task learning"], "abstract": "User interest inference from social networks is a fundamental problem to many applications. It usually exhibits dual-heterogeneities: a user's interests are complementarily and comprehensively reflected by multiple social networks; interests are inter-correlated in a nonuniform way rather than independent to each other. Although great success has been achieved by previous approaches, few of them consider these dual-heterogeneities simultaneously. In this work, we propose a structure-constrained multi-source multitask learning scheme to co-regularize the source consistency and the tree-guided task relatedness. Meanwhile, it is able to jointly learn the task-sharing and task-specific features. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset validated our scheme. In addition, we have released our dataset to facilitate the research communities.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Wuhan University of Science and Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Xuemeng Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Xuemeng", "Liqiang Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Liqiang", "Luming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Luming", "Maofu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Maofu", "Tat-Seng Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Tat=Seng"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
