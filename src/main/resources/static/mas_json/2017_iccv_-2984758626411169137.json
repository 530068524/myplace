In this paper, we propose a distributed approach to coping with this global bundle adjustment for very large scale Structurefrom-Motion computation. First, we derive the distributed formulation from the classical optimization algorithm ADMM, Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, based on the global camera consensus. Then, we analyze the conditions under which the convergence of this distributed optimization would be guaranteed. In particular, we adopt over-relaxation and self-adaption schemes to improve the convergence rate. After that, we propose to split the large scale camera-point visibility graph in order to reduce the communication overheads of the distributed computing. The experiments on both public large scale SfM data-sets and our very large scale aerial photo sets demonstrate that the proposed distributed method clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art method in efficiency and accuracy.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Runze Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Runze", "Siyu Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Siyu", "Tian Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Tian", "Long Quan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quan:Long"], "pages": 10}
