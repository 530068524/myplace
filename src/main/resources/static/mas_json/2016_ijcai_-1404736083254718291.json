Given a before-makeup face, her most suitable makeup is determined automatically. Then, both the before-makeup and the reference faces are fed into the proposed Deep Transfer Network to generate the after-makeup face. Our end-to-end makeup transfer network have several nice properties including: (1) with complete functions: including foundation, lip gloss, and eye shadow transfer; (2) cosmetic specific: different cosmetics are transferred in different manners; (3) localized: different cosmetics are applied on different facial regions; (4) producing naturally looking results without obvious artifacts; (5) controllable makeup lightness: various results from light makeup to heavy makeup can be generated. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our network performs much better than the methods of [Guo and Sim, 2009] and two variants of NerualStyle [Gatys et al., 2015a].", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Si Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Si", "Xinyu Ou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ou:Xinyu", "Ruihe Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Ruihe", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0164:Wei", "Xiaochun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xiaochun"], "pages": 8}
