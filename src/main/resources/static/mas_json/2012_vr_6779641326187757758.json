With existing navigation systems, the surgeon must turn away from the patient to view the imaging data on a separate monitor. In this study, an innovative system is introduced that illustrates the tumor boundaries precisely augmented on the spot where the tumor is located with regard to the patient. Additionally, it allows the surgeon to track the distal end of the tools contextually, where direct visualization is not possible. In this approach, the tracking system is compact and worn by the surgeon, eliminating the need for additional devices that are bulky and typically limited by line of sight constraints.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Juxtopia, LLC"], "authors": ["Ehsan Azimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azimi:Ehsan", "Jayfus Doswell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doswell:Jayfus", "Peter Kazanzides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazanzides:Peter"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
