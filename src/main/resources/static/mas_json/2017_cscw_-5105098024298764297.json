{"title": "Immersive Street-level Social Media in the 3D Virtual City: Anticipated User Experience and Conceptual Development.", "fields": ["immersion", "user experience design", "focus group", "virtual machine", "social media"], "abstract": "In this paper we explore immersive street-level integration of social media content into collaborative virtual 3D city environments on two levels: i) public, where the virtual environment is populated with relevant social media content (e.g. Twitter and Facebook feeds of shops, non-governmetal organizations, the City organization); and ii) personal, where the virtual user, through his/her avatar, is able to access his/her personal social media feeds while immersed in the virtual city. We conducted a qualitative anticipated user experience study with 14 participants in four focus groups, who were asked to create designs of how they imagined social networking services could be integrated into virtual city environments. Further, participants were asked to comment on two visual concepts created by researchers. Results show that people appreciate the concept of having virtual cities populated with up-to-date content from social media services, but linking their own social media accounts is a more complex issue.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Hannu Kukka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kukka:Hannu", "Minna Pakanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pakanen:Minna", "Mahmoud Badri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badri:Mahmoud", "Timo Ojala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ojala:Timo"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
