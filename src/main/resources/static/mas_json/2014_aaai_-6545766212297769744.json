GFODDs generalize function-free first order logic and include numerical values and numerical generalizations of existential and universal quantification. Previous work presented heuristic inference algorithms for GFODDs and implemented these heuristics in systems for decision theoretic planning. In this paper, we study the complexity of the computational problems addressed by such implementations. In particular, we study the evaluation problem, the satisfiability problem, and the equivalence problem for GFODDs under the assumption that the size of the intended model is given with the problem, a restriction that guarantees decidability. Our results provide a complete characterization placing these problems within the polynomial hierarchy. The same characterization applies to the corresponding restriction of problems in first order logic, giving an interesting new avenue for efficient inference when the number of objects is bounded. Our results show that for \u03a3k\u03a3k formulas, and for corresponding GFODDs, evaluation and satisfiability are \u03a3kP complete, and equivalence is \u03a0k+1P complete. For \u03a0k\u03a0k formulas evaluation is \u03a0kP complete, satisfiability is one level higher and is \u03a3k+1P complete, and equivalence is \u03a0k+1P complete.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tufts University", "Tufts University", "Tufts University", "Tufts University"], "authors": ["Benjamin J.
