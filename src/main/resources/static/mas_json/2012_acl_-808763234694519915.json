{"title": "Mixing Multiple Translation Models in Statistical Machine Translation.", "fields": ["transfer based machine translation", "example based machine translation", "domain adaptation", "synchronous context free grammar", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "Statistical machine translation is often faced with the problem of combining training data from many diverse sources into a single translation model which then has to translate sentences in a new domain. We propose a novel approach, ensemble decoding, which combines a number of translation systems dynamically at the decoding step. In this paper, we evaluate performance on a domain adaptation setting where we translate sentences from the medical domain. Our experimental results show that ensemble decoding outperforms various strong baselines including mixture models, the current state-of-the-art for domain adaptation in machine translation.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "National Research Council", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Majid Razmara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Razmara:Majid", "George Foster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foster:George", "Baskaran Sankaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankaran:Baskaran", "Anoop Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar:Anoop"], "pages": 10}
