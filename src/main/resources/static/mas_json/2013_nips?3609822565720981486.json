We apply this method to latent Dirichlet allocation in an online mini-batch setting, and demonstrate that it achieves substantial performance improvements over the state of the art online variational Bayesian methods.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "departments": ["University College London", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Sam Patterson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patterson:Sam", "Yee Whye Teh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teh:Yee_Whye"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
