Synergies can be obtained by integrating personalization between several Internet properties. In this paper we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model to address these issues. Our model allows the integration of multiple properties without changing the overall structure, which makes it easily extensible across large Internet portals. It relies at its lowest level on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, while making use of latent side features for cross-property integration. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by analyzing data from several properties of a major Internet portal.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Yucheng Low.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Low:Yucheng", "Deepak Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Deepak", "Alexander J.
