More accurately, the seed length of our generator is O(log n) for any constant error \\({\\epsilon > 0}\\) . In fact, we obtain our generator by fooling distributions generated by low-degree polynomials, over \\({\\mathbb{F}_p}\\) , when evaluated on the Boolean cube. This result significantly extends previous constructions that either required a long seed (Luby et al. 1993) or could only fool the distribution generated by linear functions over \\({\\mathbb{F}_p}\\) , when evaluated on the Boolean cube (Lovett et al. 2009; Meka & Zuckerman 2009).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Institute for Advanced Study", "Chennai Mathematical Institute", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Chennai Mathematical Institute", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar", "Partha Mukhopadhyay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukhopadhyay:Partha", "Amir Shpilka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shpilka:Amir"], "pages": 10}
