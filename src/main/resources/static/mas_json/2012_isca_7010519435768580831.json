Currently, servers use DDR3 memory, which is designed for high bandwidth but not for energy proportionality. A system using 20% of the peak DDR3 bandwidth consumes 2.3x the energy per bit compared to the energy consumed by a system with fully utilized memory bandwidth. Nevertheless, many datacenter applications stress memory capacity and latency but not memory bandwidth. In response, we architect server memory systems using mobile DRAM devices, trading peak bandwidth for lower energy consumption per bit and more efficient idle modes. We demonstrate 3-5x lower memory power, better proportionality, and negligible performance penalties for datacenter workloads.", "citation": "Citations (193)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Duke University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Krishna T.
