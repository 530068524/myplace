{"title": "UbiMount: 2nd workshop on ubiquitous computing in the mountains.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "climbing", "multimedia", "cycling", "wearable computer"], "abstract": "Mobile and wearable computing has great potential to support alpine outdoor sport activities. This includes, but is not limited to, rock climbing, hiking, mountain biking, paragliding, and skiing. Interestingly, technology for tracking, monitoring and supporting sport activities is broadly used in sports like running or cycling, but has not reached  the top of the mountains  yet. Nevertheless, such technologies could support people in many  mountain scenarios  such as activity tracking, navigation, or emergency support. Technologies and applications for mountaineers can learn from ubiquitous computing research in many ways to provide more joyful, motivating and safer outdoor experiences.   This workshop is building on the ideas and findings of the successful UbiMount '16 workshop and aims to further explore the newly established research direction of ubiquitous computing in the mountains. During this one day workshop the participants will present their positions and research, followed by a demo session and group exercises.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Brigham Young University", "Lancaster University", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"], "authors": ["Florian Daiber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daiber:Florian", "Michael Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones:Michael", "Frederik Wiehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiehr:Frederik", "Keith Cheverst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheverst:Keith", "Felix Kosmalla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosmalla:Felix", "Jonna H\u00e4kkil\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=kkil=auml=:Jonna"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
