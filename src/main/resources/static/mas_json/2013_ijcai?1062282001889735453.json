{"title": "Data Mining a Trillion Time Series Subsequences Under Dynamic Time Warping.", "fields": ["dynamic time warping", "bottleneck", "subroutine", "euclidean distance", "nearest neighbor search"], "abstract": "Most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine, and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series data mining algorithms. The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problems at scales that would otherwise be untenable.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Kasetsart University", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "Brigham and Women's Hospital"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Thanawin Rakthanmanon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rakthanmanon:Thanawin", "Eamonn J.
