To meet stringent reliability requirements of industrial applications, industrial standards such as WirelessHART adopt Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) as its MAC protocol. Since every link hops through all the channels used in TSCH, a straightforward policy to ensure reliability is to retain a link in the network topology only if it is reliable in all channels used. However, this policy has surprising side effects. While using more channels may enhance reliability due to channel diversity, more channels may also reduce the number of links and route diversity in the network topology. We empirically analyze the impact of channel selection on network topology, routing, and scheduling on a 52-node WSAN testbed. We observe inherent tradeoff between channel diversity and route diversity in channel selection, where using an excessive number of channels may negatively impact routing and scheduling. We propose novel channel and link selection strategies to improve route diversity and network schedulability. Experimental results on two different testbeds show that our algorithms can drastically improve routing and scheduling of industrial WSANs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Binghamton University", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "authors": ["Dolvara Gunatilaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gunatilaka:Dolvara", "Mo Sha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sha_0001:Mo", "Chenyang Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Chenyang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
