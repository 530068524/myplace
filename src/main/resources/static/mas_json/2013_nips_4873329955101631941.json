The test has a hyperparameter that allows one to control the tradeoff between sample complexity and computational time. Our family of tests, which we denote as B-tests, is both computationally and statistically efficient, combining favorable properties of previously proposed MMD two-sample tests. It does so by better leveraging samples to produce low variance estimates in the finite sample case, while avoiding a quadratic number of kernel evaluations and complex null-hypothesis approximation as would be required by tests relying on one sample U-statistics. The B-test uses a smaller than quadratic number of kernel evaluations and avoids completely the computational burden of complex null-hypothesis approximation while maintaining consistency and probabilistically conservative thresholds on Type I error. Finally, recent results of combining multiple kernels transfer seamlessly to our hypothesis test, allowing a further increase in discriminative power and decrease in sample complexity.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University College London", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Wojciech Zaremba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaremba:Wojciech", "Arthur Gretton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gretton:Arthur", "Matthew B.
