We propose a query language for graph databases that supports arbitrary attributes on nodes, edges, and graphs. In this language, graphs are the basic unit of information and each query manipulates one or more collections of graphs. To allow for flexible compositions of graph structures, we extend the notion of formal languages from strings to the graph domain. We present a graph algebra extended from the relational algebra in which the selection operator is generalized to graph pattern matching and a composition operator is introduced for rewriting matched graphs. Then, we investigate access methods of the selection operator. Pattern matching over large graphs is challenging due to the NP-completeness of subgraph isomorphism. We address this by a combination of techniques: use of neighborhood subgraphs and profiles, joint reduction of the search space, and optimization of the search order. Experimental results on real and synthetic large graphs demonstrate that our graph specific optimizations outperform an SQL-based implementation by orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (344)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Huahai He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Huahai", "Ambuj K.
