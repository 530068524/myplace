{"title": "Sound/tracks: real-time synaesthetic sonification and visualisation of passing landscapes.", "fields": ["sonification", "train", "mobile music", "contemplation", "midi"], "abstract": "When travelling on a train, many people enjoy looking out of the window at the landscape passing by. We present sound/tracks, an application that translates the perceived movement of the scenery and other visual impressions, such as passing trains, into music. The continuously changing view outside the window is captured with a camera and translated into MIDI events that are replayed instantaneously. This allows for a reflection of the visual impression, adding a sound dimension to the visual experience and deepening the state of contemplation. The application is intended to be run on both mobile phones (with built-in camera) and on laptops (with a connected Web-cam). We propose and discuss different approaches to translating the video signal into an audio stream, present different application scenarios, and introduce a method to visualise the dynamics of complete train journeys by \"re-transcribing\" the captured video frames used to generate the music.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz"], "authors": ["Tim Pohle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pohle:Tim", "Peter Knees.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knees:Peter", "Gerhard Widmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widmer:Gerhard"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
