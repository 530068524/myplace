We propose a hierarchical scheduling interface called synchronized deferrable servers that can reserve different processor bandwidth on each core, and can combine global and partitioned scheduling on a multicore platform. Significant challenges will arise in the response time analysis of a task set if the tasks are globally scheduled on a multiprocessor platform and the processor bandwidth reserved for the tasks on each processor is different, as a result, existing works on response time analysis for dedicated scheduling on identical multiprocessor platforms are no longer applicable. A new response time analysis that overcomes these challenges is presented and evaluated by simulations. Based on this new analysis, we show that evenly allocating bandwidth across cores is \"better\" than other allocation schemes in terms of schedulability, and that the threshold between lightweight and heavyweight tasks under hierarchical scheduling may be different from the threshold under dedicated scheduling.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Haitao Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Haitao", "Steve Goddard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goddard:Steve", "Matthew B.
