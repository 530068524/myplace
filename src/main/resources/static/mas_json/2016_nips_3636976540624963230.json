{"title": "A Constant-Factor Bi-Criteria Approximation Guarantee for k-means++.", "fields": ["gibbs sampling", "beta", "k means clustering", "cluster analysis", "sampling"], "abstract": "This paper studies the $k$-means++ algorithm for clustering as well as the class of $D^\\ell$ sampling algorithms to which $k$-means++ belongs. It is shown that for any constant factor $\\beta > 1$, selecting $\\beta k$ cluster centers by $D^\\ell$ sampling yields a constant-factor approximation to the optimal clustering with $k$ centers, in expectation and without conditions on the dataset. This result extends the previously known $O(\\log k)$ guarantee for the case $\\beta = 1$ to the constant-factor bi-criteria regime. It also improves upon an existing constant-factor bi-criteria result that holds only with constant probability.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IBM"], "authors": ["Dennis Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Dennis"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
