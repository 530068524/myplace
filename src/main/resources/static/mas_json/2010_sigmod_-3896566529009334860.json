Existing data repair approaches are either fully automated or not efficient in interactively involving the users. We present a demo of GDR, a  Guided Data Repair  system that uses a novel approach to efficiently involve the user alongside automatic data repair techniques to reach better data quality as quickly as possible. Specifically, GDR generates data repairs and acquire feedback on them that would be most beneficial in improving the data quality. GDR quantifies the data quality benefit of generated repairs by combining mechanisms from decision theory and active learning. Based on these benefit scores, groups of repairs are ranked and displayed to the user. User feedback is used to train a machine learning component to eventually replace the user in deciding on the validity of a suggested repair. We describe how the generated repairs are ranked and displayed to the user in a \"useful-looking\" way and demonstrate how data quality can be effectively improved with minimal feedback from the user.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mohamed Yakout.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yakout:Mohamed", "Ahmed K.
