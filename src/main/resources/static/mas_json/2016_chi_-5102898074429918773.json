{"title": "Project Jacquard: Interactive Digital Textiles at Scale.", "fields": ["interactivity", "wearable computer", "textile", "clothing", "yarn"], "abstract": "Project Jacquard  presents manufacturing technologies that enable deploying  invisible ubiquitous interactivity  at scale. We propose novel interactive textile materials that can be manufactured inexpensively using existing textile weaving technology and equipment.   The development of touch-sensitive textiles begins with the design and engineering of a new highly conductive yarn. The yarns and textiles can be produced by standard textile manufacturing processes and can be dyed to any color, made with a number of materials, and designed to a variety of thicknesses and textures to be consistent with garment designers' needs.   We describe the development of yarn, textiles, garments, and user interactivity; we present the opportunities and challenges of creating a manufacturable interactive textile for wearable computing.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ivan Poupyrev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poupyrev:Ivan", "Nan-Wei Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Nan=Wei", "Shiho Fukuhara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukuhara:Shiho", "Mustafa Emre Karagozler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karagozler:Mustafa_Emre", "Carsten Schwesig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwesig:Carsten", "Karen E.
