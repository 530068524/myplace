Since the GUI is often the only component that humans interact with, it demands for thorough testing to ensure an efficient and satisfactory user experience. Being the glue between almost all of an application's components, GUIs also lend themselves for system level testing. However, GUI testing is inherently difficult and often involves great manual labor, even with modern tools which promise automation. This paper introduces a Java library called GUITest, which allows to generate fully automated GUI robustness tests for complex applications, without the need to manually generate models or input sequences. We will explain how it operates and present first results on its applicability and effectivity during a test involving Microsoft Word.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Valencia", "Polytechnic University of Valencia"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Sebastian Bauersfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauersfeld:Sebastian", "Tanja E.
