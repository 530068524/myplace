{"title": "Data Structure Engineering For Byte-Addressable Non-Volatile Memory.", "fields": ["component based software engineering", "universal memory", "byte", "programming paradigm", "non volatile memory"], "abstract": "Storage Class Memory (SCM) is emerging as a viable alternative to traditional DRAM, alleviating its scalability limits, both in terms of capacity and energy consumption, while being non-volatile. Hence, SCM has the potential to become a universal memory, blurring well-known storage hierarchies. However, along with opportunities, SCM brings many challenges. In this tutorial we will dissect SCM challenges and provide an in-depth view of existing programming models that circumvent them, as well as novel data structures that stem from these models. We will also elaborate on fail-safety testing challenges -- an often overlooked, yet important topic. Finally, we will discuss SCM emulation techniques for end-to-end testing of SCM-based software components. In contrast to surveys investigating the use of SCM in database systems, this tutorial is designed as a programming guide for researchers and professionals interested in leveraging SCM in database systems.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ismail Oukid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oukid:Ismail", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "pages": 6}
