However, existing methods focus on recovering a low-rank tensor contaminated by Gaussian or gross sparse noise and hence cannot effectively handle outliers that are common in practical tensor data. To solve this issue, we propose an outlier-robust tensor principle component analysis (OR-TPCA) method for simultaneous low-rank tensor recovery and outlier detection. For intrinsically low-rank tensor observations with arbitrary outlier corruption, OR-TPCA is the first method that has provable performance guarantee for exactly recovering the tensor subspace and detecting outliers under mild conditions. Since tensor data are naturally high-dimensional and multi-way, we further develop a fast randomized algorithm that requires small sampling size yet can substantially accelerate OR-TPCA without performance drop. Experimental results on four tasks: outlier detection, clustering, semi-supervised and supervised learning, clearly demonstrate the advantages of our method.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Pan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Pan", "Jiashi Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jiashi"], "pages": 9}
