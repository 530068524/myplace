{"title": "On Scheduling for Minimizing End-to-End Buffer Usage over Multihop Wireless Networks.", "fields": ["queueing theory", "buffer overflow", "end to end principle", "schedule", "general topology"], "abstract": "While there has been much progress in designing backpressure based stabilizing algorithms for multihop wireless networks, end-to-end performance (e.g., end-to-end buffer usage) results have not been as forthcoming. In this paper, we study the end-to-end buffer usage (sum of buffer utilization along a flow path) over a network with general topology and with fixed, loop-free routes using a large-deviations approach. We first derive bounds on the best performance that any scheduling algorithm can achieve. Based on the intuition from the bounds, we propose a class of (backpressure-like) scheduling algorithms called \u03b1\u03b2-algorithms. We show that the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 can be chosen such that the system under the \u03b1\u03b2-algorithm performs arbitrarily closely to the best possible scheduler (formally the decay rate function for end-to-end buffer overflow is shown to be arbitrarily close to optimal in the large-buffer regime). We also develop variants which have the same asymptotic optimality property, and also provide good performance in the small-buffer regime. Our results are substantiated using both analysis and simulation.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Iowa State University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["V.
