{"title": "Minimizing Sparse High-Order Energies by Submodular Vertex-Cover.", "fields": ["submodular set function", "special case", "belief propagation", "hierarchical clustering", "vertex cover"], "abstract": "Inference in high-order graphical models has become important in recent years. Several approaches are based, for example, on generalized message-passing, or on transformation to a pairwise model with extra 'auxiliary' variables. We focus on a special case where a much more efficient transformation is possible. Instead of adding variables, we transform the original problem into a comparatively small instance of submodular vertex-cover. These vertex-cover instances can then be attacked by existing algorithms (e.g. belief propagation, QPBO), where they often run 4-15 times faster and find better solutions than when applied to the original problem. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data, then we show applications within a fast hierarchical clustering and model-fitting framework.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Western Ontario", "Moscow State University", "University of Western Ontario"], "authors": ["Andrew Delong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delong:Andrew", "Olga Veksler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veksler:Olga", "Anton Osokin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osokin:Anton", "Yuri Boykov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boykov:Yuri"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
