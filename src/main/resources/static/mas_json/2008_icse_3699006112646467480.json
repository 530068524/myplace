We also proposed  atomic-set serializability  as a correctness criterion for concurrent programs, stating that units of work must be serializable for each atomic set. We showed that a set of problematic data access patterns characterize executions that are not atomic-set serializable. Our criterion subsumes data races (single-location atomic sets) and serializability (all locations in one set).   In this paper, we present a dynamic analysis for detecting violations of atomic-set serializability. The analysis can be implemented efficiently, and does not depend on any specific synchronization mechanism. We implemented the analysis and evaluated it on a suite of real programs and benchmarks. We found a number of known errors as well as several problems not previously reported.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Christian Hammer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hammer_0001:Christian", "Julian Dolby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dolby:Julian", "Mandana Vaziri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaziri:Mandana", "Frank Tip.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tip:Frank"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
