{"title": "Libra: Impact assessment of cellular load balancing.", "fields": ["service provider", "quality of service", "computer network", "impact assessment", "load balancing"], "abstract": "Load on cellular towers is one of the key metrics that cellular service providers monitor as part of their operational and management tasks. Increased load on the towers can lead to congestion, which in turn can severely degrade quality of service perceived by users. Hence, it is of great interest to cellular service providers to minimize the maximum load at cell towers, and thereby minimize chances of congestion in the event of a sudden increase in load due to user demand changes. This goal can be achieved by proactive load balancing among neighboring cell towers, i.e., proactively identify opportunities to balance the load through re-binding of users from heavily loaded cell towers to lightly loaded neighboring towers. In this paper, we propose a new tool Libra to effectively assess the impact of load balancing related parameter changes. Libra provides an objective measure of the degree of load imbalance across multiple network locations and identifies if the measure improves or degrades after parameter changes. Our evaluation of Libra using real-world data collected from a large cellular provider demonstrates its effectiveness in accurately capturing the degree of imbalance at multiple cell towers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs"], "authors": ["Kanthi Nagaraj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagaraj:Kanthi", "Ajay Mahimkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahimkar:Ajay", "Zihui Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Zihui", "Aman Shaikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shaikh:Aman", "Jia Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Jia", "Kevin Mohr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohr:Kevin", "Mark Stockert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stockert:Mark"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
