It classifies runtime verification in identifying its distinguishing features to model checking and testing, respectively. It introduces a three-valued semantics (with truth values  true, false, inconclusive ) as an adequate interpretation as to whether a partial observation of a running system meets an LTL or TLTL property.   For LTL, a conceptually simple monitor generation procedure is given, which is  optimal  in two respects: First, the size of the generated deterministic monitor is  minimal , and, second, the monitor identifies a continuously monitored trace as either satisfying or falsifying a property  as early as possible . The feasibility of the developed methodology is demontrated using a collection of real-world temporal logic specifications. Moreover, the presented approach is related to the properties monitorable in general and is compared to existing concepts in the literature. It is shown that the set of  monitorable properties  does not only encompass the  safety  and  cosafety  properties but is strictly larger.   For TLTL, the same road map is followed by first defining a three-valued semantics. The corresponding construction of a timed monitor is more involved, yet, as shown, possible.", "citation": "Citations (406)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "University of Paris", "University of Paris", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "University of Warwick", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Australian National University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "SRI International", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Giuseppe De Giacomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacomo:Giuseppe_De", "Moshe Y.
