This is achieved by generalizing the multilayer kernel introduced in the context of convolutional kernel networks and by studying the geometry of the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that the signal representation is stable, and that models from this functional space, such as a large class of convolutional neural networks, may enjoy the same stability.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alberto Bietti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bietti:Alberto", "Julien Mairal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mairal:Julien"], "pages": 11}
