Satori uses enlightenments in guest operating systems to detect sharing opportunities and manage the surplus memory that results from sharing. Our approach has three key benefits over existing systems: it is better able to detect short-lived sharing opportunities, it is efficient and incurs negligible overhead, and it maintains performance isolation between virtual machines.\n\nWe present Satori in terms of hypervisor-agnostic design decisions, and also discuss our implementation for the Xen virtual machine monitor. In our evaluation, we show that Satori quickly exploits up to 94% of the maximum possible sharing with insignificant performance overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate workloads where the additional memory improves macrobenchmark performance by a factor of two.", "citation": "Citations (214)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "Nvidia"], "authors": ["Grzegorz Milos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milos:Grzegorz", "Derek Gordon Murray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray:Derek_Gordon", "Steven Hand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hand:Steven", "Michael A.
