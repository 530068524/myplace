Its main application is ontology-based data access, where ontologies are used to provide background knowledge for answering queries over data. We investigate the corresponding notion of query inseparability (or equivalence) for OWL 2 QL ontologies and show that deciding query inseparability is PSPACE-hard and in EXPTIME. We give polynomial time (incomplete) algorithms and demonstrate by experiments that they can be used for practical module extraction.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Liverpool", "Birkbeck, University of London", "University of Liverpool", "University of Bremen", "University of Liverpool"], "authors": ["Boris Konev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konev:Boris", "Roman Kontchakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontchakov:Roman", "Michel Ludwig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ludwig:Michel", "Thomas Schneider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schneider_0002:Thomas", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank", "Michael Zakharyaschev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zakharyaschev:Michael"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
