One main challenge in OT research is to detect and resolve puzzles -- characteristic collaboration scenarios or transformation cases in which an OT system may fail to produce consistent results. A long-standing open issue is whether we can find and solve all possible puzzles in OT systems supporting string-wise operations under well-defined consistency requirements. In this paper, we present our research that solves this open problem and a set of concrete string-wise transformation functions capable of solving all known puzzles and preserving well-defined consistency requirements. Our results contribute to the advancement of state-of-the-art of OT fundamental knowledge and technological innovation.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Chengzheng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Chengzheng", "Yi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yi", "Agustina Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Agustina"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
