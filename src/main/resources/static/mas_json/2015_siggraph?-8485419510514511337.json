The recently unveiled Android Wear operating system addresses this demand by providing a modern system for all those companies that are now developing wearable devices, also known as \"wearables\". Wearability of robotic devices will enable novel forms of human intention recognition through haptic signals and novel forms of communication between humans and robots. Specifically, wearable haptics will enable devices to communicate with humans during their interaction with the environment they share. Wearable haptic technology have been introduced in our everyday life by Sony. In 1997 its DualShock controller for PlayStation revolutionized the gaming industry by introducing a simple but effective vibrotactile feedback. More recently, Apple unveiled the Apple Watch, which embeds a linear actuator that can make the watch vibrate. It is used whenever the wearer receives an alert or notification, or to communicate with other Apple Watch owners.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Siena", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"], "authors": ["Stefano Scheggi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheggi:Stefano", "Leonardo Meli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meli:Leonardo", "Claudio Pacchierotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pacchierotti:Claudio", "Domenico Prattichizzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prattichizzo:Domenico"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
