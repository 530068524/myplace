In this paper, we obtain a refined structural understanding of PMDs by analyzing their Fourier transform. As our core structural result, we prove that the Fourier transform of PMDs is  approximately sparse , i.e., its  L  1 -norm is small outside a small set. By building on this result, we obtain the following applications:       Learning Theory.  We give the first computationally efficient learning algorithm for PMDs under the total variation distance. Our algorithm learns an ( n ,  k )-PMD within variation distance e using a near-optimal sample size of  O   k  (1/e 2 ), and runs in time  O   k  (1/e 2 ) \u00b7 log n . Previously, no algorithm with a (1/e) runtime was known, even for  k =3.       Game Theory.  We give the first efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS) for computing Nash equilibria in anonymous games. For normalized anonymous games with  n  players and  k  strategies, our algorithm computes a well-supported e-Nash equilibrium in time  n   O ( k  3 )  \u00b7 ( k /e)  O ( k  3 log( k /e)/loglog( k /e))  k \u22121  . The best previous algorithm for this problem\u00a0[  ,   ] had running time  n  ( f ( k )/e)  k   , where  f ( k ) = \u03a9( k   k  2  ), for any  k >2.       Statistics.  We prove a multivariate central limit theorem (CLT) that relates an arbitrary PMD to a discretized multivariate Gaussian with the same mean and covariance, in total variation distance. Our new CLT strengthens the CLT of Valiant and Valiant\u00a0[  ,   ] by removing the dependence on  n  in the error bound.      Along the way we prove several new structural results of independent interest about PMDs. These include: (i) a robust moment-matching lemma, roughly stating that two PMDs that approximately agree on their low-degree parameter moments are close in variation distance; (ii) near-optimal size proper e-covers for PMDs in total variation distance (constructive upper bound and nearly-matching lower bound). In addition to Fourier analysis, we employ a number of analytic tools, including the saddlepoint method from complex analysis, that may find other applications.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of California, San Diego", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ilias Diakonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakonikolas:Ilias", "Daniel M.
