Crucial to their use is the degree to which results from them predict user effectiveness. At first, past studies did not substantiate a relationship between system and user effectiveness; more recently, however, correlations have begun to emerge. The results of this paper strengthen and extend those findings. We introduce a novel methodology for investigating the relationship, which shows great success in establishing a significant correlation between system and user effectiveness. It is shown that users behave differently and discern differences between pairs of systems that have a very small absolute difference in test collection effectiveness. Our results strengthen the use of test collections in IR evaluation, confirming that users' effectiveness can be predicted successfully.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield", "University of Tampere"], "authors": ["Azzah Al-Maskari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Al=Maskari:Azzah", "Mark Sanderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanderson:Mark", "Paul D.
