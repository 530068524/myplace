{"title": "Online inference and enforcement of temporal properties.", "fields": ["locality of reference", "component based software engineering", "code smell", "online algorithm", "enforcement"], "abstract": "The interfaces of software components are often paired with specifications or protocols that prescribe correct and safe usage. An important class of these specifications consists of  temporal safety properties  over function or method call sequences. Because violations of these properties can lead to program crashes or subtly inconsistent program state, these properties are frequently the target of runtime monitoring techniques. However, the properties must be specified in advance, a time-consuming process. Recognizing this problem, researchers have proposed various specification inference techniques, but they suffer from imprecision and require a significant investment in developer time.   This work presents the first fully automatic dynamic technique for simultaneously learning  and  enforcing general temporal properties over method call sequences. Our technique is an online algorithm that operates over a short, finite execution history. This limited view works well in practice due to the inherent temporal locality in sequential method calls on Java objects, a property we validate empirically. We have implemented our algorithm in a practical tool for Java, Ocd, that operates with a high degree of precision and finds new defects and code smells in well-tested applications.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Mark Gabel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gabel:Mark", "Zhendong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Zhendong"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
