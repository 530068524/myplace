{"title": "PARTY Parameterized Synthesis of Token Rings.", "fields": ["linear temporal logic", "bounded function", "security token", "parameterized complexity", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Synthesis is the process of automatically constructing an implementation from a specification. In parameterized synthesis, we construct a single process such that the distributed system consisting of an arbitratry number of copies of the process satisfies a parameterized specification. In this paper, we present Party, a tool for parameterized synthesis from specifications in indexed linear temporal logic. Our approach extends SMT-based bounded synthesis, a flexible method for distributed synthesis, to parameterized specifications. In the current version, Party can be used to solve the parameterized synthesis problem for token-ring architectures. The tool can also synthesize monolithic systems, for which we provide a comparison to other state-of-the-art synthesis tools.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ayrat Khalimov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khalimov:Ayrat", "Swen Jacobs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobs:Swen", "Roderick Bloem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bloem:Roderick"], "pages": 6}
