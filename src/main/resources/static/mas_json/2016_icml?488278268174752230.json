To address this, several methods incorporate constraints obtained from users into clustering algorithms, but unfortunately do not apply to hierarchical clustering. We design an interactive Bayesian algorithm that incorporates user interaction into hierarchical clustering while still utilizing the geometry of the data by sampling a constrained posterior distribution over hierarchies. We also suggest several ways to intelligently query a user. The algorithm, along with the querying schemes, shows promising results on real data.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Sharad Vikram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vikram:Sharad", "Sanjoy Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Sanjoy"], "pages": 10}
