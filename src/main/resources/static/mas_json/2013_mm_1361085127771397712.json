{"title": "Bringing the sport stadium atmosphere to remote fans.", "fields": ["immersion", "stadium", "persuasive technology", "second screen", "affective computing"], "abstract": "While watching live sports broadcasts we do not feel so emotionally connected with the performers and the in-venue fans as if we were watching it live, where the event takes place. Moreover, both remote and in-venue fans do not share a social connection, resulting in defragmented social experiences. This work intends to establish a new paradigm that explores the use of mobile devices to enhance remote fans? interaction with a live event. This new paradigm will provide them with an emotional and social experience by bringing the stadium atmosphere, its immersion, and emotional levels, to remote supporters. As a result, remote fans will be more engaged in the broadcasted sports, and both, remote and in-venue, fans will all feel part of the same community.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Universidade Nova de Lisboa"], "authors": ["Pedro Centieiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Centieiro:Pedro"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
