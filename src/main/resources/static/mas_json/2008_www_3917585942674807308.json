{"title": "SMash: secure component model for cross-domain mashups on unmodified browsers.", "fields": ["phishing", "browser security", "computer security model", "mashup", "web 2 0"], "abstract": "Mashup applications mix and merge content (data and code) from multiple content providers in a user's browser, to provide high-value web applications that can rival the user experience provided by desktop applications. Current browser security models were not designed to support such applications and they are therefore implemented with insecure workarounds. In this paper, we present a secure component model, where components are provided by different trust domains, and can interact using a communication abstraction that allows ease of specification of a security policy. We have developed an implementation of this model that works currently in all major browsers, and addresses challenges of communication integrity and frame-phishing. An evaluation of the performance of our implementation shows that this approach is not just feasible but also practical.", "citation": "Citations (163)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Frederik De Keukelaere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keukelaere:Frederik_De", "Sumeer Bhola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhola:Sumeer", "Michael Steiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steiner:Michael", "Suresh Chari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chari:Suresh", "Sachiko Yoshihama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshihama:Sachiko"], "conf": "www", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
