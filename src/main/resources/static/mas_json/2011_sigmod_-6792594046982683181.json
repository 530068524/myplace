{"title": "Score-consistent algebraic optimization of full-text search queries with GRAFT.", "fields": ["data mining", "database", "algebraic number", "full text search", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We address two open problems involving algebraic execution of full-text search queries. First, we show how to correctly apply traditional database rewrite optimizations to full-text algebra plans with integrated scoring, and explain why existing techniques fail. Second, we show how our techniques are applied in a generic scoring framework that supports a wide class of scoring algorithms, including algorithms seen in the literature and user-defined scoring.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "A.U.E.B, Athens, Greece"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Nathan Bales.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bales:Nathan", "Alin Deutsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deutsch:Alin", "Vasilis Vassalos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vassalos:Vasilis"], "pages": 12}
