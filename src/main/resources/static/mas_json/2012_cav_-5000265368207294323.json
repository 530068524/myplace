{"title": "Efficient Controller Synthesis for Consumption Games with Multiple Resource Types.", "fields": ["vertex", "bounded function", "controller", "maximal element", "graph"], "abstract": "We introduce consumption games, a model for discrete interactive system with multiple resources that are consumed or reloaded independently. More precisely, a consumption game is a finite-state graph where each transition is labeled by a vector of resource updates, where every update is a non-positive number or \u03c9. The \u03c9 updates model the reloading of a given resource. Each vertex belongs either to player \u25a1 or player \u25c7, where the aim of player \u25a1 is to play so that the resources are never exhausted. We consider several natural algorithmic problems about consumption games, and show that although these problems are computationally hard in general, they are solvable in polynomial time for every fixed number of resource types (i.e., the dimension of the update vectors) and bounded resource updates.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Masaryk University", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Masaryk University", "Masaryk University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s Br\u00e1zdil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=aacute=zdil:Tom=aacute=s", "Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Anton\u00edn Kucera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kucera:Anton=iacute=n", "Petr Novotn\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novotn=yacute=_0001:Petr"], "pages": 16}
