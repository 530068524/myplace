Utilizing a sensors-embedded frying pan--providing projected images, LED indications, and vibration--wirelessly connected with a computer system that shows text messages with sounds, the panavi system analyzes sensors' data, recognizes users' conditions, and provides the users with situated instructions. Describing our vision, design process, implementation, and user study that outlines experience of challenging professional cooking, this paper introduces a design framework model of this recipe medium for domestic usage. Throughout revealing the design process--from ideation to the finished research artifact as a whole cooking support system--this research suggests how to design interactive systems responding to human situated actions, for use as daily commodities enriching domestic user experience.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Daisuke Uriu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uriu:Daisuke", "Mizuki Namai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Namai:Mizuki", "Satoru Tokuhisa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tokuhisa:Satoru", "Ryo Kashiwagi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kashiwagi:Ryo", "Masahiko Inami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inami:Masahiko", "Naohito Okude.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okude:Naohito"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
