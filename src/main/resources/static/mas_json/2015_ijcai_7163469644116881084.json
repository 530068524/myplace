In this paper we develop a sequential game theory model to capture the interactions among crowdfunders, the solar farm owner, and an electricity company who purchases renewable energy generated by the solar farm in a multi-period framework. By characterizing a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium, and comparing it with a benchmark model without crowdfunding, we find that under crowdfunding although the farm owner reduces its investment level, the overall green energy investment level is increased due to the contribution of crowdfunders. We also find that crowdfunding can increase the penetration of green energy in consumption and thus reduce the energy procurement cost of the electricity company. Finally, the numerical results based on real data indicates crowdfunding is a simple but effective way to boost green generation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Stony Brook University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Ronghuo Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Ronghuo", "Ying Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ying", "Nilanjan Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty:Nilanjan", "Katia P.
