{"title": "A Graphical Model Formulation of Collaborative Filtering Neighbourhood Methods with Fast Maximum Entropy Training.", "fields": ["data set", "movielens", "sufficient statistic", "neighbourhood", "collaborative filtering"], "abstract": "Item neighbourhood methods for collaborative filtering learn a weighted graph over the set of items, where each item is connected to those it is most similar to. The prediction of a user's rating on an item is then given by that rating of neighbouring items, weighted by their similarity. This paper presents a new neighbourhood approach which we call item fields, whereby an undirected graphical model is formed over the item graph. The resulting prediction rule is a simple generalization of the classical approaches, which takes into account non-local information in the graph, allowing its best results to be obtained when using drastically fewer edges than other neighbourhood approaches. A fast approximate maximum entropy training method based on the Bethe approximation is presented, which uses a simple gradient ascent procedure. When using precomputed sufficient statistics on the Movielens datasets, our method is faster than maximum likelihood approaches by two orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Aaron Defazio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Defazio:Aaron", "Tib\u00e9rio S.
