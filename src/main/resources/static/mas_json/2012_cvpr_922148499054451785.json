In this paper, we study the scale of edges, and try to answer two questions: 1) what is the scale of edges, and 2) how to calculate it. From the points of human cognition and physical interpretation, we illustrate the existence of the scale of edges and provide a quantitative definition. Then, an automatic edge scale selection approach is proposed. Finally, a cognitive experiment is conducted to validate the rationality of the detected scales. Moreover, the importance of identifying the scale of edges is also shown in applications such as boundary detection and hierarchical edge parsing.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xianming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xianming", "Changhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Changhu", "Hongxun Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Hongxun", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lei"], "pages": 8}
