Previous approaches address specific and known sources. However, many sources are unknown. To address the ubiquity of error, we propose a Confident Preserving Machine (CPM) that follows an easy-to-hard classification strategy. During training, CPM learns two confident classifiers. A confident positive classifier separates easily identified positive samples from all else, a confident negative classifier does same for negative samples. During testing, CPM then learns a person-specific classifier using \"virtual labels\" provided by confident classifiers. This step is achieved using a quasi-semi-supervised (QSS) approach. Hard samples are typically close to the decision boundary, and the QSS approach disambiguates them using spatio-temporal constraints. To evaluate CPM, we compared it with a baseline single-margin classifier and state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and boosting methods in three datasets of spontaneous facial behavior. With few exceptions, CPM outperformed baseline and state-of-the art methods.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Pittsburgh", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Beihang University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jiabei Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Jiabei", "Wen-Sheng Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Wen=Sheng", "Fernando De la Torre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torre:Fernando_De_la", "Jeffrey F.
