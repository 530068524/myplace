Such methods are grossly inefficient, often taking orders of magnitudes more data than humans to achieve reasonable performance. We propose Neural Episodic Control: a deep reinforcement learning agent that is able to rapidly assimilate new experiences and act upon them. Our agent uses a semi-tabular representation of the value function: a buffer of past experience containing slowly changing state representations and rapidly updated estimates of the value function. We show across a wide range of environments that our agent learns significantly faster than other state-of-the-art, general purpose deep reinforcement learning agents.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Alexander Pritzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pritzel:Alexander", "Benigno Uria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uria:Benigno", "Sriram Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Sriram", "Adri\u00e0 Puigdom\u00e8nech Badia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badia:Adri=agrave=_Puigdom=egrave=nech", "Oriol Vinyals.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vinyals:Oriol", "Demis Hassabis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassabis:Demis", "Daan Wierstra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wierstra:Daan", "Charles Blundell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blundell:Charles"], "pages": 10}
