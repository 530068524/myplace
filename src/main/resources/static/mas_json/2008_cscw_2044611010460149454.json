This study examines a system in a healthcare context, and uses activity as the unit of analysis. An innovative approach to measuring technology use and cooperation is applied that has potential for replication across other systems and contexts. The findings provide evidence that technology use and cooperation can be operationalized and examined in context and demonstrate how it can be done reliably. The results show the importance of understanding the participation of different roles within a CSCW context and the factors of technology use impact levels of cooperation.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Missouri", "University of Missouri", "University of Missouri"], "authors": ["Pei-Ju Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Pei=Ju", "James M.
