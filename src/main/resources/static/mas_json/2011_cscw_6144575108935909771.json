The model proposed here is built on research that demonstrated how human \"sensors\" can detect unusual or unexpected changes in a psychological construct, trustworthiness, based on observed virtual behavior.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Shuyuan Mary Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Shuyuan_Mary", "Xiangmin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiangmin"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
