Clearly, the obesity epidemic represents a growing societal concern. One challenge in weight control is the difficulty of tracking food calories consumed and calories expended by activity. This paper presents a system for automatic monitoring of calories expended using a single body-worn accelerometer. Our system uses activity inference combined with signal analysis to estimate calories expended in real-time using regression formulas developed by the American College of Sports Medicine. To validate our system, we have collected data from 51 subjects in a laboratory setting using a treadmill and a more natural field test. Actual caloric expenditure was determined using the medical \"gold standard\" measurement, of oxygen consumption. We are able to achieve 89% accuracy with lab data and 79% with field data -- both high enough to be useful in practice.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Jonathan Lester.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lester:Jonathan", "Carl Hartung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartung:Carl", "Laura Pina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pina:Laura", "Ryan Libby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Libby:Ryan", "Gaetano Borriello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borriello:Gaetano", "Glen Duncan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duncan:Glen"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
