{"title": "Automated dynamic offset applied to cell association.", "fields": ["extensive form game", "solution concept", "best response", "bayesian game", "price of anarchy"], "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian game framework for automated dynamic offset selection. Users compete to maximize their throughput by picking the best locally serving radio access network (RAN) with respect to their own measurement, their demand and a partial statistical channel state information (CSI) of other users. In particular, we investigate the properties of a Stackelberg game, in which the base station is a player on its own. We derive analytically the utilities related to the channel quality perceived by users to obtain the equilibria. We study the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of such system, where the PoA is the ratio of the social welfare attained when a network planner chooses policies to maximize social welfare versus the social welfare attained in Nash/Stackeleberg equilibrium when users choose their policies strategically.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Avignon", "Wroc\u0142aw University of Technology", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Majed Haddad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haddad:Majed", "Habib B.
