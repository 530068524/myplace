{"title": "Perceived forward velocity increases with tactile flow on seat pan.", "fields": ["optical flow", "peripheral vision", "vibration", "simulation", "stimulation"], "abstract": "We conducted a user study to clarify whether a tactile flow created by a matrix of vibrators in a seat pan simultaneously presented with an optical flow in peripheral vision enhances the perceived forward velocity of self-motion. A brief tactile motion stimulus consisted of four successive rows of vibration, and the inter-stimulus onset between the tactile rows was varied to change the velocity of the tactile motion. The experimental results show that the velocity of self-motion is significantly overestimated for rapid tactile flows and underestimated for slow tactile flows, compared with only optical flow or non-motion vibrotactile stimulation conditions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "University of Tokyo", "Tokyo Metropolitan University"], "authors": ["Tomohiro Amemiya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amemiya:Tomohiro", "Koichi Hirota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirota:Koichi", "Yasushi Ikei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikei:Yasushi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
