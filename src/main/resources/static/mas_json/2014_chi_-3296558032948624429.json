We interview twenty users of Pinterest, a social curation platform. We find that through collecting, organizing, and sharing image bookmarks, users engage in processes of  everyday ideation . That is, they use digital found objects as creative resources to develop ideas for shaping their lives. Curators assemble information into new contexts, forming and sharing ideas with practical and emotional value. We investigate cognitive and social aspects of creativity that affect the digital curation practices of everyday ideation. We derive implications for the design of curation environments that support information-based ideation.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rhema Linder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linder:Rhema", "Clair Snodgrass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snodgrass:Clair", "Andruid Kerne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kerne:Andruid"], "pages": 10}
