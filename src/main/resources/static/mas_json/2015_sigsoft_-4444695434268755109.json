{"title": "OSSMETER: a software measurement platform for automatically analysing open source software projects.", "fields": ["tracking system", "software measurement", "scalability", "extensibility", "source code"], "abstract": "Deciding whether an open source software (OSS) project meets the required standards for adoption in terms of quality, maturity, activity of development and user support is not a straightforward process as it involves exploring various sources of information. Such sources include OSS source code repositories, communication channels such as newsgroups, forums, and mailing lists, as well as issue tracking systems. OSSMETER is an extensible and scalable platform that can monitor and incrementally analyse a large number of OSS projects. The results of this analysis can be used to assess various aspects of OSS projects, and to directly compare different OSS projects with each other.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of L'Aquila", "University of York", "University of Manchester", "University of York", "CWI, Netherlands"], "authors": ["Davide Di Ruscio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruscio:Davide_Di", "Dimitris S.
