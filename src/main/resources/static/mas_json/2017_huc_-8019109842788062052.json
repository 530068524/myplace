Most of us read every day at work, in the transportation, at home, etc. Except by counting the number of books a person read in a year or a month, it is very hard to quantify reading. We want to create a \"wordometer\" that counts how many words a user read. Such an application could encourage people to read more, just like pedometers encourage to walk more. We propose a demonstration of such a system based on eye movements analysis extracted from EoG glasses.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Osaka Prefecture University", "Osaka Prefecture University", "Enseirb-Matmeca ...
