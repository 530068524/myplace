To every proof of the logic, we associate a ribbon tangle which tracks the flow of tensorial negations inside the proof. The translation is functorial: it is performed by exhibiting a correspondence between the notion of dialogue category in proof theory and the notion of ribbon category in knot theory. Our main result is that the translation is also faithful: two proofs are equal modulo the equational theory of ribbon tensorial logic if and only if the associated ribbon tangles are equal up to topological deformation. This \"proof-as-tangle\" theorem may be understood as a coherence theorem for balanced dialogue categories, and as a mathematical foundation for topological game semantics.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Paris Diderot University"], "authors": ["Paul-Andr\u00e9 Melli\u00e8s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melli=egrave=s:Paul=Andr=eacute="], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
