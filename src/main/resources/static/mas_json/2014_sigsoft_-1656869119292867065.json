{"title": "Achieving lightweight trustworthy traceability.", "fields": ["traceability", "novelty", "trustworthiness", "requirements traceability", "software development process"], "abstract": "Despite the fact that traceability is a required element of almost all safety-critical software development processes, the trace data is often incomplete, inaccurate, redundant, conflicting, and outdated. As a result, it is neither trusted nor trustworthy. In this vision paper we propose a philosophical change in the traceability landscape which transforms traceability from a heavy-weight process producing untrusted trace links, to a light-weight results-oriented trustworthy solution. Current traceability practices which retard agility are cast away and replaced with a disciplined, just-in-time approach. The novelty of our solution lies in a clear separation of trusted trace links from untrusted ones, the change in perspective from `living-with' inacurate traces toward rigorous and ongoing debridement of stale links from the trusted pool, and the notion of synthesizing available `project exhaust' as evidence to systematically construct or reconstruct purposed, highly-focused trace links.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["DePaul University", "DePaul University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"], "authors": ["Jane Cleland-Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cleland=Huang:Jane", "Mona Rahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahimi:Mona", "Patrick M\u00e4der.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=auml=der:Patrick"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
