{"title": "Icon scanning: Towards next generation QR codes.", "fields": ["download", "object detection", "icon", "snapshot", "app store"], "abstract": "Undoubtedly, a key feature in the popularity of smartmobile devices is the numerous applications one can install. Frequently, we learn about an application we desire by seeing it on a review site, someone else's device, or a magazine. A user-friendly way to obtain this particular application could be by taking a snapshot of its corresponding icon and being directed automatically to its download link. Such a solution exists today for QR codes, which can be thought of as icons with a binary pattern. In this paper we extend this to App-icons and propose a complete system for automatic icon-scanning: it first detects the icon in a snapshot and then recognizes it. Icon scanning is a highly challenging problem due to the large variety of icons (\u223c500K in App-Store) and background wallpapers. In addition, our system should further deal with the challenges introduced by taking pictures of a screen. Nevertheless, the novel solution proposed in this paper provides high detection and recognition rates. We test our complete icon-scanning system on icon snapshots taken by independent users, and search them within the entire set of icons in App-Store. Our success rates are high and improve significantly on other methods.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Itamar Friedman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedman:Itamar", "Lihi Zelnik-Manor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zelnik=Manor:Lihi"], "pages": 8}
