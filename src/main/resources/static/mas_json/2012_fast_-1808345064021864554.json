{"title": "Rethinking erasure codes for cloud file systems: minimizing I/O for recovery and degraded reads.", "fields": ["code word", "erasure code", "fountain code", "tornado code", "online codes"], "abstract": "To reduce storage overhead, cloud file systems are transitioning from replication to erasure codes. This process has revealed new dimensions on which to evaluate the performance of different coding schemes: the amount of data used in recovery and when performing degraded reads. We present an algorithm that finds the optimal number of codeword symbols needed for recovery for any XOR-based erasure code and produces recovery schedules that use a minimum amount of data. We differentiate popular erasure codes based on this criterion and demonstrate that the differences improve I/O performance in practice for the large block sizes used in cloud file systems. Several cloud systems [15, 10] have adopted Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, because of their generality and their ability to tolerate larger numbers of failures. We define a new class of rotated Reed-Solomon codes that perform degraded reads more efficiently than all known codes, but otherwise inherit the reliability and performance properties of Reed-Solomon codes.", "citation": "Citations (278)", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Osama Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Osama", "Randal C.
