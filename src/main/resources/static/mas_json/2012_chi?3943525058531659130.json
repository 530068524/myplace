Panoramas are typically visualized as rectangular photographs, but this does not provide clear cues for physical directions in the environment. In this paper, we conduct a series of studies with three different shapes:  Frontal, Top-Down  and  Bird's Eye ; the last two shapes are chosen because they provide a clearer representation of the spatial mapping between panorama and environment. Our results show that good readability of the panorama is most important and that a clear representation of the spatial mapping plays a secondary role. This paper is the first to provide understanding on how users exploit 360\u00b0 panoramic over-views to locate objects in the surrounding environment and how different design factors can affect user performance.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Graz University of Technology", "HIT Lab NZ, Chr ... ch, New Zealand"], "authors": ["Alessandro Mulloni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mulloni:Alessandro", "Hartmut Seichter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seichter:Hartmut", "Andreas D\u00fcnser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=uuml=nser:Andreas", "Patrick Baudisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudisch:Patrick", "Dieter Schmalstieg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmalstieg:Dieter"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
