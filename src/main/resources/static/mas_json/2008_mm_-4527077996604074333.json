For single image, the stroke-based binarization and the coarse-to-fine text extraction will collaborate to generate a clean text image for recognition. For image sequence, multi-frame text enhancement is adopted to increase the text/background contrast, and the recognition results are finally refined by the text string combination algorithm to get more precise semantic information. Two prototype demos have been successfully developed on mobile phones. The experimental results on different platforms show the superior performance of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Lei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0009:Lei", "Yingfei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yingfei", "Kongqiao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kongqiao", "Hao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
