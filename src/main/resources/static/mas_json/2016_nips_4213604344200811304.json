Inspired by the loop perforation technique from source code optimization, we speed up the bottleneck convolutional layers by skipping their evaluation in some of the spatial positions. We propose and analyze several strategies of choosing these positions. We demonstrate that perforation can accelerate modern convolutional networks such as AlexNet and VGG-16 by a factor of 2x - 4x. Additionally, we show that perforation is complementary to the recently proposed acceleration method of Zhang et al.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics", "National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics", "National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics"], "authors": ["Mikhail Figurnov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Figurnov:Mikhail", "Aizhan Ibraimova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ibraimova:Aizhan", "Dmitry P.
