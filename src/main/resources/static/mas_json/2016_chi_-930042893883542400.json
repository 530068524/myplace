When compared to a text-only editor in a controlled experiment on 16 participants, our system showed a significant reduction in keystrokes during introductory probabilistic programming exercises, and subsequently, a significant improvement in program description and debugging tasks as measured by task time, keystrokes and deletions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Maria I.
