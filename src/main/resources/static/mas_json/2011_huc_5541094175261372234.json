Although hand shapes can express various meanings with small gestures, utilization of hand shapes as an interface is rare in domestic use. That is because a concise recognition method has not been established. To recognize hand shapes anywhere with no stress on the user, we developed a wearable wrist contour sensor device and a recognition system. In the system, features, such as sum of gaps, were extracted from wrist contours. We conducted a classification test of eight hand shapes, and realized approximately 70% classification rate.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Mitsubishi", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Rui Fukui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukui:Rui", "Masahiko Watanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watanabe:Masahiko", "Tomoaki Gyota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gyota:Tomoaki", "Masamichi Shimosaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimosaka:Masamichi", "Tomomasa Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Tomomasa"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
