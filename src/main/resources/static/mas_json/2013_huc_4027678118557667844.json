This new data source provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to massively and cheaply collect location related information, and to subtly characterize individual's fine-grained preference about those places and associated entities. In this paper, we propose SEALs - a fine-grained preference-aware location search framework leveraging the crowdsourced traces in LBSNs. We first collect user check-ins and tips from Foursquare and use them as direct user feedback on locations. Second, we extract users' sentiment about locations and associated entities from tips to characterize their fine-grained location preference. Third, we incorporate such fine-grained user preference into personalized location ranking using tensor factorization techniques. Experimental results show that SEALs can achieve better location ranking comparing to the state-of-the-art solutions.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "Northwestern Polytechnical University"], "authors": ["Dingqi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Dingqi", "Daqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Daqing", "Zhiyong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Zhiyong", "Zhiwen Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Zhiwen"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
