We propose a policy-search-based approach coupled with predictive modelling to address this problem. This approach has some key advantages compared to other alternatives, such as dynamic programming: the policy representation and search algorithm can conveniently incorporate domain knowledge; the resulting policies are easy to interpret, and the algorithm is naturally parallelizable. Our algorithm obtains a policy which outperforms the solution found by dynamic programming both quantitatively and qualitatively.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yuri Grinberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grinberg:Yuri", "Doina Precup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Precup:Doina", "Michel Gendreau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gendreau:Michel"], "pages": 9}
