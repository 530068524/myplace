To answer these questions we analyse the privacy policies of users of a real-time location sharing application, in which users actively shared their location with their contacts. The results show that users who are central to their network are more likely to reveal most about their whereabouts. Furthermore, we show that the friend most likely to know the whereabouts of a specific individual is the one with most common contacts and/or greatest number of contacts.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Madeira", "University of Madeira", "University of Madeira", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis", "Jayant Venkatanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkatanathan:Jayant", "Bernardo Reynolds.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reynolds:Bernardo", "Norman M.
