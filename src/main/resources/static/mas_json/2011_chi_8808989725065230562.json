To develop a deeper understanding of the role of space and the tradeoffs between freeform and structured interaction styles in problem solving tasks, we conducted a controlled user study comparing the DataBoard with a spreadsheet and analyzed video data in detail. Beyond improvements in task performance and memory recall, our observations reveal that freeform interfaces can support users in a variety of ways: representing problems flexibly, developing strategies, executing strategies incrementally, tracking problem state easily, reducing mental computation, and verifying solutions perceptually. The spreadsheet also had advantages, and we discuss the tradeoffs.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Eser Kandogan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kandogan:Eser", "Juho Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Juho", "Thomas P.
