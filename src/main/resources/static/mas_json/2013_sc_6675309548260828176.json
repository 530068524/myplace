Applying a disciplined performance programming methodology of sound algorithm choice, valid performance model, and well-executed optimizations, we break the tera-flop mark on a mere 64 nodes of Xeon Phi and reach 6.7 TFLOPS with 512 nodes, which is 1.5x than achievable on a same number of Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae nodes. It is a challenge to fully utilize the compute capability presented by many-core wide-vector processors for bandwidth-bound FFT computation. We leverage a new algorithm, Segment-of-Interest FFT, with low inter-node communication cost, and aggressively optimize data movements in node-local computations, exploiting caches. Our coordination of low communication algorithm and massively parallel architecture for scalable performance is not limited to running FFT on Xeon Phi; it can serve as a reference for other bandwidth-bound computations and for emerging HPC systems that are increasingly communication limited.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Intel", "Parallel Computing Lab", "Parallel Computing Lab", "Parallel Computing Lab", "Parallel Computing Lab"], "authors": ["Jongsoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jongsoo", "Ganesh Bikshandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bikshandi:Ganesh", "Karthikeyan Vaidyanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaidyanathan:Karthikeyan", "Ping Tak Peter Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Ping_Tak_Peter", "Pradeep Dubey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dubey:Pradeep", "Daehyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Daehyun"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
