Detailed usage records in smart phones, conveying a partial life log, are important for a deep scientific understanding of human characteristics. In this study, we proposed a feature-based labeling method to characterize users. Eight features from three aspects, i.e., daily mobility, user daily schedule, and social ability, are designed within a time window. Further, we analyze the features' correlation and variation over time. With the features, each user can be attached with a few semantic labels to demonstrate his/her characteristics. This work is a promising step towards drawing \"portraits\" for users using mobile phone data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Hosei University"], "authors": ["Sha Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Sha", "Yifan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yifan", "Zhe Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhe", "Zhiling Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Zhiling", "Runhe Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Runhe", "Shijian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shijian", "Gang Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan_0001:Gang"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
