We consider concurrent games: at each step, players choose their actions independently. There can be an arbitrary number of players. The preferences of the players are given by payoff functions that map states to integers, the goal for a player is then to maximize the limit superior of her payoff; this can be seen as a generalization of Buchi objectives. PRALINE looks for pure Nash equilibria in these games. It can construct the strategies of the equilibrium and users can play against it to test the equilibrium. We give the idea behind its implementation and present examples of its practical use.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Romain Brenguier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brenguier:Romain"], "pages": 6}
