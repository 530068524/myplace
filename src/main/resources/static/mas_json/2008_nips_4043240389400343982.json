{"title": "Risk Bounds for Randomized Sample Compressed Classifiers.", "fields": ["sampling", "compression", "compression set", "occam", "string"], "abstract": "We derive risk bounds for the randomized classifiers in Sample Compression setting where the classifier-specification utilizes two sources of information viz. the compression set and the message string. By extending the recently proposed Occam's Hammer principle to the data-dependent settings, we derive point-wise versions of the bounds on the stochastic sample compressed classifiers and also recover the corresponding classical PAC-Bayes bound. We further show how these compare favorably to the existing results.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["McGill University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mohak Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Mohak"], "pages": 8}
