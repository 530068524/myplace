{"title": "Images and Recipes: Retrieval in the Cooking Context.", "fields": ["artificial neural network", "semantics", "task analysis", "versa", "use case"], "abstract": "Recent advances in the machine learning community allowed different use cases to emerge, as its association to domains like cooking which created the computational cuisine. In this paper, we tackle the picture-recipe alignment problem, having as target application the large-scale retrieval task (finding a recipe given a picture, and vice versa). Our approach is validated on the Recipe1M dataset, composed of one million image-recipe pairs and additional class information, for which we achieve state-of-the-art results.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "authors": ["Micael Carvalho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carvalho:Micael", "R\u00e9mi Cad\u00e8ne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cad=egrave=ne:R=eacute=mi", "David Picard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Picard:David", "Laure Soulier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soulier:Laure", "Matthieu Cord.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cord:Matthieu"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
