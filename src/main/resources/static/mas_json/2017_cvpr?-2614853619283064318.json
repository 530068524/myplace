Existing benchmarks for visual question answering can help, but have strong biases that models can exploit to correctly answer questions without reasoning. They also conflate multiple sources of error, making it hard to pinpoint model weaknesses. We present a diagnostic dataset that tests a range of visual reasoning abilities. It contains minimal biases and has detailed annotations describing the kind of reasoning each question requires. We use this dataset to analyze a variety of modern visual reasoning systems, providing novel insights into their abilities and limitations.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Facebook", "Delft University of Technology", "Stanford University", "Facebook"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Justin Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Justin", "Bharath Hariharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hariharan:Bharath", "Laurens van der Maaten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maaten:Laurens_van_der", "Li Fei-Fei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fei=Fei:Li", "C.
