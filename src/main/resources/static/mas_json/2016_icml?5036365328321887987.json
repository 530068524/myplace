We treat these problems as maximum a posteriori inference problems in a graphical model and present a message passing approach that scales linearly with the number of observations and factors. Our empirical study demonstrates that message passing is able to recover low-rank Boolean matrices, in the boundaries of theoretically possible recovery and compares favorably with state-of-the-art in real-world applications, such collaborative filtering with large-scale Boolean data.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Siamak Ravanbakhsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravanbakhsh:Siamak", "Barnab\u00e1s P\u00f3czos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=oacute=czos:Barnab=aacute=s", "Russell Greiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greiner:Russell"], "pages": 10}
