Yet, the ability to simulate these early devices using classical computers is crucial for calibration, validation, and benchmarking. In order to make use of the full potential of systems featuring multi- and many-core processors, we use automatic code generation and optimization of compute kernels, which also enables performance portability. We apply a scheduling algorithm to quantum supremacy circuits in order to reduce the required communication and simulate a 45-qubit circuit on the Cori II super-computer using 8, 192 nodes and 0.5 petabytes of memory. To our knowledge, this constitutes the largest quantum circuit simulation to this date. Our highly-tuned kernels in combination with the reduced communication requirements allow an improvement in time-to-solution over state-of-the-art simulations by more than an order of magnitude at every scale.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Institute for T ... ch, Switzerland", "Institute for T ... ch, Switzerland"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Thomas H\u00e4ner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=ner:Thomas", "Damian S.
