{"title": "On Trivial Solution and Scale Transfer Problems in Graph Regularized NMF.", "fields": ["multiplicative function", "non negative matrix factorization", "document clustering", "nonnegative matrix", "factorization"], "abstract": "Combining graph regularization with nonnegative matrix (tri-)factorization (NMF) has shown great performance improvement compared with traditional nonnegative matrix (tri-)factorization models due to its ability to utilize the geometric structure of the documents and words. In this paper, we show that these models are not well-defined and suffering from trivial solution and scale transfer problems. In order to solve these common problems, we propose two models for graph regularized non-negative matrix (tri-)factorization, which can be applied for document clustering and co-clustering respectively. In the proposed models, a Normalized Cut-like constraint is imposed on the cluster assignment matrix to make the optimization problem well-defined. We derive a multiplicative updating algorithm for the proposed models, and prove its convergence. Experiments of clustering and coclustering on benchmark text data sets demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the original models as well as many other state-of-the-art clustering methods.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Quanquan Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Quanquan", "Chris H.
