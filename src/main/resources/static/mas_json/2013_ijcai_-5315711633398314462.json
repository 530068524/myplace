The work is developed as a collaboration of computer scientists and hydraulic engineers, and applies Constraint Logic Programming to solve a hard combinatorial problem. This application deals with one aspect of the design of a water distribution network, i.e., the valve isolation system design.\n\nWe take the formulation of the problem by Giustolisi and Savic [2008] and show how, thanks to constraint propagation, we can get better solutions than the best solution known in the literature for the Apulian distribution network.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "University of Ferrara", "University of Ferrara", "University of Ferrara", "University of Ferrara"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Massimiliano Cattafi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cattafi:Massimiliano", "Marco Gavanelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavanelli:Marco", "Maddalena Nonato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nonato:Maddalena", "Stefano Alvisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alvisi:Stefano", "Marco Franchini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Franchini:Marco"], "pages": 5}
