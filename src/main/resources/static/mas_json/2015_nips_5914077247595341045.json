To do this, we create an algorithm based on a newly defined optimization problem and analyze it. We also conduct the first experimental analysis of all efficient agnostic active learning algorithms, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses in different settings.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Columbia University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tzu-Kuo Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Tzu=Kuo", "Alekh Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Alekh", "Daniel J.
