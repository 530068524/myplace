However, when the TSPPD requires that the loading and unloading operations must be performed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner, we show that its feasible solutions can be represented by trees. Consequently, we develop a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) heuristic for the TSPPD with last-in-first-out loading (TSPPDL) involving several search operators based on the tree data structure. Experiments show that our VNS heuristic is superior to the current best heuristics for TSPPDL in terms of both solution quality and computing time.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Dejian Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Dejian", "Songshan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Songshan", "Hu Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Hu", "Wee-Chong Oon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oon:Wee=Chong", "Andrew Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Andrew"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
