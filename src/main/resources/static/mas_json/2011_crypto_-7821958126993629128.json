A collision resistance analysis for Tandem-DM achieving a similar birthday-type bound was already proposed by Fleischmann, Gorski and Lucks at FSE 2009 [3]. As we detail, however, the latter analysis is wrong, thus leaving the collision resistance of Tandem-DM as an open problem until now. Our analysis exhibits a novel feature in that we introduce a trick not used before in ideal cipher proofs.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["Sejong University", "University of Bristol", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jooyoung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Jooyoung", "Martijn Stam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stam:Martijn", "John P.
