We address challenges toward realization of large-scale dynamic social network analysis in real environment, and discuss several promising applications. We finally present our preliminary experimental results of dynamic social network analysis for six-person social gatherings in real environment.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Shizuoka University"], "authors": ["Sho Tsugawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsugawa:Sho", "Hiroyuki Ohsaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohsaki:Hiroyuki", "Yuichi Itoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Itoh:Yuichi", "Naoaki Ono.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ono:Naoaki", "Keiichiro Kagawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kagawa:Keiichiro", "Kazuki Takashima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takashima:Kazuki", "Makoto Imase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Imase:Makoto"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
