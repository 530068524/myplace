This paper deals with determining whether an incomplete preference profile is single-peaked. This is essential information since many intractable voting problems become tractable for single-peaked profiles. We prove that for incomplete profiles the problem of determining single-peakedness is NP-complete. Despite this computational hardness result, we find four polynomial-time algorithms for reasonably restricted settings.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Martin Lackner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lackner:Martin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
