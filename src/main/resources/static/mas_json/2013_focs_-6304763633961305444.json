We apply a combinatorial preprocessing, based on the Frank-Tardos algorithm for k-out connectivity, to transform any input into an instance such that the iterative rounding method gives a 2-approximation guarantee. This is the first constant-factor approximation algorithm even in the asymptotic setting of the problem, that is, the restriction to instances where the number of nodes is lower bounded by a function of k.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "London School of Economics and Political Science"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Joseph Cheriyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheriyan:Joseph", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 A.
