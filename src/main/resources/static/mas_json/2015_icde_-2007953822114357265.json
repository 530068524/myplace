{"title": "A graph-based RDF triple store.", "fields": ["wildcard character", "rdf schema", "rdf xml", "sparql", "rdf"], "abstract": "In this demonstration, we present the gStore RDF triple store. gStore is based on graph encoding and subgraph match, distinct from many other systems. More importantly, it can handle, in a uniform manner, different data types (strings and numerical data) and SPARQL queries with wildcards, aggregate, range and top-k operators over dynamic RDF datasets. We will demonstrate the main features of our system, show how to search Wikipedia documents using gStore and how to build users' own application using gStore through C++/Java API.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "University of Waterloo", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Xuchuan Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xuchuan", "Lei Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou_0001:Lei", "M.
