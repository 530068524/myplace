In particular, if e is moderately small and the size of every number used in the input instance is polynomially bounded, the running times of our algorithms match -- up to poly-logarithmic factors and some provably optimal terms -- the \u03a9(mn)   flow-decomposition barrier  for  single-commodity  flow.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Aleksander Madry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madry:Aleksander"], "pages": 10}
