The maps generated with this technique are visually appealing, very accurate and allow drift-free rotation tracking. This method runs on mobile phones at 30Hz and has applications in the creation of panoramic images for offline browsing, for visual enhancements through environment mapping and for outdoor Augmented Reality on mobile phones.", "citation": "Citations (153)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "authors": ["Daniel Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner:Daniel", "Alessandro Mulloni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mulloni:Alessandro", "Tobias Langlotz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langlotz:Tobias", "Dieter Schmalstieg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmalstieg:Dieter"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
