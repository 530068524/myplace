{"title": "Integrating Translation Memory into Phrase-Based Machine Translation during Decoding.", "fields": ["bleu", "phrase", "translation memory", "approximate string matching", "machine translation"], "abstract": "Since statistical machine translation (SMT) and translation memory (TM) complement each other in matched and unmatched regions, integrated models are proposed in this paper to incorporate TM information into phrase-based SMT. Unlike previous multi-stage pipeline approaches, which directly merge TM result into the final output, the proposed models refer to the corresponding TM information associated with each phrase at SMT decoding. On a Chinese\u2013English TM database, our experiments show that the proposed integrated Model-III is significantly better than either the SMT or the TM systems when the fuzzy match score is above 0.4. Furthermore, integrated Model-III achieves overall 3.48 BLEU points improvement and 2.62 TER points reduction in comparison with the pure SMT system. Besides, the proposed models also outperform previous approaches significantly.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kun", "Chengqing Zong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zong:Chengqing", "Keh-Yih Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Keh=Yih"], "pages": 11}
