{"title": "Multi-View Incident Ticket Clustering for Optimal Ticket Dispatching.", "fields": ["spectral clustering", "ticket", "cut", "discriminative model", "fuzzy clustering"], "abstract": "We present a novel technique that optimizes the dispatching of incident tickets to the agents in an IT Service Support Environment. Unlike the common skill-based dispatching, our approach also takes empirical evidence on the agent's speed from historical data into account. Our solution consists of two parts. First, a novel technique clusters historic tickets into incident categories that are discriminative in terms of agent's performance. Second, a dispatching policy selects, for an incoming ticket, the fastest available agent according to the target cluster. We show that, for ticket data collected from several Service Delivery Units, our new dispatching technique can reduce service time between $35\\%$ and $44\\%$.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Mirela Madalina Botezatu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Botezatu:Mirela_Madalina", "Jasmina Bogojeska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogojeska:Jasmina", "Ioana Giurgiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giurgiu:Ioana", "Hagen V\u00f6lzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/V=ouml=lzer:Hagen", "Dorothea Wiesmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiesmann:Dorothea"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
