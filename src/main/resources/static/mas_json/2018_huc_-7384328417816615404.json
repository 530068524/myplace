The length of the analysis frames is a crucial system parameter that directly influences the effectiveness of the overall approach. In this paper we present a method that optimizes the window length - individually for each target activity. Instead of employing a single, multi-class recognition system that is based on a generic window length, we combine individually optimized activity detectors into an Ensemble based recognition approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through an experimental evaluation on eight benchmark datasets. The proposed method leads to significant improvements across a range of activity recognition application domains.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Hong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hong", "Gregory D.
