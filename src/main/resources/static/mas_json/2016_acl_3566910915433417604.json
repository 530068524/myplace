{"title": "Connotation Frames: A Data-Driven Investigation.", "fields": ["connotation", "predicate", "formalism", "data driven", "news media"], "abstract": "Through a particular choice of a predicate (e.g., \"x violated y\"), a writer can subtly connote a range of implied sentiments and presupposed facts about the entities x and y: (1) writer's perspective: projecting x as an \"antagonist\"and y as a \"victim\", (2) entities' perspective: y probably dislikes x, (3) effect: something bad happened to y, (4) value: y is something valuable, and (5) mental state: y is distressed by the event. We introduce connotation frames as a representation formalism to organize these rich dimensions of connotation using typed relations. First, we investigate the feasibility of obtaining connotative labels through crowdsourcing experiments. We then present models for predicting the connotation frames of verb predicates based on their distributional word representations and the interplay between different types of connotative relations. Empirical results confirm that connotation frames can be induced from various data sources that reflect how people use language and give rise to the connotative meanings. We conclude with analytical results that show the potential use of connotation frames for analyzing subtle biases in online news media.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hannah Rashkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rashkin:Hannah", "Sameer Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh_0001:Sameer", "Yejin Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Yejin"], "pages": -1}
