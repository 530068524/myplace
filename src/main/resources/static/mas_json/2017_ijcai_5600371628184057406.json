In this paper, we focus on the reusability of pre-trained deep convolutional models. Specifically, different from treating pre-trained models as feature extractors, we reveal more treasures beneath convolutional layers, i.e., the convolutional activations could act as a detector for the common object in the image co-localization problem. We propose a simple but effective method, named Deep Descriptor Transforming (DDT), for evaluating the correlations of descriptors and then obtaining the category-consistent regions, which can accurately locate the common object in a set of images. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed DDT method. On benchmark image co-localization datasets, DDT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Moreover, DDT also demonstrates good generalization ability for unseen categories and robustness for dealing with noisy data.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "University of Adelaide", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Xiu-Shen Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Xiu=Shen", "Chen-Lin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chen=Lin", "Yao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Yao", "Chen-Wei Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Chen=Wei", "Jianxin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jianxin", "Chunhua Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chunhua", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
