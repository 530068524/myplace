Since nodes may fail due to accidental damage or energy depletion, it is desirable to construct a fault tolerant CDS, which can be modeled as a k-connected m-fold dominating set ((k, m)-CDS for short). A subset of nodes C \u2286 V(G) is a (k, m)-CDS of G if every node in V(G)\\C is adjacent with at least m nodes in C and the subgraph of G induced by C is k-connected. In this paper, we present an approximation algorithm for the minimum (3, m)-CDS problem with m > 3, which has size at most \u03b3 times that of an optimal solution, where \u03b3 = \u03b1 + 8 + 21n(2\u03b1 \u2014 6) for \u03b1 > 4 and \u03b3 = 3\u03b1 + 2 In 2 for \u03b1 < 4, and \u03b1 is the approximation ratio for the minimum (2, m)-CDS problem. This is the first performance-guaranteed algorithm for the minimum (3, m)-CDS problem in a general wireless network, and improves previous performance ratio in a homogeneous wireless sensor network by a large amount.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Zhejiang Normal University", "Zhejiang Normal University", "Zhejiang Normal University", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Zhao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Zhao", "Jiao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Jiao", "Yuchang Mo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mo:Yuchang", "Ding-Zhu Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Ding=Zhu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
