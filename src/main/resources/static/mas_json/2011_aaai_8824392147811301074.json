In modeling human decision making, a key factor is the psychological phenomenon known as \"framing\", in which the preferences of a decision maker change in response to contextual changes in decision problems. Existing approaches treat framing as a one-dimensional contextual influence based on the perception of outcomes as either gains or losses. However, empirical studies have shown that framing effects are much more multifaceted than one-dimensional views of framing suggest. To address this limitation, we propose an integrative approach to modeling framing which combines the psychological principles of cognitive appraisal theories and decision-theoretic notions of utility and probability. We show that this approach allows for both the identification and computation of the salient contextual factors in a decision as well as modeling how they ultimately affect the decision process. Furthermore, we show that our multidimensional, appraisal-based approach can account for framing effects identified in the empirical literature which cannot be addressed by one-dimensional theories, thereby promising more accurate models of human behavior.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Jonathan Yasuo Ito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ito:Jonathan_Yasuo", "Stacy Marsella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marsella:Stacy"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
