{"title": "Towards contextual and on-demand code clone management by continuous monitoring.", "fields": ["incident management", "continuous monitoring", "kpi driven code analysis", "software quality", "code review"], "abstract": "Effective clone management is essential for developers to recognize the introduction and evolution of code clones, to judge their impact on software quality, and to take appropriate measures if required. Our previous study shows that cloning practice is not simply a technical issue. It must be interpreted and considered in a larger context from technical, personal, and organizational perspectives. In this paper, we propose a contextual and on-demand code clone management approach called  CCEvents  (Code Cloning Events). Our approach provides timely notification about relevant code cloning events for different stakeholders through continuous monitoring of code repositories. It supports on-demand customization of clone monitoring strategies in specific technical, personal, and organizational contexts using a domain-specific language. We implemented the proposed approach and conducted an empirical study with an industrial project. The results confirm the requirements for contextual and on-demand code clone management and show the effectiveness of  CCEvents  in providing timely code cloning notifications and in helping to achieve effective clone management.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Gang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Gang", "Xin Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Xin", "Zhenchang Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Zhenchang", "Shihai Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Shihai", "Hai Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hai", "Wenyun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wenyun"], "pages": 11}
