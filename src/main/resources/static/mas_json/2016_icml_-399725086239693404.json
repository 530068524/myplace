{"title": "Faster Eigenvector Computation via Shift-and-Invert Preconditioning.", "fields": ["linear system", "eigengap", "matrix", "computation", "covariance matrix"], "abstract": "We give faster algorithms and improved sample complexities for the fundamental problem of estimating the top eigenvector. Given an explicit matrix A \u2208 Rn\u00d7d, we show how to compute an e approximate top eigenvector of A\u03c4A in time O ([nnz(A) + d sr(A)/gap2] \u010b log 1/e . Here nnz(A) is the number of nonzeros in A, sr(A) is the stable rank, and gap is the relative eigengap. We also consider an online setting in which, given a stream of i.i.d. samples from a distribution D with covariance matrix \u03a3 and a vector x0 which is an O(gap) approximate top eigenvector for \u03a3, we show how to refine x0 to an e approximation using O (v(D)/gap\u010be) samples from D. Here v(D) is a natural notion of variance. Combining our algorithm with previous work to initialize x0, we obtain improved sample complexities and runtimes under a variety of assumptions on D.\n\nWe achieve our results via a robust analysis of the classic shift-and-invert preconditioning method. This technique lets us reduce eigenvector computation to approximately solving a series of linear systems with fast stochastic gradient methods.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Princeton University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Washington", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Dan Garber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garber:Dan", "Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad", "Chi Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Chi", "Sham M.
