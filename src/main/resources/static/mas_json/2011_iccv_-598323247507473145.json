{"title": "Discovering object instances from scenes of Daily Living.", "fields": ["computational geometry", "activities of daily living", "computer graphics", "cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition", "image segmentation"], "abstract": "We propose an approach to identify and segment objects from scenes that a person (or robot) encounters in Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Images collected in those cluttered scenes contain multiple objects. Each image provides only a partial, possibly very different view of each object. An object instance discovery program must be able to link pieces of visual information from multiple images and extract the consistent patterns.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Hongwen Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Hongwen", "Martial Hebert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hebert:Martial", "Takeo Kanade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanade:Takeo"], "pages": 8}
