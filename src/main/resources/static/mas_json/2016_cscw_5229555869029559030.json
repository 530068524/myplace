{"title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Strategies in Peer Review Process of Online Collaboration Projects.", "fields": ["software development", "management science", "peer review", "conflict management", "constructive"], "abstract": "In online collaboration projects, conflicts often arise in the peer review process, due to the disagreement over whether one\u00e2  s contribution should be accepted. These conflicts generally have detrimental effects on contributors\u00e2   continuing participation in the community. Few studies have investigated how to manage these conflicts effectively. This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of three strategies \u00e2   rational explanation, constructive suggestion, and social encouragement \u00e2   in managing conflicts. In an analysis of 170 online software development projects, we investigated how different conflict management strategies aimed at handling contributors\u00e2   arguments during the peer review process influenced their subsequent participation in the projects. The results show that (i) conflicts significantly increase contributors\u00e2   likelihood of leaving the communities; (ii) neither rational explanations nor social encouragement could reduce the negative consequences of conflicts; (iii) only constructive suggestions have a positive effect in retaining the contributors.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "University of Minnesota", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Wenjian Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Wenjian", "Tun Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Tun", "Haiyi Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Haiyi", "Guo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Guo", "Ning Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Ning"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
