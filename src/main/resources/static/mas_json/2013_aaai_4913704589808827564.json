In this paper, we introduce coupled dictionary learning (DL) into supervised sparse coding for multi-modal (crossmedia) retrieval. We call this Supervised coupleddictionary learning with group structures for Multi-Modal retrieval (SliM2). SliM2 formulates the multimodal mapping as a constrained dictionary learning problem. By utilizing the intrinsic power of DL to deal with the heterogeneous features, SliM2 extends unimodal DL to multi-modal DL. Moreover, the label information is employed in SliM2 to discover the shared structure inside intra-modality within the same class by a mixed norm (i.e., l1= l2-norm). As a result, the multimodal retrieval is conducted via a set of jointly learned mapping functions across multi-modal data. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model when applied to cross-media retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting", "Yanfei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yanfei", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Yin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Yin", "Weiming Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Weiming"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
