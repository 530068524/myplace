Workers' mental engagement in boring tasks diminishes, which eventually, compromises their performance. The result is a double-whammy because the workers do not get job satisfaction and their employers do not receive optimal return on investment. This paper proposes a novel way for improving workers' mental engagement and hence, enjoyment, in routine activities. Specifically, we propose to blend in routine tasks mild mental/physical challenges. To test our hypothesis, we chose to experiment on a monitoring task typical of security guard operations. We combined this routine task with an iPhone-based game to make it more enjoyable. The results from 10 participants show that their mental engagement and enjoyment were significantly higher during the combined task.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Houston", "University of Houston", "Belmont University", "Athens State University", "University of Houston"], "authors": ["Dvijesh Shastri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shastri:Dvijesh", "Yuichi Fujiki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujiki:Yuichi", "Ross Buffington.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buffington:Ross", "Panagiotis Tsiamyrtzis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsiamyrtzis:Panagiotis", "Ioannis T.
