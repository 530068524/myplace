By committing to play a specific policy, the agent with the correct model can steer the behavior of the other agent, and seek to improve utility. We model this setting as a multi-view decision process, which we use to formally analyze the positive effect of steering policies. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm for computing the agents' achievable joint policy, and we experimentally show that it can lead to a large utility increase when the agents' models diverge.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Chalmers University of Technology", "Harvard University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Harvard University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Christos Dimitrakakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimitrakakis:Christos", "David C.
