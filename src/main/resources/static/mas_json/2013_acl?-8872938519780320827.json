{"title": "Modeling Thesis Clarity in Student Essays.", "fields": ["clarity", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Recently, researchers have begun exploring methods of scoring student essays with respect to particular dimensions of quality such as coherence, technical errors, and relevance to prompt, but there is relatively little work on modeling thesis clarity. We present a new annotated corpus and propose a learning-based approach to scoring essays along the thesis clarity dimension. Additionally, in order to provide more valuable feedback on why an essay is scored as it is, we propose a second learning-based approach to identifying what kinds of errors an essay has that may lower its thesis clarity score.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "Computer Science"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Isaac Persing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Persing:Isaac", "Vincent Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Vincent"], "pages": 10}
