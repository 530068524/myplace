In this article, we propose to use as an alternative the Fisher kernel framework. We first show why the Fisher representation is well-suited to the retrieval problem: it describes an image by what makes it different from other images. One drawback of the Fisher vector is that it is high-dimensional and, as opposed to the BOV, it is dense. The resulting memory and computational costs do not make Fisher vectors directly amenable to large-scale retrieval. Therefore, we compress Fisher vectors to reduce their memory footprint and speed-up the retrieval. We compare three binarization approaches: a simple approach devised for this representation and two standard compression techniques. We show on two publicly available datasets that compressed Fisher vectors perform very well using as little as a few hundreds of bits per image, and significantly better than a very recent compressed BOV approach.", "citation": "Citations (610)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Xerox", "Xerox", "Xerox", "Xerox"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Florent Perronnin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perronnin:Florent", "Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0017:Yan", "Jorge S\u00e1nchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=aacute=nchez:Jorge", "Herv\u00e9 Poirier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poirier:Herv=eacute="], "pages": 8}
