In the presence of a large volume of high dimensional data collected in a distributed fashion, it becomes very costly to communicate all of this data to a single data center and then perform kernel PCA. Can we perform kernel PCA on the entire dataset in a distributed and communication efficient fashion while maintaining provable and strong guarantees in solution quality?   In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to the question by developing a communication efficient algorithm to perform kernel PCA in the distributed setting. The algorithm is a clever combination of subspace embedding and adaptive sampling techniques, and we show that the algorithm can take as input an arbitrary configuration of distributed datasets, and compute a set of global kernel principal components with relative error guarantees independent of the dimension of the feature space or the total number of data points. In particular, computing  k  principal components with relative error e over  s  workers has communication cost O( spk /e+ sk  2 /e 3 ) words, where  p  is the average number of nonzero entries in each data point. Furthermore, we experimented the algorithm with large-scale real world datasets and showed that the algorithm produces a high quality kernel PCA solution while using significantly less communication than alternative approaches.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Princeton University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "IBM", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Maria-Florina Balcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balcan:Maria=Florina", "Yingyu Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Yingyu", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le", "David P.
