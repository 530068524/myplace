{"title": "Synthesizing Compound Words for Machine Translation.", "fields": ["transfer based machine translation", "phrase", "rule based machine translation", "classifier", "compound"], "abstract": "Most machine translation systems construct translations from a closed vocabulary of target word forms, posing problems for translating into languages that have productive compounding processes. We present a simple and effective approach that deals with this problem in two phases. First, we build a classifier that identifies spans of the input text that can be translated into a single compound word in the target language. Then, for each identified span, we generate a pool of possible compounds which are added to the translation model as \u201csynthetic\u201d phrase translations. Experiments reveal that (i) we can effectively predict what spans can be compounded; (ii) our compound generation model produces good compounds; and (iii) modest improvements are possible in end-to-end English\u2010German and English\u2010Finnish translation tasks. We additionally introduce KomposEval, a new multi-reference dataset of English phrases and their translations into German compounds.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Austin Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Austin", "Eva Schlinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlinger:Eva", "Alon Lavie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lavie:Alon", "Chris Dyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dyer:Chris"], "pages": -1}
