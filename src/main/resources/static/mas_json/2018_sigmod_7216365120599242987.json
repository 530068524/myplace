{"title": "A General and Efficient Querying Method for Learning to Hash.", "fields": ["ranking", "hamming distance", "hamming code", "hash function", "search problem"], "abstract": "As an effective solution to the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) search problem, learning to hash (L2H) is able to learn similarity-preserving hash functions tailored for a given dataset. However, existing L2H research mainly focuses on improving query performance by learning good hash functions, while Hamming ranking (HR) is used as the default querying method. We show by analysis and experiments that Hamming distance, the similarity indicator used in HR, is too coarse-grained and thus limits the performance of query processing. We propose a new fine-grained similarity indicator, quantization distance (QD), which provides more information about the similarity between a query and the items in a bucket. We then develop two efficient querying methods based on QD, which achieve significantly better query performance than HR. Our methods are general and can work with various L2H algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple and elegant querying method can produce performance gain equivalent to advanced and complicated learning algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jinfeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jinfeng", "Xiao Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Xiao", "Jian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jian", "An Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:An", "James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James", "Jie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jie", "Kelvin K.
