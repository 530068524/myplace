Besides providing multiple common and state of the art retrieval mechanisms it allows for easy use on multiple platforms. LIRe is actively used for research, teaching and commercial applications. Due to its modular nature it can be used on process level (e.g. index images and search) as well as on image feature level. Developers and researchers can easily extend and modify LIRe to adapt it to their needs.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "departments": ["Klagenfurt Univ ... enfurt, Austria"], "authors": ["Mathias Lux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lux:Mathias"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
