Our research studies the recommendation of social media content to leaders (owners) of online communities within the enterprise. We developed a system that suggests to owners new content from outside the community, which might interest the community members. As online communities are taking a central role in the pervasion of social media to the enterprise, sharing such recommendations can help owners create a more lively and engaging community. We compared seven different methods for generating recommendations, including content-based, member-based, and hybridization of the two. For member-based recommendations, we experimented with three groups: owners, active members, and regular members. Our evaluation is based on a survey in which 851 community owners rated a total of 8,218 recommended content items. We analyzed the quality of the different recommendation methods and examined the effect of different community characteristics, such as type and size.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["IBM", "Yahoo!", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "IBM"], "authors": ["Inbal Ronen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ronen:Inbal", "Ido Guy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guy:Ido", "Elad Kravi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kravi:Elad", "Maya Barnea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barnea:Maya"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
