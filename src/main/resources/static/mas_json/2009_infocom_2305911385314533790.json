A recent work has shown that PCA is very sensitive to calibration settings. Unfortunately, the authors did not provide further explanations for this observation. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide the reasoning behind the found discrepancies. We revisit PCA for anomaly detection and evaluate its performance on our data. We develop a slightly modified version of PCA that uses only data from a single router. Instead of correlating data across different spatial measurement points, we correlate the data across different metrics. With the help of the analyzed data, we explain the pitfalls of PCA and underline our argumentation with measurement results. We show that the main problem is that PCA fails to capture temporal correlation. We propose a solution to deal with this problem by replacing PCA with the Karhunen-Loeve transform. We find that when we consider temporal correlation, anomaly detection results are significantly improved.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Lancaster University", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Daniela Brauckhoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brauckhoff:Daniela", "Kav\u00e9 Salamatian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salamatian:Kav=eacute=", "Martin May.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/May:Martin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
