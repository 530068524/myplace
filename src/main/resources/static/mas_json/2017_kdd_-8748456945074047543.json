{"title": "Learning Certifiably Optimal Rule Lists.", "fields": ["categorical variable", "reuse", "discrete optimization", "certificate", "speedup"], "abstract": "We present the design and implementation of a custom discrete optimization technique for building rule lists over a categorical feature space. Our algorithm provides the optimal solution, with a certificate of optimality. By leveraging algorithmic bounds, efficient data structures, and computational reuse, we achieve several orders of magnitude speedup in time and a massive reduction of memory consumption. We demonstrate that our approach produces optimal rule lists on practical problems in seconds. This framework is a novel alternative to CART and other decision tree methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Elaine Angelino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angelino:Elaine", "Nicholas Larus-Stone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larus=Stone:Nicholas", "Daniel Alabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alabi:Daniel", "Margo Seltzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seltzer:Margo", "Cynthia Rudin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudin:Cynthia"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
