{"title": "1.x-Way architecture-implementation mapping.", "fields": ["space based architecture", "data architecture", "reference architecture", "software architecture", "enterprise architecture framework"], "abstract": "A new architecture-implementation mapping approach, 1.x-way mapping, is presented to address architecture-implementation conformance. It targets maintaining conformance of structure and behavior, providing a solution to architecture changes, and protecting architecture-prescribed code from being manually changed. Technologies developed in this work include deep separation of generated and non-generated code, an architecture change model, architecture-based code regeneration, and architecture change notification.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Yongjie Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yongjie"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
