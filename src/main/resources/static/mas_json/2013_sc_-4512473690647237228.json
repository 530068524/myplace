{"title": "Taking a quantum leap in time to solution for simulations of high-Tc superconductors.", "fields": ["quantum", "titan", "quantum simulator", "hubbard model", "quantum monte carlo"], "abstract": "We present a new quantum cluster algorithm to simulate models of high-Tc superconductors. This algorithm extends current methods with continuous lattice self-energies, thereby removing artificial long-range correlations. This cures the fermionic sign problem in the underlying quantum Monte Carlo solver for large clusters and realistic values of the Coulomb interaction in the entire temperature range of interest. We find that the new algorithm improves time-to-solution by nine orders of magnitude compared to current, state of the art quantum cluster simulations. An efficient implementation is given, which ports to multi-core as well as hybrid CPU-GPU systems. Running on 18,600 nodes on ORNL's Titan supercomputer enables us to compute a converged value of  T   c  / t  = 0.053 \u00b1 0.0014 for a 28 site cluster in the 2D Hubbard model with  U / t  = 7 at 10% hole doping. Typical simulations on Titan sustain between 9.2 and 15.4 petaflops (double precision measured over full run), depending on configuration and parameters used.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Peter Staar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Staar:Peter", "Thomas A.
