{"title": "Solving Existentially Quantified Horn Clauses.", "fields": ["unit propagation", "horn satisfiability", "ctl", "predicate abstraction", "horn clause"], "abstract": "Temporal verification of universal (i.e., valid for all computation paths) properties of various kinds of programs, e.g., procedural, multi-threaded, or functional, can be reduced to finding solutions for equations in form of universally quantified Horn clauses extended with well-foundedness conditions. Dealing with existential properties (e.g., whether there exists a particular computation path), however, requires solving forall-exists quantified Horn clauses, where the conclusion part of some clauses contains existentially quantified variables. For example, a deductive approach to CTL verification reduces to solving such clauses. In this paper we present a method for solving forall-exists quantified Horn clauses extended with well-foundedness conditions. Our method is based on a counterexample-guided abstraction refinement scheme to discover witnesses for existentially quantified variables. We also present an application of our solving method to automation of CTL verification of software, as well as its experimental evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Tewodros A.
