This paper puts forth  effectful comprehensions  as an elegant way to describe list comprehensions that incorporate loop-carried state. This is motivated by operations such as compression/decompression and serialization/deserialization that are common in log/data processing pipelines and require loop-carried state when processing an input stream of data.   We build on the underlying theory of  symbolic transducers  to fuse pipelines of effectful comprehensions into a single representation, from which efficient code can be generated. Using background theory reasoning with an SMT solver, our fusion and subsequent reachability based branch elimination algorithms can significantly reduce the complexity of the fused pipelines. Our implementation shows significant speedups over reasonable hand-written code (3.4\ufffd , on average) and traditionally fused version of the pipeline (2.6\ufffd , on average) for a variety of examples, including scenarios for extracting fields with regular expressions, processing XML with XPath, and running queries over encoded data.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Olli Saarikivi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saarikivi:Olli", "Margus Veanes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veanes:Margus", "Todd Mytkowicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mytkowicz:Todd", "Madan Musuvathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Musuvathi:Madan"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2017", "pages": 16}
