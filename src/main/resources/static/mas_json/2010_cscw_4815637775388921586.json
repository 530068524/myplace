We have developed an approach that tries to automatically create this semantic awareness based on developers' interactions with the programming environment, which is extended to log these interactions and allow the developers to train or supervise the algorithm by explicitly indicating they are having difficulty. Based on the logs of six programmers, we have found that our approach has high accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Jason Carter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carter:Jason", "Prasun Dewan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dewan:Prasun"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
