Feature interactions-- situations in which the combination of features leads to emergent and possibly critical behavior --are a major source of failures in software product lines. We explore how feature-aware verification can improve the automatic detection of feature interactions in software product lines. Feature-aware verification uses product-line-verification techniques and supports the specification of feature properties along with the features in separate and composable units. It integrates the technique of variability encoding to verify a product line without generating and checking a possibly exponential number of feature combinations. We developed the tool suite SPLVERIFIER for feature-aware verification, which is based on standard model-checking technology. We applied it to an e-mail system that incorporates domain knowledge of AT&T. We found that feature interactions can be detected automatically based on specifications that have only local knowledge.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "departments": ["University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau"], "authors": ["Sven Apel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apel:Sven", "Hendrik Speidel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Speidel:Hendrik", "Philipp Wendler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wendler:Philipp", "Alexander von Rhein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhein:Alexander_von", "Dirk Beyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beyer_0001:Dirk"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
