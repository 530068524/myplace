{"title": "Distributed, Modular HTL.", "fields": ["abstract syntax", "distributed control system", "program analysis", "modular design", "modular programming"], "abstract": "The Hierarchical Timing Language (HTL) is a real-time coordination language for distributed control systems. HTL programs must be checked for well-formedness, race freedom, transmission safety (schedulability of inter-host communication), and time safety (schedulability of host computation). We present a modular abstract syntax and semantics for HTL, modular checks of well-formedness, race freedom, and transmission safety, and modular code distribution. Our contributions here complement previous results on HTL time safety and modular code generation. Modularity in HTL can be utilized in easy program composition as well as fast program analysis and code generation, but also in so-called runtime patching, where program components may be modified at runtime.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University of Salzburg", "University of Porto", "University of Salzburg"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Thomas A.
