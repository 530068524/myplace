One approach is to use a vision-based approach. We quantify the 'preview effect' bias in visual mood assessment. We demonstrate that automated tools which infer user mood from photographs or video may be affected by the presentation methodology used while performing image capture. Specifically, we demonstrate that showing a \"preview\" of oneself,  i.e. , a mirror, increases the accuracy of the visual mood inference algorithms present in Google's Mobile Vision API. Our findings show that studies that incorporate visual mood assessment should include \"preview\" images to reduce bias and increase the reliability of vision-based happiness inference.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Oulu", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Zhanna Sarsenbayeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarsenbayeva:Zhanna", "Denzil Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Denzil", "Niels van Berkel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berkel:Niels_van", "Chu Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Chu", "Mikko Vaisanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaisanen:Mikko", "Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis", "Jorge Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Jorge"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
