Probabilistic Graphical Models are one of the primary methods for representing such dependencies. The structure of graphical models, however, is either determined heuristically or learned from very limited information. Moreover, neither of these approaches scales well to large or complex graphs. We propose a principled way to learn the structure of a graphical model by considering input features and labels, together with loss functions. We formulate this problem into a max-margin framework initially, and then transform it into a convex programming problem. Finally, we propose a highly scalable procedure that activates a set of cliques iteratively. Our approach exhibits both strong theoretical properties and a significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world data sets.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "Charles Sturt University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mingkui Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Mingkui", "Qinfeng Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Qinfeng", "Anton van den Hengel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hengel:Anton_van_den", "Chunhua Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chunhua", "Junbin Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Junbin", "Fuyuan Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Fuyuan", "Zhen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhen"], "pages": 10}
