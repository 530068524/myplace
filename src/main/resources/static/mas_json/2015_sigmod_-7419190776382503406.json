But the workloads available for this effort are often restrictive and non-representative of the ever changing requirements of the modern database applications. We recently introduced OLTP-Bench, an extensible testbed for benchmarking relational databases that is bundled with 15 workloads. The key features that set this framework apart is its ability to tightly control the request rate and dynamically change the transaction mixture. This allows an administrator to compose complex execution targets that recreate real system loads, and opens the doors to new research directions involving tuning for special execution patterns and multi-tenancy. In this demonstration, we highlight OLTP-Bench's important features through the BenchPress game. It allows users to control the benchmark behavior in real time for multiple database management systems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Fribourg", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "University of Fribourg"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Dana Van Aken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aken:Dana_Van", "Djellel Eddine Difallah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Difallah:Djellel_Eddine", "Andrew Pavlo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pavlo:Andrew", "Carlo Curino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curino:Carlo", "Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cudr=eacute==Mauroux:Philippe"], "pages": 5}
