{"title": "A practical approach to reconciling availability, performance, and capacity in provisioning extreme-scale storage systems.", "fields": ["data availability", "unavailability", "warrant", "spare part", "provisioning"], "abstract": "The increasing data demands from high-performance computing applications significantly accelerate the capacity, capability and reliability requirements of storage systems. As systems scale, component failures and repair times increase, significantly impacting data availability. A wide array of decision points must be balanced in designing such systems. We propose a systematic approach that balances and optimizes both initial and continuous spare provisioning based on a detailed investigation of the anatomy and field failure data analysis of extreme-scale storage systems. We consider the component failure characteristics and its cost and impact at the system level simultaneously. We build a tool to evaluate different provisioning schemes, and the results demonstrate that our optimized provisioning can reduce the duration of data unavailability by as much as 52% under a fixed budget. We also observe that non-disk components have much higher failure rates than disks, and warrant careful considerations in the overall provisioning process.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Lipeng Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Lipeng", "Feiyi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Feiyi", "Sarp Oral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oral:Sarp", "Devesh Tiwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwari:Devesh", "Sudharshan S.
