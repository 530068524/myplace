Since many compounds have not been observed during training, they pose a challenge for translation systems. Previous decompounding methods have often been restricted to a small set of languages as they cannot deal with more complex compound forming processes. We present a novel and unsupervised method to learn the compound parts and morphological operations needed to split compounds into their compound parts. The method uses a bilingual corpus to learn the morphological operations required to split a compound into its parts. Furthermore, monolingual corpora are used to learn and filter the set of compound part candidates. We evaluate our method within a machine translation task and show significant improvements for various languages to show the versatility of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Google", "University of Edinburgh", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Klaus Macherey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Macherey:Klaus", "Andrew M.
