This is becoming a need in the evolving internet-based era where web-based applications are very common and the number of users accessing structured databases is increasing rapidly. Restricting the user group to only experts in query coding must be avoided. The Ask Fuzzy system has been developed to address this vital issue which has social and industrial impact. It is an attractive and friendly visual user interface that facilitates expressing queries using both fuzziness and traditional methods. The fuzziness is not expressed explicitly inside the database, it is rather absorbed and effectively handled by an intermediate layer which is cleverly incorporated between the front-end visual user-interface and the back-end database.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Western Ontario", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Keivan Kianmehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kianmehr:Keivan", "Negar Koochakzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koochakzadeh:Negar", "Reda Alhajj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alhajj:Reda"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
