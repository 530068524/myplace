The technique has been recently extended with probabilistic reasoning. This approach computes the conditions to reach target program events of interest and uses model counting to quantify the fraction of the input domain satisfying these conditions thus computing the probability of event occurrence. This probabilistic information can be used for example to compute the reliability of an aircraft controller under different wind conditions (modeled probabilistically) or to quantify the leakage of sensitive data in a software system, using information theory metrics such as Shannon entropy. In this talk we review recent advances in symbolic execution and probabilistic reasoning and we discuss how they can be used to ensure the safety and security of software systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Corina S.
