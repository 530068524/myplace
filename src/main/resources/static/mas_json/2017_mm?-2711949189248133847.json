{"title": "RGB-D Scene Recognition with Object-to-Object Relation.", "fields": ["scene statistics", "semantic gap", "semantic feature", "convolutional neural network", "rgb color model"], "abstract": "A scene is usually abstract that consists of several less abstract entities such as objects or themes. It is very difficult to reason scenes from visual features due to the semantic gap between the abstract scenes and low-level visual features. Some alternative works recognize scenes with a two-step framework by representing images with intermediate representations of objects or themes. However, the object co-occurrences between scenes may lead to ambiguity for scene recognition. In this paper, we propose a framework to represent images with intermediate (object) representations with spatial layout, i.e., object-to-object relation (OOR) representation. In order to better capture the spatial information, the proposed OOR is adapted to RGB-D data. In the proposed framework, we first apply object detection technique on RGB and depth images separately. Then the detected results of both modalities are combined with a RGB-D proposal fusion process. Based on the detected results, we extract semantic feature OOR and regional convolutional neural network (CNN) features located by bounding boxes. Finally, different features are concatenated to feed to the classifier for scene recognition. The experimental results on SUN RGB-D and NYUD2 datasets illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Xinhang Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Xinhang", "Chengpeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chengpeng", "Shuqiang Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Shuqiang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
