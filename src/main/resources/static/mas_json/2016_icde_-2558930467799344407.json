{"title": "QB2OLAP: Enabling OLAP on Statistical Linked Open Data.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "online analytical processing", "rdf schema", "sparql", "linked data"], "abstract": "Publication and sharing of multidimensional (MD) data on the Semantic Web (SW) opens new opportunities for the use of On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). The RDF Data Cube (QB) vocabulary, the current standard for statistical data publishing, however, lacks key MD concepts such as dimension hierarchies and aggregate functions. QB4OLAP was proposed to remedy this. However, QB4OLAP requires extensive manual annotation and users must still write queries in SPARQL, the standard query language for RDF, which typical OLAP users are not familiar with. In this demo, we present QB2OLAP, a tool for enabling OLAP on existing QB data. Without requiring any RDF, QB(4OLAP), or SPARQL skills, it allows semi-automatic transformation of a QB data set into a QB4OLAP one via enrichment with QB4OLAP semantics, exploration of the enriched schema, and querying with the high-level OLAP language QL that exploits the QB4OLAP semantics and is automatically translated to SPARQL.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Buenos Aires", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Aalborg University", "Instituto de Co ... evideo, Uruguay"], "authors": ["Jovan Varga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varga:Jovan", "Lorena Etcheverry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etcheverry:Lorena", "Alejandro A.
