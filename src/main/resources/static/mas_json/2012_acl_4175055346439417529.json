{"title": "Bootstrapping a Unified Model of Lexical and Phonetic Acquisition.", "fields": ["cohort model", "pronunciation", "lexicon", "lexical item", "lexical functional grammar"], "abstract": "During early language acquisition, infants must learn both a lexicon and a model of phonetics that explains how lexical items can vary in pronunciation---for instance \"the\" might be realized as [\u00f0i] or [\u00f0\u0259]. Previous models of acquisition have generally tackled these problems in isolation, yet behavioral evidence suggests infants acquire lexical and phonetic knowledge simultaneously. We present a Bayesian model that clusters together phonetic variants of the same lexical item while learning both a language model over lexical items and a log-linear model of pronunciation variability based on articulatory features. The model is trained on transcribed surface pronunciations, and learns by bootstrapping, without access to the true lexicon. We test the model using a corpus of child-directed speech with realistic phonetic variation and either gold standard or automatically induced word boundaries. In both cases modeling variability improves the accuracy of the learned lexicon over a system that assumes each lexical item has a unique pronunciation.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Micha Elsner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elsner:Micha", "Sharon Goldwater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldwater:Sharon", "Jacob Eisenstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisenstein:Jacob"], "pages": 10}
