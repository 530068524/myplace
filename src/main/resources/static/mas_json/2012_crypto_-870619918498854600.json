This gap is both quantitative, because these counterparts are more efficient than PRF in various ways, and methodological, because these counterparts usually fit in the substitution-permutation network paradigm (SPN), which has not been used to construct PRF.   We give several candidate PRF  F i   that are inspired by the SPN paradigm. Most of our candidates are more efficient than previous ones. Our main candidates are as follows.   \u2014 F  1  : {0,1}  n   \u2192 {0,1}  n   is an SPN whose S-box is a random function on  b  bits given as part of the seed. We prove that  F  1  resists attacks that run in time \u2264 2  eb  .   \u2014 F  2  : {0,1}  n   \u2192 {0,1}  n   is an SPN where the S-box is (patched) field inversion, a common choice in practical constructions. We show that  F  2  is computable with boolean circuits of size  n  \u1e61 log  O (1)   n  and that it has exponential security 2 \u03a9( n )  against linear and differential cryptanalysis.   \u2014 F  3  : {0,1}  n   \u2192 {0,1} is a nonstandard variant on the SPN paradigm, where \u201cstates\u201d grow in length. We show that  F  3  is computable with TC 0  circuits of size  n  1 p e , for any e > 0, and that it is almost 3-wise independent.   \u2014 F  4  : {0,1}  n   \u2192 {0,1} uses an extreme setting of the SPN parameters (one round, one S-box, no diffusion matrix). The S-box is again (patched) field inversion. We show that  F  4  is computable by circuits of size  n  \u1e61 log  O (1)   n  and that it fools all parity tests on \u22642 0.9 n   outputs.   Assuming the security of our candidates, our work narrows the gap between the Natural Proofs barrier and existing lower bounds in three models: circuits, TC 0  circuits, and Turing machines.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Eric Miles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miles:Eric", "Emanuele Viola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viola:Emanuele"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 18}
