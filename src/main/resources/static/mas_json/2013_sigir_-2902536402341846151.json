{"title": "Faster upper bounding of intersection sizes.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "cardinality", "intersection", "finite set", "performance studies"], "abstract": "There is a long history of developing efficient algorithms for set intersection, which is a fundamental operation in information retrieval and databases. In this paper, we describe a new data structure, a  Cardinality Filter , to quickly compute an  upper bound  on the size of a set intersection. Knowing an upper bound of the size can be used to accelerate many applications such as top- k  query processing in text mining. Given finite sets  A  and  B , the expected computation time for the upper bound of the size of the intersection | A  cap  B | is  O ( (| A | + | B |)  w ), where  w  is the machine word length. This is much faster than the current best algorithm for the  exact  intersection, which runs in  O ((| A | + | B |) / \u221a w  + | A  cap  B |) expected time. Our performance studies show that our implementations of Cardinality Filters are from 2 to 10 times faster than existing set intersection algorithms, and the time for a top- k  query in a text mining application can be reduced by half.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Daisuke Takuma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takuma:Daisuke", "Hiroki Yanagisawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yanagisawa:Hiroki"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
