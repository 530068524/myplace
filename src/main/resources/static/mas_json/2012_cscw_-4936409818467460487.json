We deployed the Meeting Mediator, a real-time sociometric feedback system to groups participating in two rounds of a social dilemma task: in one round, all members were co-located and in the other round, the members were geographically distributed. Laboratory results show that the sociometric feedback successfully increases the speaking time and the frequency of turn transitions of groups that are initially distributed and later co-located, and also leads to a higher cooperation rate, increasing the overall earnings of these groups. In addition, the sociometric feedback helps groups have a more consistent pattern of behavior before and after a change in their geographic distribution.   Therefore, the sociometric feedback influences the communication patterns of distributed groups and makes them more cooperative. Furthermore, the sociometric feedback helps groups sustain those patterns of communication even after a change in geographic distribution.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Accenture", "Stanford University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Alex Pentland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pentland:Alex", "Pamela Hinds.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hinds:Pamela", "Taemie Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Taemie"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
