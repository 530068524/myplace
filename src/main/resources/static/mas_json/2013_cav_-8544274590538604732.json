In [6] Bustan and Havlicek show that the local variable extensions, as well as regular expressions with intersection, render the verification problem of SVA and PSL formulae EXPSPACE-complete. In this paper we show a practical approach for the verification problem of SVA and PSL with local variables. We show that in practice, for a significant and meaningful subsets of those languages, which we denote PSL pract , local variables do not increase the complexity of their verification problem, keeping it in PSPACE.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Synopsys", "Synopsys", "Synopsys"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Roy Armoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Armoni:Roy", "Dana Fisman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fisman:Dana", "Naiyong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Naiyong"], "pages": 16}
