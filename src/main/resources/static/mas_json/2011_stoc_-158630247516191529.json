{"title": "Near-optimal distortion bounds for embedding doubling spaces into L", "fields": ["rounding", "binary logarithm", "arbitrarily large", "log log plot", "embedding"], "abstract": "We exhibit an infinite doubling metric space (X,d) such that for any non-expansive f : X -> L 1 , there exists a pair x,y \u2208 X with d(x,y) arbitrarily large, and such that |f(x)-f(y)\\| 1 /d(x,y) \u2272 \u221alog log d(x,y)}/(log d(x,y)).   As a consequence, we show that there are n-point doubling metrics which require distortion \u03a9(\u221a{log n/(log log n)}) into L 1 , matching the upper bound of [Gupta-Krauthgamer-Lee, FOCS'03] up to a factor of O(\u221alog log n). The best previous lower bound for doubling spaces, due to [Cheeger-Kleiner-Naor, FOCS'09] was of the form (log n) \u03b4  for some small, unspecified value of \u03b4 > 0.   Furthermore, this gives a nearly optimal integrality gap for a weak version of the SDP for the general Sparsest Cut Problem. The weak SDP suffices for all known rounding algorithms, and the best previous gap was of the order (log n) 1/4 /(log log n) [Lee-Moharrami, STOC'10].", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Toyota"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["James R.
