A common trait in many recently investigated cognitive-like tasks is that they take into account different data modalities, such as visual and textual input. In this paper we propose a novel and generally applicable form of attention mechanism that learns high-order correlations between various data modalities. We show that high-order correlations effectively direct the appropriate attention to the relevant elements in the different data modalities that are required to solve the joint task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our high-order attention mechanism on the task of visual question answering (VQA), where we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard VQA dataset.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Idan Schwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwartz:Idan", "Alexander G.
