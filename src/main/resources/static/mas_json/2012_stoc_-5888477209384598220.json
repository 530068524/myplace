In particular, we show that there are formulas of size N that have Resolution refutations of space and size each roughly N log 2  N  (and like all formulas have Resolution refutations of space N) for which any Resolution refutation using space S and length T requires T \u2265 (N 0.58 log 2  N /S) \u03a9(log log N/log log log N) . By downward translation, a similar tradeoff applies to all smaller space bounds.   We also show somewhat stronger time-space tradeoff lower bounds for Regular Resolution, which are also the first to apply to superlinear space. Namely, for any space bound S at most 2 o(N 1/4 )  there are formulas of size $N$, having clauses of width 4, that have Regular Resolution proofs of space S and slightly larger size T=O(NS), but for which any Regular Resolution proof of space S 1-e  requires length T \u03a9(log log N/ log log log N) .", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Princeton University", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Paul Beame.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beame:Paul", "Christopher Beck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beck:Christopher", "Russell Impagliazzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Impagliazzo:Russell"], "pages": 20}
