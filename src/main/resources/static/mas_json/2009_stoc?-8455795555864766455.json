Our main results are: To represent n ternary values t \u2208 {0,1,2} n  in terms of u bits b \u2208 {0,1} u  while accessing a single value t i  \u2208 {0,1,2} by probing q bits of b, one needs u \u2265 (log 2  3)n + n/2 O(q) . This matches an exciting representation by Patrascu (FOCS 2008), later refined with Thorup, where u \u2264 (log_2 3)n + n/2 \u03a9(q) . We also note that results on logarithmic forms imply the lower bound u \u2265 (log 2  3)n + n/log O(1)  n if we access t i  by probing one cell of log n bits. To represent sets of size n/3 from a universe of n elements in terms of u bits b \u2208 {0,1} u  while answering membership queries by probing q bits of b, one needs u \u2265 log 2  n/(n/3) + n/2 O(q)  - log n. Both results above hold even if the probe locations are determined adaptively. Ours are the first lower bounds for these fundamental problems; we obtain them drawing on ideas used in lower bounds for locally decodable codes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Emanuele Viola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viola:Emanuele"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
