{"title": "On the Computational Complexity of Verifying One-Counter Processes.", "fields": ["directed acyclic graph", "presburger arithmetic", "model checking", "singleton", "bisimulation"], "abstract": "One-counter processes are pushdown systems over a singleton stack alphabet (plus a stack-bottom symbol). We study the complexity of two closely related verification problems over one-counter processes: model checking with the temporal logic EF, where formulas are given as directed acyclic graphs, and weak bisimilarity checking against finite systems. We show that both problems are $\\P^\\NP$-complete. This is achieved by establishing a close correspondence with the membership problem for a natural fragment of Presburger Arithmetic, which we show to be$\\P^\\NP$-complete. This fragment is also a suitable representation for the global versions of the problems. We also show that there already exists a fixed EF formula(resp. a fixed finite system) such that model checking (resp. weak bisimulation) over one-counter processes is hard for $\\P^{\\NP[\\log]}$. However, the complexity drops to $\\P$ if the one-counter process is fixed.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Edinburgh", "School of Infor ... omputer Science"], "authors": ["Stefan G\u00f6ller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml=ller:Stefan", "Richard Mayr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayr:Richard", "Anthony Widjaja To.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/To:Anthony_Widjaja"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
