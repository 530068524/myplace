Since several of the technologies underlying rule-based systems are already quite mature, it is important to understand how such systems might perform on the Web scale. OpenRuleBench is a suite of benchmarks for analyzing the performance and scalability of different rule engines. Currently the study spans five different technologies and eleven systems, but OpenRuleBench is an open community resource, and contributions from the community are welcome. In this paper, we describe the tested systems and technologies, the methodology used in testing, and analyze the results.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Senlin Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Senlin", "Paul Fodor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fodor:Paul", "Hui Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Hui", "Michael Kifer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kifer:Michael"], "conf": "www", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
