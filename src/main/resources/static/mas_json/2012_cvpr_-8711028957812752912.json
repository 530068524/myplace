An algorithm provides us with pairwise image similarities. We then actively obtain selected, more accurate pairwise similarities from humans. A novel method is developed to choose the most useful pairs to show a person, obtaining constraints that improve clustering. In a clustering assignment elements in each data pair are either in the same cluster or in different clusters. We simulate inverting these pairwise relations and see how that affects the overall clustering. We choose a pair that maximizes the expected change in the clustering. The proposed algorithm has high time complexity, so we also propose a version of this algorithm that is much faster and exactly replicates our original algorithm. We further improve run-time by adding heuristics, and show that these do not significantly impact the effectiveness of our method. We have run experiments in two different domains, namely leaf images and face images, and show that clustering performance can be improved significantly.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Arijit Biswas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biswas:Arijit", "David W.
