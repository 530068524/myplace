To this end, we developed FamiLync, a mobile service that treats  use-limiting  as a family activity and provides the family with a virtual public space to foster social awareness and improve self-regulation. A three-week user study conducted with twelve families in Korea (17 parents and 18 teenagers) showed that FamiLync improves mutual understanding of usage behavior, thereby providing common grounds for parental mediation. Further, parents actively participated in use-limiting with their children, which significantly increased the children's desire to participate. As a consequence, parental mediation methods and parent-child interaction in relation to smartphone usage changed appreciably, and the participants smartphone usage amount significantly decreased.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Naver Corp"], "authors": ["Minsam Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko:Minsam", "Seung-Woo Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Seung=Woo", "Subin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Subin", "Joonwon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joonwon", "Uichin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Uichin"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
