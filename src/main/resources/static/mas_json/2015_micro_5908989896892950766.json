{"title": "Exploiting commutativity to reduce the cost of updates to shared data in cache-coherent systems.", "fields": ["commutative property", "exploit", "cache coherence", "cpu cache", "bitwise operation"], "abstract": "We present C oup , a technique to lower the cost of updates to shared data in cache-coherent systems. C oup  exploits the insight that many update operations, such as additions and bitwise logical operations, are  commutative : they produce the same final result regardless of the order they are performed in. C oup  allows multiple private caches to simultaneously hold  update-only  permission to the same cache line. Caches with update-only permission can locally buffer and coalesce updates to the line, but cannot satisfy read requests. Upon a read request, C oup   reduces  the partial updates buffered in private caches to produce the final value. C oup  integrates seamlessly into existing coherence protocols, requires inexpensive hardware, and does not affect the memory consistency model.   We apply C oup  to speed up single-word updates to shared data. On a simulated 128-core, 8-socket system, C oup  accelerates state-of-the-art implementations of update-heavy algorithms by up to 2.4\u00d7.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Guowei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Guowei", "Webb Horn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horn:Webb", "Daniel S\u00e1nchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=aacute=nchez_0003:Daniel"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
