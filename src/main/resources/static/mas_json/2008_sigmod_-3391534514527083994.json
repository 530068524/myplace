{"title": "Effective and efficient semantic web data management over DB2.", "fields": ["cwm", "rdf schema", "rdf xml", "social semantic web", "semantic analytics"], "abstract": "With the fast growth of Semantic Web, more and more RDF data and ontologies are created and widely used in Web applications and enterprise information systems. It is reported that the W3C Linking Open Data community project consists of over two billion RDF triples, which are interlinked by about three million RDF links. Recently, efficient RDF data management on top of relational databases gains particular attentions from both Semantic Web community and database community. In this paper, we present effective and efficient Semantic Web data management over DB2, including efficient schema and indexes design for storage, practical ontology reasoning support, and an effective SPARQL-to-SQL translation method for RDF query. Moreover, we show the performance and scalability of our system by an evaluation among well-known RDF stores and discuss future work.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Li Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma_0002:Li", "Chen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0020:Chen", "Jing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jing", "Feng Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Feng", "Yue Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Yue", "Yong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yong"], "pages": 12}
