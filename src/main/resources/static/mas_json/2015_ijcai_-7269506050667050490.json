In this work, we propose a new efficient algorithm that is guided by correction sets and cores. At every iteration, the algorithm obtains a correction set or a core, which is then used to rewrite the formula using incremental and succinct transformations. We theoretically show that correction sets and cores have complementary strengths and empirically demonstrate that their combination leads to an efficient MAXSAT solver that outperforms state-of-the-art WPMS solvers on the 2014 Evaluation on industrial instances.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Nikolaj Bj\u00f8rner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bj=oslash=rner:Nikolaj", "Nina Narodytska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narodytska:Nina"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
