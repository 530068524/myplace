{"title": "A Poisson Regression Method for Top-N Recommendation.", "fields": ["recommender system", "machine learning", "data mining", "poisson regression", "covariance matrix"], "abstract": "Top-N recommendation tasks aim to solve the information overload problem for users in the information age. As a user's decision may be affected by correlations among items, we incorporate such correlations with the user and item latent factors to propose a Poisson-regression-based method for top-N recommendation tasks. By placing priori knowledge and using a sparse structure assumption, this method learns the latent factors and the structure of the item-item correlation matrix through the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The preliminary experimental results on two real-world datasets show the improved performance of our approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Beijing University of Technology", "Beijing University of Technology", "Maebashi Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jiajin Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jiajin", "Jian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jian", "Ning Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong_0001:Ning"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
