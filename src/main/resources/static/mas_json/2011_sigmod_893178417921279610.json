In this paper, we demonstrate DSToolkit, a system that allows users to provide feedback on results of queries posed over an integration schema. Such feedback is then used to annotate the mappings with their respective precision and recall. The system then allows a user to state the expected levels of precision (or recall) that the query results should exhibit and, in order to produce those results, the system selects those mappings that are predicted to meet the stated constraints.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "University of Manchester"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Cornelia Hedeler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hedeler:Cornelia", "Khalid Belhajjame.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belhajjame:Khalid", "Norman W.
