After motivating and introducing the framework of rational verification, we present formal models through which rational verification can be studied, and survey the complexity of key decision problems. We give an overview of a prototype software tool for rational verification, and conclude with a discussion and related work.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Michael Wooldridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wooldridge:Michael", "Julian Gutierrez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gutierrez_0001:Julian", "Paul Harrenstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrenstein:Paul", "Enrico Marchioni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marchioni:Enrico", "Giuseppe Perelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perelli:Giuseppe", "Alexis Toumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toumi:Alexis"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
