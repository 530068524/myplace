{"title": "Compact Snippet Caching for Flash-based Search Engines.", "fields": ["snippet", "cache", "dynamic random access memory", "solid state drive", "effective method"], "abstract": "In response to a user query, search engines return the top-k relevant results, each of which contains a small piece of text, called a snippet, extracted from the corresponding document. Obtaining a snippet is time consuming as it requires both document retrieval (disk access) and string matching (CPU computation), so caching of snippets is used to reduce latency. With the trend of using flash-based solid state drives (SSDs) instead of hard disk drives for search engine storage, the bottleneck of snippet generation shifts from I/O to computation. We propose a simple, but effective method for exploiting this trend, which we call fragment caching: instead of caching the whole snippet, we only cache snippet metadata which describe how to retrieve the snippet from the document. While this approach increases I/O time, the cost is insignificant on SSDs. The major benefit of fragment caching is the ability to cache the same snippets (without loss of quality) while only using a fraction of the memory the traditional method requires. In our experiments, we find around 10 times less memory is required to achieve comparable snippet generation times for dynamic memory, and we consistently achieve a vastly greater hit ratio for static caching.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nankai University", "Nankai University", "Nankai University", "Nankai University", "Nankai University"], "authors": ["Rui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Rui", "Pengyu Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Pengyu", "Jiancong Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Jiancong", "Rebecca Jane Stones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stones:Rebecca_Jane", "Gang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Gang", "Xiaoguang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaoguang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
