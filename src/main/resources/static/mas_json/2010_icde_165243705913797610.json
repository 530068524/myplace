Traditional online analytical processing (OLAP) systems are not designed for real-time pattern-based operations, while Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems are designed for sequence detection and do not support OLAP operations. We will demonstrate a novel E-Cube model that combines CEP and OLAP techniques for multi-dimensional event pattern analysis at different abstraction levels. A London transit scenario will be given to demonstrate the utility and performance of this proposed technology.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Mo Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Mo", "Elke A.
