{"title": "CUR from a Sparse Optimization Viewpoint.", "fields": ["sparse approximation", "sparse pca", "convex optimization", "randomized algorithm", "matrix"], "abstract": "The CUR decomposition provides an approximation of a matrix X that has low reconstruction error and that is sparse in the sense that the resulting approximation lies in the span of only a few columns of X. In this regard, it appears to be similar to many sparse PCA methods. However, CUR takes a randomized algorithmic approach, whereas most sparse PCA methods are framed as convex optimization problems. In this paper, we try to understand CUR from a sparse optimization viewpoint. We show that CUR is implicitly optimizing a sparse regression objective and, furthermore, cannot be directly cast as a sparse PCA method. We also observe that the sparsity attained by CUR possesses an interesting structure, which leads us to formulate a sparse PCA method that achieves a CUR-like sparsity.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Jacob Bien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bien:Jacob", "Ya Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ya", "Michael W.
