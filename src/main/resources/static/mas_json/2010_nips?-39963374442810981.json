Because the conditional independencies between different nodes correspond to zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution, one can learn the structure of the graph by estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix from sample data, by solving a convex maximum likelihood problem with an l1-regularization term. In this paper, we propose a first-order method based on an alternating linearization technique that exploits the problem's special structure; in particular, the subproblems solved in each iteration have closed-form solutions. Moreover, our algorithm obtains an e-optimal solution in O(1/e) iterations. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data from gene association networks show that a practical version of this algorithm outperforms other competitive algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (159)", "departments": ["Lehigh University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Katya Scheinberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheinberg:Katya", "Shiqian Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shiqian", "Donald Goldfarb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldfarb:Donald"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
