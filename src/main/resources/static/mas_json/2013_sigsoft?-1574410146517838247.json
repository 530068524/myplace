{"title": "Compiling mockups to flexible UIs.", "fields": ["design education", "communication design", "mockup", "web design", "web modeling"], "abstract": "As the web becomes ubiquitous, developers are obliged to develop web applications for a variety of desktop and mobile platforms. Re- designing the user interface for every such platform is clearly cumbersome. We propose a new framework based on model-based compilation to assist the designer in solving this problem. Starting from an under-specified visual design mockup drawn by the designer, we show how faithful and flexible web pages can be obtained with virtually no manual effort. Our framework, in sharp contrast to existing web design tools, overcomes the tough challenges involved in mockup compilation by (a) employing combinatorial search to infer hierarchical layouts and (b) mechanizing adhoc principles for CSS design into a modular, extensible rule-based architecture. We believe ours is the first disciplined effort to solve the problem and will inspire rapid, low-effort web design.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["IBM", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Nishant Sinha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinha_0001:Nishant", "Rezwana Karim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karim:Rezwana"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 11}
