This shows that a communication protocol cannot always be compressed to its internal information. By a result of Braverman [1], our gap is the largest possible. By a result of Braverman and Rao [2], our example shows a gap between communication complexity and amortized communication complexity, implying that a tight direct sum result for distributional communication complexity cannot hold.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Anat Ganor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganor:Anat", "Gillat Kol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kol:Gillat", "Ran Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Ran"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
