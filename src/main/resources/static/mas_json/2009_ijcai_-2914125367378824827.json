However, the existence of multiple people involved in multiple dialogues presents special challenges. To model the conversational dynamics of concurrent chatting behaviors, this article advocates Factorial Conditional Random Fields (FCRFs) as a model to accommodate co-temporal relationships among multiple activity states. In addition, to avoid the use of inefficient Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) algorithm, we propose using Iterative Classification Algorithm (ICA) as the inference method for FCRFs. We designed experiments to compare our FCRFs model with two dynamic probabilistic models, Parallel Condition Random Fields (PCRFs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), in learning and decoding based on auditory data. The experimental results show that FCRFs outperform PCRFs and HMMs-like models. We also discover that FCRFs using the ICA inference approach not only improves the recognition accuracy but also takes significantly less time than the LBP inference method.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Chia-chun Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Chia=chun", "Jane Yung-jen Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Jane_Yung=jen"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
