In this paper, we ask what happens if a given profile admits several such voters. We model strategic interactions among Gibbard-Satterthwaite manipulators as a normal-form game. We classify the 2-by-2 games that can arise in this setting for two simple voting rules, namely Plurality and Borda, and study the complexity of determining whether a given manipulative vote weakly dominates truth-telling, as well as existence of Nash equilibria.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Toulouse", "University of Padua", "University of Auckland"], "authors": ["Edith Elkind.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkind:Edith", "Umberto Grandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grandi:Umberto", "Francesca Rossi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossi:Francesca", "Arkadii Slinko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slinko:Arkadii"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
