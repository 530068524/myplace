To reduce the impact of the curse of high dimensionality, we incorporate a dimensionality reduction method, Locality Preserving Projection (LPP), into the recommendation model. A joint learning model is proposed to achieve the task of dimensionality reduction and recommendation simultaneously and iteratively. Specifically, item similarities generated by the recommendation model are used as the weights of the adjacency graph for LPP while the projections are used to bias the learning of item similarity. Employing LPP for recommendation not only preserves locality but also improves item similarity. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed method is superior over state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Yifan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yifan", "Xiang Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0002:Xiang", "Maarten de Rijke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rijke:Maarten_de"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
