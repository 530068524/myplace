{"title": "Winterscape and ambient video: an intermedia border zone.", "fields": ["poetics", "post production", "video art", "intermedia", "fine art photography"], "abstract": "\"Ambient Video\" is an emergent media form that operates in an intermedia border zone, sharing the aesthetics of cinema, video, painting, and fine art photography. Winterscape is an ambient video work that incorporates these directions. Like any ambient work, Winterscape must reward, but never require, viewer attention. It must also retain its visual interest over repeated viewings. In order to meet this aesthetic challenge, Winterscape relies on three artistic strategies: strong visual form and composition, manipulation of cinematic time, and deep manipulation of image and transition. At the same time it vests control over interaction with the viewer.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Jim Bizzocchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bizzocchi:Jim"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
