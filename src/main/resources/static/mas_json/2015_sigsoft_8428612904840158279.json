In this paper, we propose a novel capability inference mechanism for libraries written in Java. It uses a coarse-grained capability model for system resources that can be presented to developers. We found that the capability inference agrees by 86.81% on expectations towards capabilities that can be derived from project documentation. Moreover, our approach can find capabilities that cannot be discovered using project documentation. It is thus a helpful tool for developers mitigating the aforementioned dilemma.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Ben Hermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hermann:Ben", "Michael Reif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reif:Michael", "Michael Eichberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eichberg:Michael", "Mira Mezini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mezini:Mira"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
