However, in our point of view, construction of a simple voxel model is relatively easy because it can be built with blocks. Even small children can build a voxel model. We present a method to convert a voxel model into a free-form surface model in order to facilitate construction of surface models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Kazutaka Nakashima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakashima:Kazutaka", "Takeo Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Takeo"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
