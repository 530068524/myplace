However, convergence issues and difficulties dealing with discrete data hinder the applicability of GAN to text. We propose a framework for generating realistic text via adversarial training. We employ a long short-term memory network as generator, and a convolutional network as discriminator. Instead of using the standard objective of GAN, we propose matching the high-dimensional latent feature distributions of real and synthetic sentences, via a kernelized discrepancy metric. This eases adversarial training by alleviating the mode-collapsing problem. Our experiments show superior performance in quantitative evaluation, and demonstrate that our model can generate realistic-looking sentences.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yizhe Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yizhe", "Zhe Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Zhe", "Kai Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Kai", "Zhi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhi", "Ricardo Henao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henao:Ricardo", "Dinghan Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Dinghan", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "pages": 10}
