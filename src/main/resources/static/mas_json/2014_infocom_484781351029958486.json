This is a promising solution for addressing users' increasing needs for ubiquitous connectivity and allevi- ating network congestion. The success of such services heavily depends on users' willingness to contribute their resources. In this paper, we consider a general model for such services, and design a distributed incentive mechanism for encouraging users' participation. This bargaining based scheme ensures that the contribution of user resources, in terms of Internet access bandwidths and battery energy, and the allocation of service capacity, measured in the delivered mobile data, are Pareto efficient and proportionally fair. The numerical results verify that the service always improves users' performance and that these benefits depend on the diversity of the users' resources.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["University of Thessaly", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Thessaly"], "authors": ["George Iosifidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iosifidis:George", "Lin Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Lin", "Jianwei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jianwei", "Leandros Tassiulas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tassiulas:Leandros"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
