We leverage recent advances of deep convolutional neural networks to generate an ordered high-level sequence from a whole word image, avoiding the difficult character segmentation problem. Then a deep recurrent model, building on long short-term memory (LSTM), is developed to robustly recognize the generated CNN sequences, departing from most existing approaches recognising each character independently. Our model has a number of appealing properties in comparison to existing scene text recognition methods: (i) It can recognise highly ambiguous words by leveraging meaningful context information, allowing it to work reliably without either pre- or post-processing; (ii) the deep CNN feature is robust to various image distortions; (iii) it retains the explicit order information in word image, which is essential to discriminate word strings; (iv) the model does not depend on pre-defined dictionary, and it can process unknown words and arbitrary strings. It achieves impressive results on several benchmarks, advancing the-state-of-the-art substantially.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Pan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Pan", "Weilin Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Weilin", "Yu Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao_0001:Yu", "Chen Change Loy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loy:Chen_Change", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
