Pre-processing data, calculating metrics, and synthesizing composite results from a large corpus of project artefacts is a tedious and error prone task lacking direct scientific value. The Alitheia Core tool is an extensible platform for software quality analysis that is designed specifically to facilitate software engineering research on large and diverse data sources, by integrating data collection and preprocessing phases with an array of analysis services, and presenting the researcher with an easy to use extension mechanism. The system has been used to process several projects successfully, forming the basis of an emerging ecosystem of quality analysis tools.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Athens University of Economics and Business", "Athens University of Economics and Business"], "authors": ["Georgios Gousios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gousios:Georgios", "Diomidis Spinellis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spinellis:Diomidis"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
