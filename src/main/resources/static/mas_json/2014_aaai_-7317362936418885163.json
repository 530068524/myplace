{"title": "User Group Oriented Temporal Dynamics Exploration.", "fields": ["zeitgeist", "machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "statistical model"], "abstract": "Temporal online content becomes the zeitgeist to reflect our interests and changes. Active users are essential participants and promoters behind it. Temporal dynamics becomes a viable way to investigate users. However, most current work only use global temporal trend and fail to distinguish such fine-grained patterns across groups. Different users have diverse interest and exhibit distinct behaviors, and temporal dynamics tend to be different.\n\nThis paper proposes GrosToT (Group Specific Topics-over-Time), a unified probabilistic model to infer latent user groups and temporal topics at the same time. It models group-specific temporal topic variation from social content. By leveraging the comprehensive group-specific temporal patterns, Gros-ToT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art dynamics modeling methods. Our proposed approach shows advantage not only in temporal dynamics but also group content modeling.\n\nThe dynamics over different groups vary, reflecting the groups' intention. GrosToT uncovers the interplay between group interest and temporal dynamics. Specifically, groups' attention to their medium-interested topics are event-driven, showing rich bursts; while its engagement in group's dominating topics are interest-driven, remaining stable over time.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Peking University", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Zhiting Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Zhiting", "Junjie Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Junjie", "Bin Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui_0001:Bin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
