{"title": "Clone MCMC: Parallel High-Dimensional Gaussian Gibbs Sampling.", "fields": ["gibbs sampling", "gaussian function", "gaussian random field", "markov chain monte carlo", "gaussian"], "abstract": "We propose a generalized Gibbs sampler algorithm for obtaining samples approximately distributed from a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Similarly to Hogwild methods, our approach does not target the original Gaussian distribution of interest, but an approximation to it. Contrary to Hogwild methods, a single parameter allows us to trade bias for variance. We show empirically that our method is very flexible and performs well compared to Hogwild-type algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux", "University of Oxford", "University of Bordeaux", "Oxford"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Andrei-Cristian Barbos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbos:Andrei=Cristian", "Francois Caron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caron:Francois", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Giovannelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giovannelli:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois", "Arnaud Doucet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doucet:Arnaud"], "pages": 9}
