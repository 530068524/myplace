The definition of an affine invariant metric enables us to construct an invariant Laplacian from which local and global geometric structures are extracted. Applications of the proposed framework demonstrate its power in generalizing and enriching the existing set of tools for shape analysis.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Lugano", "Tel Aviv University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dan Raviv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raviv:Dan", "Michael M.
