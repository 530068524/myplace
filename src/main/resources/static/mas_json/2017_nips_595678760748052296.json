Our method is based on a soft (continuous) relaxation of quantization and entropy, which we anneal to their discrete counterparts throughout training. We showcase this method for two challenging applications: Image compression and neural network compression. While these tasks have typically been approached with different methods, our soft-to-hard quantization approach gives results competitive with the state-of-the-art for both.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Eirikur Agustsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agustsson:Eirikur", "Fabian Mentzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mentzer:Fabian", "Michael Tschannen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tschannen:Michael", "Lukas Cavigelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cavigelli:Lukas", "Radu Timofte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Timofte:Radu", "Luca Benini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benini:Luca", "Luc J.
