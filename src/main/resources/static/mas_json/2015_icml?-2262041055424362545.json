{"title": "A Relative Exponential Weighing Algorithm for Adversarial Utility-based Dueling Bandits.", "fields": ["upper and lower bounds", "information retrieval applications", "exponential function", "regret", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "We study the K-armed dueling bandit problem which is a variation of the classical Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem in which the learner receives only relative feedback about the selected pairs of arms. We propose an efficient algorithm called Relative Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (REX3) to handle the adversarial utility-based formulation of this problem. We prove a finite time expected regret upper bound of order O(\u221aKln(K)T) for this algorithm and a general lower bound of order \u03a9(\u221aKT). At the end, we provide experimental results using real data from information retrieval applications.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Orange-labs, Lannion, France", "Orange-labs, Lannion, France", "Orange-labs, Lannion, France"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Pratik Gajane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gajane:Pratik", "Tanguy Urvoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urvoy:Tanguy", "Fabrice Cl\u00e9rot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cl=eacute=rot:Fabrice"], "pages": 10}
