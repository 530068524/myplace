This note presents results from a study where the angle, direction, diameter, and position of rotations were systematically manipulated. Subjects were asked to perform the rotations as quickly as possible without losing contact with the display, and were allowed to skip rotations that were too uncomfortable. The data show surprising interaction effects among the variables, and help us identify whole categories of rotations that are slow and cumbersome for users.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["University of Helsinki", "University of Glasgow", "Max Planck Society", "University of St Andrews", "University of St Andrews"], "authors": ["Eve E.
