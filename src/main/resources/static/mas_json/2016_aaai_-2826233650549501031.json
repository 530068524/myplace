However, for particular feature representations, e.g., histogram features like BOW and SPM, Mahalanobis metric could not model the correlations between these features well. In this work, we define a non-Mahalanobis distance for histogram features, via Expected Hitting Time (EHT) of Markov Chain, which implicitly considers the high-order feature relationships between different histogram features. The EHT based distance is parameterized by transition probabilities of Markov Chain, we consequently propose a novel type of distance learning approach (LED, Learning Expected hitting time Distance) to learn appropriate transition probabilities for EHT based distance. We validate the effectiveness of LED on a series of real-world datasets. Moreover, experiments show that the learned transition probabilities are with good comprehensibility.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["De-Chuan Zhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhan:De=Chuan", "Peng Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Peng", "Zui Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Zui", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 6}
