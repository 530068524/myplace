Exploiting this technique, we devise an optimisation of the classical algorithm by Hopcroft and Karp. We compare our approach to the recently introduced antichain algorithms, by analysing and relating the two underlying coinductive proof methods. We give concrete examples where we exponentially improve over antichains; experimental results moreover show non negligible improvements.", "citation": "Citations (117)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Filippo Bonchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonchi:Filippo", "Damien Pous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pous:Damien"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
