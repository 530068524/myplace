{"title": "A Distributed Method for Evaluating Properties of a Robot Formation.", "fields": ["operator", "computer science", "robot", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "As a robot formation increases in size or explores places where it is difficult for a human operator to interact, autonomous control becomes critical. We propose a distributed autonomous method for evaluating properties of multi-robot systems, and then discuss how this information can be applied to improve performance with respect to a given operation. We present this as an extension of our previous work on robot formations; however, the techniques described could be adapted to other multi-robot systems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Mobile Robotics ... wardsville, IL", "Mobile Robotics ... wardsville, IL"], "authors": ["Brent Beer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beer:Brent", "Ross Mead.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mead:Ross", "Jerry B.
