{"title": "r-Kernel: An operating system foundation for highly reliable networked embedded systems.", "fields": ["rollback", "exploit", "software quality", "software bug", "thread"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present r-kernel, an operating system kernel foundation specifically designed to improve software reliability in networked embedded systems. The key novelty of r-kernel lies in that it exploits the time dimension of software execution to improve robustness. Specifically, r-kernel keeps track of the execution of applications through checkpoints. If one application has been determined to have failed, r-kernel performs rollback operations to restore its state to one of those checkpoints created earlier. For the second round of operation, r-kernel provides a safe mode environment to avoid triggering the same bugs. Finally, if the whole system has crashed, r-kernel relies on watchdog timers to reset the node, and develops a technique called past-run trace reconstruction to locate and report the thread that had caused the system failure. We have implemented r-kernel based on the LiteOS operating system kernel running on the popular MicaZ platform. We demonstrate that it achieves the desired goals above with acceptable overhead.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Qing Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Qing", "Xiaorui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaorui", "Hairong Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Hairong", "Tian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Tian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
