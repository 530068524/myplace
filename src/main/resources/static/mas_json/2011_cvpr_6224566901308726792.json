We show that the expressive power of second order GRFs is already sufficient to express spatial relations between shape parts and simple shapes simultaneously. This allows to model and recognise complex shapes as spatial compositions of simpler parts.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Boris Flach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flach:Boris", "Dmitrij Schlesinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlesinger:Dmitrij"], "pages": 6}
