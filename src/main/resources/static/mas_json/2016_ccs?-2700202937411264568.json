{"title": "Mix&Slice: Efficient Access Revocation in the Cloud.", "fields": ["encryption", "cloud computing", "internet privacy", "revocation", "access control"], "abstract": "We present an approach to enforce access revocation on resources stored at external cloud providers. The approach relies on a resource transformation that provides strong mutual inter-dependency in its encrypted representation. To revoke access on a resource, it is then sufficient to update a small portion of it, with the guarantee that the resource as a whole (and any portion of it) will become unintelligible to those from whom access is revoked. The extensive experimental evaluation on a variety of configurations confirmed the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution, which showed excellent performance and compatibility with several implementation strategies.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Bergamo", "University of Milan", "University of Milan", "University of Bergamo", "University of Bergamo"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Enrico Bacis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bacis:Enrico", "Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vimercati:Sabrina_De_Capitani_di", "Sara Foresti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foresti:Sara", "Stefano Paraboschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paraboschi:Stefano", "Marco Rosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosa:Marco", "Pierangela Samarati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samarati:Pierangela"], "pages": 12}
