Existing adaptive methods suffer from the drifting problem, since they rely on self-updates of an on-line learning method. In contrast to previous work that tackled this problem by employing semi-supervised or multiple-instance learning, we show that augmenting an on-line learning method with complementary tracking approaches can lead to more stable results. In particular, we use a simple template model as a non-adaptive and thus stable component, a novel optical-flow-based mean-shift tracker as highly adaptive element and an on-line random forest as moderately adaptive appearance-based learner. We combine these three trackers in a cascade. All of our components run on GPUs or similar multi-core systems, which allows for real-time performance. We show the superiority of our system over current state-of-the-art tracking methods in several experiments on publicly available data.", "citation": "Citations (429)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jakob Santner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santner:Jakob", "Christian Leistner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leistner:Christian", "Amir Saffari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saffari:Amir", "Thomas Pock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pock:Thomas", "Horst Bischof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischof:Horst"], "pages": 8}
