Prior research mainly focuses on designing such access control modules for WSNs, but little attention has been paid to protect user's identity privacy when a user is verified by the network for data accesses. Often, a user does not want the WSN to associate his identity to the data he requests, particularly in a single-owner multi-user WSN. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel approach, Priccess, to ensure privacy-preserving access control. In addition to the theoretical analysis that demonstrates the security properties of Priccess, this paper also reports the experimental results of Priccess in a network of Imote2 motes, which show the efficiency of Priccess in practice.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Daojing He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Daojing", "Jiajun Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Jiajun", "Sencun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Sencun", "Mingjian Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Mingjian", "Yi Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yi", "Haodong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haodong", "Sammy Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Sammy", "Chun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
