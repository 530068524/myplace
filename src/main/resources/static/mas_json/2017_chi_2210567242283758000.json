{"title": "The Effect of Peripheral Micro-tasks on Crowd Ideation.", "fields": ["originality", "crowdsourcing", "peripheral", "fluency", "ideation"], "abstract": "Research has explored different ways of improving crowd ideation, such as presenting examples or employing facilitators. While such support is usually generated through peripheral tasks delegated to crowd workers who are not part of the ideation, it is possible that the ideators themselves could benefit from the extra thought involved in doing them. Therefore, we iterate over an ideation system in which ideators can perform one of three peripheral tasks (rating originality and usefulness, similarity, or idea combination) on demand. In controlled experiments with workers on Mechanical Turk, we compare the effects of these secondary tasks to simple idea exposure or no support at all, examining usage of the inspirations, fluency, breadth, and depth of ideas generated. We find tasks to be as good or better than exposure, although this depends on the period of ideation and the fluency level. We also discuss implications of inspiration size, homogeneity, and frequency.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "New York University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Victor Girotto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Girotto:Victor", "Erin Walker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walker:Erin", "Winslow Burleson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burleson:Winslow"], "pages": 12}
