We propose that even if an underlying vectorial representation exists, it is better to work directly with the dissimilarity matrix hence avoiding unnecessary bias and variance caused by embeddings. By using a Dirichlet process prior we are not obliged to fix the number of clusters in advance. Furthermore, our clustering model is permutation-, scale- and translation-invariant, and it is called the Translation-invariant Wishart Dirichlet (TIWD) process. A highly efficient MCMC sampling algorithm is presented. Experiments show that the TIWD process exhibits several advantages over competing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Basel", "University of Basel", "ETH Zurich", "University of Basel"], "authors": ["Julia E.
