We call it universum prescription by the fact that the prescribed labels cannot be one of the supervised labels. In spite of its simplicity, universum prescription obtained competitive results in training deep convolutional networks for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10 and ImageNet datasets. A qualitative justification of these approaches using Rademacher complexity is presented. The effect of a regularization parameter \u2014 probability of sampling from unlabeled data \u2014 is also studied empirically.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University"], "authors": ["Xiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiang", "Yann LeCun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/LeCun:Yann"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
