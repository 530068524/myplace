Unlike tractography methods that sample multiple fibers to be bundled together, we define a Markov field directly on the diffusion tensors to separate the main fiber tracts at the voxel level. A prior model of shape and direction guides a full segmentation of the brain into known fiber tracts; additional, unspecified fibers; and isotropic regions. The method is evaluated on various data sets from an atlasing project, healthy subjects, and multiple sclerosis patients.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Rochester Institute of Technology", "Utrecht University", "Utrecht University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "University of Houston", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "HRI Eur.
