While sugar is a valuable mechanism for implementing realistic languages, the expansion process obscures program source structure. As a result, type errors can reference terms the programmers did not write (and even constructs they do not know), baffling them. The language developer must also manually construct type rules for the sugars, to give a typed account of the surface language. We address these problems by presenting a process for automatically reconstructing type rules for the surface language using rules for the core. We have implemented this theory, and show several interesting case studies.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University"], "authors": ["Justin Pombrio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pombrio:Justin", "Shriram Krishnamurthi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthi:Shriram"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2018", "pages": 14}
