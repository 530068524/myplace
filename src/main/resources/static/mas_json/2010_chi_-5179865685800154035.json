{"title": "Why it's quick to be square: modelling new and existing hierarchical menu designs.", "fields": ["interface design", "pie menu", "grid", "visual search", "crossover"], "abstract": "We consider different hierarchical menu and toolbar-like interface designs from a theoretical perspective and show how a model based on visual search time, pointing time, decision time and expertise development can assist in understanding and predicting interaction performance. Three hierarchical menus designs are modelled -- a traditional pull-down menu, a pie menu and a novel Square Menu with its items arranged in a grid -- and the predictions are validated in an empirical study. The model correctly predicts the relative performance of the designs -- both the eventual dominance of Square Menus compared to traditional and pie designs and a performance crossover as users gain experience. Our work shows the value of modelling in HCI design, provides new insights about performance with different hierarchical menu designs, and demonstrates a new high-performance menu type.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Canterbury", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Manitoba", "Klagenfurt Univ ... enfurt, Austria"], "authors": ["David Ahlstr\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahlstr=ouml=m:David", "Andy Cockburn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cockburn:Andy", "Carl Gutwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gutwin:Carl", "Pourang Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Pourang"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
