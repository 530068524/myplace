{"title": "I4E: interactive investigation of iterative information extraction.", "fields": ["data mining", "debugging", "information extraction", "database", "tuple"], "abstract": "Information extraction systems are increasingly being used to mine structured information from unstructured text documents. A commonly used unsupervised technique is to build  iterative information extraction (IIE)  systems that learn task-specific rules, called  patterns , to generate the desired tuples. Oftentimes, output from an information extraction system may contain unexpected results which may be due to an incorrect pattern, incorrect tuple, or both. In such scenarios, users and developers of the extraction system could greatly benefit from an investigation tool that can quickly help them reason about and repair the output.   In this paper, we develop an approach for interactive post-extraction investigation for IIE systems. We formalize three important phases of this investigation, namely,  explain  the IIE result,  diagnose  the influential and problematic components, and  repair  the output from an information extraction system. We show how to characterize the execution of an IIE system and build a suite of algorithms to answer questions pertaining to each of these phases. We experimentally evaluate our proposed approach over several domains over a Web corpus of about 500 million documents. We show that our approach effectively enables post-extraction investigation, while maximizing the gain from user and developer interaction.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "AT&T Labs"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Anish Das Sarma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarma:Anish_Das", "Alpa Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Alpa", "Divesh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Divesh"], "pages": 12}
