We introduce the experimental online platform LabintheWild, which provides participants with personalized feedback in exchange for participation in behavioral studies. In comparison to conventional in-lab studies, LabintheWild enables the recruitment of participants at larger scale and from more diverse demographic and geographic backgrounds. We analyze Google Analytics data, participants' comments, and tweets to discuss how participants hear about the platform, and why they might choose to participate. Analyzing three example experiments, we additionally show that these experiments replicate previous in-lab study results with comparable data quality.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Katharina Reinecke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reinecke:Katharina", "Krzysztof Z.
