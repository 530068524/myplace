While this area has seen plenty of discussion, there is little rigorous experimentation addressing how biofeedback can enhance human-computer interaction. In our two-part study, (N=36) subjects first played eight different game stages with two implicit biofeedback conditions, with two simulation-based comparison and repetition rounds, then repeated the two biofeedback stages when given explicit information on the biofeedback. The biofeedback conditions were respiration and skin-conductance (EDA) adaptations. Adaptation targets were four balanced player avatar attributes. We collected data with psycho\u00acphysiological measures (electromyography, respiration, and EDA), a game experience questionnaire, and game-play measures.   According to our experiment, implicit biofeedback does not produce significant effects in player experience in an FPS game. In the explicit biofeedback conditions, players were more immersed and positively affected, and they were able to manipulate the game play with the biosignal interface. We recommend exploring the possibilities of using explicit biofeedback interaction in commercial games.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kai Kuikkaniemi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuikkaniemi:Kai", "Toni Laitinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laitinen:Toni", "Marko Turpeinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turpeinen:Marko", "Timo Saari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saari:Timo", "Ilkka Kosunen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosunen:Ilkka", "Niklas Ravaja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravaja:Niklas"], "pages": 10}
