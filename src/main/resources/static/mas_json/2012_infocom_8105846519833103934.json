{"title": "Semi-dynamic Hawk and Dove game, applied to power control.", "fields": ["battery", "power control", "nash equilibrium", "channel", "sequential game"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study a power control game over a collision channel. Each player has an energy state. When choosing a higher transmission power, the chance of a successful transmission (in the presence of other interference) increases at the cost of a larger decrease in the energy state of the battery. We study this dynamic game when restricting to simple non-dynamic strategies that consist of choosing a given power level that is maintained during the lifetime of the battery. We identify a surprising paradox in our Hawk-Dove game which we term the initial energy paradox.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Ghent University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Eitan Altman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altman:Eitan", "Dieter Fiems.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiems:Dieter", "Majed Haddad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haddad:Majed", "Julien Gaillard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaillard:Julien"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
