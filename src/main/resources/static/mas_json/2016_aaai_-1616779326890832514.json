Previous studies have shown that under appropriate conditions, gradient-based methods enjoy a geometric convergence rate when applied to this problem. However, the time complexity of evaluating the gradient is as large as O(nd), where n is the number of data points and d is the dimensionality, making those methods inefficient for large-scale and high-dimensional dataset. To address this limitation, we first utilize random projection to find a rank-k approximator for the data matrix, and reduce the cost of gradient evaluation to O(nk + dk), a significant improvement when k is much smaller than d and n. Then, we solve the sparse linear regression problem via a proximal gradient method with a homotopy strategy to generate sparse intermediate solutions. Theoretical analysis shows that our method also achieves a global geometric convergence rate, and moreover the sparsity of all the intermediate solutions are well-bounded over the iterations. Finally, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Nanjing University", "Alibaba Group", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Weizhong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Weizhong", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Lijun", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Deng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Deng", "Xiaofei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaofei"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
