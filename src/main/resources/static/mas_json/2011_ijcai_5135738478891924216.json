{"title": "Unsupervised Lexicon Acquisition for HPSG-Based Relation Extraction.", "fields": ["parsing", "lexicon", "grammar", "relationship extraction", "head driven phrase structure grammar"], "abstract": "The paper describes a method of relation extraction, which is based on parsing the input text using a combination of a generic HPSG-based grammar and a highly focused domain-and relation-specific lexicon. We also show a method of unsupervised acquisition of such a lexicon from a large unlabeled corpus. Together, the methods introduce a novel approach to the \"Open IE\" task, which is superior in accuracy and in quality of relation identification to the existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Benjamin Rozenfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rozenfeld:Benjamin", "Ronen Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Ronen"], "pages": 6}
