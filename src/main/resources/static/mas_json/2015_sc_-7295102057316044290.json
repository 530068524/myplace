We propose a novel mechanism,  Frugal ECC (FECC) , that combines ECC with fine-grained compression to provide versatile protection that can be both stronger and lower overhead than current schemes, without sacrificing performance. FECC compresses main memory at cache-block granularity, using any left over space to store ECC information. Compressed data and its ECC information are then frequently read with a single access even without redundant memory chips; insufficiently compressed blocks require additional storage and accesses. As examples, we present chipkill-correct ECCs on a non-ECC DIMM with x4 chips and the first true chipkill-correct ECC for x8 devices using an ECC DIMM. FECC relies on a new Coverage-oriented-Compression that we developed specifically for the modest compression needs of ECC and for floating-point data.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Jungrae Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jungrae", "Michael B.
