{"title": "A study of Linux file system evolution.", "fields": ["operating system", "database", "fstab", "engineering", "file system", "computer science"], "abstract": "We conduct a comprehensive study of file-system code evolution. By analyzing eight years of Linux file-system changes across 5079 patches, we derive numerous new (and sometimes surprising) insights into the file-system development process; our results should be useful for both the development of file systems themselves as well as the improvement of bug-finding tools.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Lanyue Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Lanyue", "Andrea C.
