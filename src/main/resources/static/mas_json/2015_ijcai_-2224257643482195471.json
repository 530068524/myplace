We give a Bayesian interpretation to one of Valiant's classic PAC learning algorithms, which we then build upon to derive three efficient, online, probabilistic, supervised learning algorithms for predicting the output of an unknown k-CNF Boolean function. We analyze the loss of our methods, and show that the cumulative log-loss can be upper bounded by a polynomial function of the size of each example.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Google", "Australian National University", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Joel Veness.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veness:Joel", "Marcus Hutter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hutter:Marcus", "Laurent Orseau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orseau:Laurent", "Marc G.
