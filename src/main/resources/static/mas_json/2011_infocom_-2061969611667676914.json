To give insight into the geography of the Internet, we examine the spatial properties of the topology and routing. To represent the network we conducted a geographically dispersed traceroute campaign, and embedded the extracted topology into the geographic space by applying a novel IP geolocalization service, called Spotter. In this paper we present the frequency analysis of link lengths, quantify path circuitousness and explore the symmetry of end-to-end Internet routes.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University", "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University", "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University", "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University", "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University"], "authors": ["P\u00e9ter M\u00e1tray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=aacute=tray:P=eacute=ter", "P\u00e9ter H\u00e1ga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=aacute=ga:P=eacute=ter", "S\u00e1ndor Laki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laki:S=aacute=ndor", "Istv\u00e1n Csabai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Csabai:Istv=aacute=n", "G\u00e1bor Vattay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vattay:G=aacute=bor"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
