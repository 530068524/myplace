{"title": "SketchVisor: Robust Network Measurement for Software Packet Processing.", "fields": ["packet processing", "packet analyzer", "fast path", "forwarding plane", "processing delay"], "abstract": "Network measurement remains a missing piece in today's software packet processing platforms. Sketches provide a promising building block for filling this void by monitoring every packet with fixed-size memory and bounded errors. However, our analysis shows that existing sketch-based measurement solutions suffer from severe performance drops under high traffic load. Although sketches are efficiently designed, applying them in network measurement inevitably incurs heavy computational overhead.   We present SketchVisor, a robust network measurement framework for software packet processing. It augments sketch-based measurement in the data plane with a fast path, which is activated under high traffic load to provide high-performance local measurement with slight accuracy degradations. It further recovers accurate network-wide measurement results via compressive sensing. We have built a SketchVisor prototype on top of Open vSwitch. Extensive testbed experiments show that SketchVisor achieves high throughput and high accuracy for a wide range of network measurement tasks and microbenchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Huawei", "Johns Hopkins University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Huawei", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Qun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Qun", "Xin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xin", "Patrick P.
