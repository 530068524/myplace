{"title": "Sequence-to-Action: End-to-End Semantic Graph Generation for Semantic Parsing.", "fields": ["graph", "parsing", "feature learning", "end to end principle", "sentence"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a neural semantic parsing approach -- Sequence-to-Action, which models semantic parsing as an end-to-end semantic graph generation process. Our method simultaneously leverages the advantages from two recent promising directions of semantic parsing. Firstly, our model uses a semantic graph to represent the meaning of a sentence, which has a tight-coupling with knowledge bases. Secondly, by leveraging the powerful representation learning and prediction ability of neural network models, we propose a RNN model which can effectively map sentences to action sequences for semantic graph generation. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on OVERNIGHT dataset and gets competitive performance on GEO and ATIS datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Le Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Le", "Xianpei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Xianpei", "Bo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bo"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2018", "pages": 12}
