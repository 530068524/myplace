{"title": "Model-level, platform-independent debugging in the context of the model-driven development of real-time systems.", "fields": ["code generation", "debugging", "modeling language", "debugger", "use case"], "abstract": "Providing proper support for debugging models at model-level is one of the main barriers to a broader adoption of Model Driven Development (MDD). In this paper, we focus on the use of MDD for the development of real-time embedded systems (RTE). We introduce a new platform-independent approach to implement model-level debuggers. We describe how to realize support for model-level debugging entirely in terms of the modeling language and show how to implement this support in terms of a model-to-model transformation. Key advantages of the approach over existing work are that (1) it does not require a program debugger for the code generated from the model, and that (2) any changes to, e.g., the code generator, the target language, or the hardware platform leave the debugger completely unaffected. We also describe an implementation of the approach in the context of Papyrus-RT, an open source MDD tool based on the modeling language UML-RT. We summarize the results of the use of our model-based debugger on several use cases to determine its overhead in terms of size and performance. Despite being a prototype, the performance overhead is in the order of microseconds, while the size overhead is comparable with that of GDB, the GNU Debugger.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Queen's University", "Queen's University", "Queen's University"], "authors": ["Mojtaba Bagherzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagherzadeh:Mojtaba", "Nicolas Hili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hili:Nicolas", "Juergen Dingel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dingel:Juergen"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
