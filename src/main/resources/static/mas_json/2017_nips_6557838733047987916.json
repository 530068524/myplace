{"title": "Non-monotone Continuous DR-submodular Maximization: Structure and Algorithms.", "fields": ["stationary point", "point process", "continuous function", "subclass", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "DR-submodular continuous functions are important objectives with wide real-world applications spanning MAP inference in determinantal point processes (DPPs), and mean-field inference for probabilistic submodular models, amongst others. DR-submodularity captures a subclass of non-convex functions that enables both exact minimization and approximate maximization in polynomial time. In this work we study the problem of maximizing non-monotone DR-submodular continuous functions under general down-closed convex constraints. We start by investigating geometric properties that underlie such objectives, e.g., a strong relation between (approximately) stationary points and global optimum is proved. These properties are then used to devise two optimization algorithms with provable guarantees. Concretely, we first devise a \"two-phase'' algorithm with 1/4 approximation guarantee. This algorithm allows the use of existing methods for finding (approximately) stationary points as a subroutine, thus, harnessing recent progress in non-convex optimization. Then we present a non-monotone Frank-Wolfe variant with 1/e approximation guarantee and sublinear convergence rate. Finally, we extend our approach to a broader class of generalized DR-submodular continuous functions, which captures a wider spectrum of applications. Our theoretical findings are validated on synthetic and real-world problem instances.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Andrew An Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Andrew_An", "Kfir Yehuda Levy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levy:Kfir_Yehuda", "Andreas Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause_0001:Andreas", "Joachim M.
