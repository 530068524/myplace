The normalized cut problem balances the total degree, instead of the size, of the resulting sets. Applications of graph cuts include community detection and computer vision. However, cut problems were originally proposed for static graphs, an assumption that does not hold in many modern applications where graphs are highly dynamic. In this paper, we introduce the sparsest and normalized cut problems in temporal graphs, which generalize their standard definitions by enforcing the smoothness of cuts over time. We propose novel formulations and algorithms for computing temporal cuts using spectral graph theory, multiplex graphs, divide-and-conquer and low-rank matrix approximation. Furthermore, we extend our formulation to dynamic graph signals, where cuts also capture node values. Experiments show that our solutions are accurate and scalable, enabling the discovery of dynamic communities and the analysis of dynamic graph processes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "United States Army Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Arlei Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva:Arlei", "Ambuj K.
