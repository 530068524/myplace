{"title": "Exploring portfolio scheduling for long-term execution of scientific workloads in IaaS clouds.", "fields": ["scheduling", "portfolio", "parallel computing", "payment", "provisioning"], "abstract": "Long-term execution of scientific applications often leads to dynamic workloads and varying application requirements. When the execution uses resources provisioned from IaaS clouds, and thus consumption-related payment, efficient and online scheduling algorithms must be found. Portfolio scheduling, which selects dynamically a suitable policy from a broad portfolio, may provide a solution to this problem. However, selecting online the right policy from possibly tens of alternatives remains challenging. In this work, we introduce an abstract model to explore this selection problem. Based on the model, we present a comprehensive portfolio scheduler that includes tens of provisioning and allocation policies. We propose an algorithm that can enlarge the chance of selecting the best policy in limited time, possibly online. Through trace-based simulation, we evaluate various aspects of our portfolio scheduler, and find performance improvements from 7% to 100% in comparison with the best constituent policies and high improvement for bursty workloads.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Kefeng Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Kefeng", "Junqiang Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junqiang", "Kaijun Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Kaijun", "Alexandru Iosup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iosup:Alexandru"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
