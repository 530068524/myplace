{"title": "Dynamic Early Stopping for Naive Bayes.", "fields": ["naive bayes classifier", "executable", "feature selection", "early stopping", "mobile device"], "abstract": "Energy efficiency is a concern for any software running on mobile devices. As such software employs machine-learned models to make predictions, this motivates research on efficiently executable models. In this paper, we propose a variant of the widely used Naive Bayes (NB) learner that yields a more efficient predictive model. In contrast to standard NB, where the learned model inspects all features to come to a decision, or NB with feature selection, where the model uses a fixed subset of the features, our model dynamically determines, on a case-by-case basis, when to stop inspecting features. We show that our approach is often much more efficient than the current state of the art, without loss of accuracy.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["A\u00e4ron Verachtert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verachtert:A=auml=ron", "Hendrik Blockeel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blockeel:Hendrik", "Jesse Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Jesse"], "pages": 7}
