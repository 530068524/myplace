{"title": "Mobility in Later Life: Appropriation of an Integrated Transportation Platform.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "appropriation", "qualitative research", "participatory design", "information system"], "abstract": "We present the results of a design case study focusing on supporting the daily transportation of elderly in Germany. We conceptualized, developed and studied the appropriation of a transportation information system intended to ease switching between different transportation modes. Based on a literature review and a context study with 21 interviews we explored routinized transport mode usage and barriers when switching between modes. Iteratively, we co-designed a transport platform accessible via a website, a mobile app, and an iTV app. We further looked at the appropriation of the platform into the daily lives of 19 persons. Studying the appropriation highlighted different factors that facilitate the adoption of alternative transport options. The factors included reducing uncertainty, complementing transport information with context information (e.g. weather) and providing informational access based on the user's preferences as well as fitting in with the situational needs (activity related).", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "Fraunhofer Society", "University of Siegen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Martin Stein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stein:Martin", "Johanna Meurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meurer:Johanna", "Alexander Boden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boden:Alexander", "Volker Wulf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulf:Volker"], "pages": 14}
