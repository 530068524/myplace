{"title": "Content-aware photo-on-photo composition for consumer photos.", "fields": ["multimedia", "computer vision", "redundancy", "composition", "saliency map"], "abstract": "We propose an approach to automatically generate photo-on-photo compositions using only a consumer's own image collection, without imposing a strong theme constraint dictated by typical background art designs. Our goal is to ensure adequate foreground and background photo sizing, avoid occlusion of important background photo content, and respect simple aesthetic rules in photo arrangement. We propose a novel image content redundancy measure to extract the informative zone, which is a rectangular region of the background photo that should not be occluded by foreground content. Background photo layout and foreground layout regions are then calculated based on a placement algorithm that deals with possible aspect ratio mismatch of the canvas and background photo, as well as cases of insufficient foreground photo layout area.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Aibo Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Aibo", "Xuemei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xuemei", "Daniel Tretter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tretter:Daniel"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
