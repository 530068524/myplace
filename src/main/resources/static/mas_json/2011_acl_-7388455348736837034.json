{"title": "Integrating history-length interpolation and classes in language modeling.", "fields": ["perplexity", "rare events", "standard language", "language model", "equivalence class"], "abstract": "Building on earlier work that integrates different factors in language modeling, we view (i) backing off to a shorter history and (ii) class-based generalization as two complementary mechanisms of using a larger equivalence class for prediction when the default equivalence class is too small for reliable estimation. This view entails that the classes in a language model should be learned from rare events only and should be preferably applied to rare events. We construct such a model and show that both training on rare events and preferable application to rare events improve perplexity when compared to a simple direct interpolation of class-based with standard language models.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hinrich Sch\u00fctze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=tze:Hinrich"], "pages": 10}
