{"title": "Control-plane protocol interactions in cellular networks.", "fields": ["computer network", "routing control plane", "distributed computing", "cellular network", "computer security"], "abstract": "Control-plane protocols are complex in cellular networks. They communicate with one another along three dimensions of cross layers, cross (circuit-switched and packet-switched) domains, and cross (3G and 4G) systems. In this work, we propose signaling diagnosis tools and uncover six instances of problematic interactions. Such control-plane issues span both design defects in the 3GPP standards and operational slips by carriers. They are more damaging than data-plane failures. In the worst-case scenario, users may be out of service in 4G, or get stuck in 3G. We deduce root causes, propose solutions, and summarize learned lessons.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Ohio State University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Guan-Hua Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Guan=Hua", "Yuanjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanjie", "Chunyi Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Chunyi", "Chi-Yu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chi=Yu", "Hongyi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hongyi", "Songwu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Songwu"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
