We use this connection to prove the first lower bounds on general probabilistic multi-round instance compression. We show that there s no probabilistic multi-round compression protocol for Parity in which the computationally bounded party uses a non-uniform AC0-circuit and transmits at most n/(log(n))^{\\omega(1)} bits. This result is tight, and strengthens results of Dubrov and Ishai. We also show that a similar lower bound holds for Majority. We also consider the question of {\\it round separation}, i.e., whether for each r >= 1, there are functions which can be compressed better with r rounds of compression than with r-1 rounds. We answer this question affirmatively for compression using constant-depth polynomial-size circuits. Finally, we prove the first non-trivial lower bounds for 1-round compressibility of Parity by polynomial size ACC0[p] circuits where p is an odd prime.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "School of Informatics"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Arkadev Chattopadhyay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chattopadhyay:Arkadev", "Rahul Santhanam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santhanam:Rahul"], "pages": 10}
