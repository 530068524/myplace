{"title": "A handle bar metaphor for virtual object manipulation with mid-air interaction.", "fields": ["repertoire", "virtual image", "visual control", "gesture", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "Commercial 3D scene acquisition systems such as the Microsoft  Kinect  sensor can reduce the cost barrier of realizing mid-air interaction. However, since it can only sense hand position but not hand orientation robustly, current mid-air interaction methods for 3D virtual object manipulation often require contextual and mode switching to perform translation, rotation, and scaling, thus preventing natural continuous gestural interactions. A novel  handle bar metaphor  is proposed as an effective visual control metaphor between the user's hand gestures and the corresponding virtual object manipulation operations. It mimics a familiar situation of handling objects that are skewered with a bimanual handle bar. The use of relative 3D motion of the two hands to design the mid-air interaction allows us to provide precise controllability despite the  Kinect  sensor's low image resolution. A comprehensive repertoire of 3D manipulation operations is proposed to manipulate single objects, perform fast constrained rotation, and pack/align multiple objects along a line. Three user studies were devised to demonstrate the efficacy and intuitiveness of the proposed interaction techniques on different virtual manipulation scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Peng Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Peng", "Wooi-Boon Goh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goh:Wooi=Boon", "William Hutama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hutama:William", "Chi-Wing Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Chi=Wing", "Xiaopei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaopei"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
