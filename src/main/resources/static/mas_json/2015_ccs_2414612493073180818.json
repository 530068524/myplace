{"title": "Detecting and Exploiting Second Order Denial-of-Service Vulnerabilities in Web Applications.", "fields": ["secure coding", "denial of service attack", "symbolic execution", "program analysis", "web application"], "abstract": "This paper describes a new class of denial-of-service (DoS) attack, which we refer to as  Second Order DoS  attacks. These attacks consist of two phases, one that pollutes a database with junk entries and another that performs a costly operation on these entries to cause resource exhaustion. The main contribution of this paper is a static analysis for detecting second-order DoS vulnerabilities in web applications. We have implemented our analysis in a tool called Torpedo, and we show that Torpedo can successfully detect second-order DoS vulnerabilities in widely used web applications written in PHP. Once our tool discovers a vulnerability, it also performs symbolic execution to generate candidate attack vectors. We evaluate Torpedo on six widely-used web applications and show that it uncovers 37 security vulnerabilities, while reporting 18 false positives.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Oswaldo Olivo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivo:Oswaldo", "Isil Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Isil", "Calvin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Calvin"], "pages": 13}
