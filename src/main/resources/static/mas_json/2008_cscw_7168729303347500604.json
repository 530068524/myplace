They require technical infrastructure to support a broad division of labor. Yet the research literature lacks empirical studies that detail which types of work are valued by participants in an online community. A content analysis of Wikipedia  barnstars  -- personalized tokens of appreciation given to participants -- reveals a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work. Our analysis develops a theoretical lens for understanding how wiki software supports the creation of articulations of work. We give implications of our results for communities engaged in large-scale collaborations.", "citation": "Citations (170)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Travis Kriplean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kriplean:Travis", "Ivan Beschastnikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beschastnikh:Ivan", "David W.
