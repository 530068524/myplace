{"title": "The Impact of Disjunction on Query Answering Under Guarded-Based Existential Rules.", "fields": ["algorithm", "conjunctive query", "negation", "subclass", "description logic", "existentialism", "mathematics", "exptime"], "abstract": "We study the complexity of conjunctive query answering under (weakly-)(frontier-)guarded disjunctive existential rules, i.e., existential rules extended with disjunction, and their main subclasses, linear rules and inclusion dependencies (IDs). Our main result states that conjunctive query answering under a fixed set of disjunctive IDs is 2EXPTIME-hard. This quite surprising result together with a 2EXPTIME upper bound for weakly-frontier-guarded disjunctive rules, obtained by exploiting recent results on guarded negation first-order logic, gives us a complete picture of the computational complexity of our problem. We also consider a natural subclass of disjunctive IDs, namely frontier-one (only one variable is propagated), for which the combined complexity decreases to EXPTIME. Finally, we show that frontier-guarded rules, combined with negative constraints, are strictly more expressive than DL-LiteboolH, one of the most expressive languages of the DL-Lite family. We also show that query answering under DL-LiteboolH is 2EXPTIME- complete in combined complexity.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Pierre Bourhis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourhis:Pierre", "Michael Morak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morak:Michael", "Andreas Pieris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pieris:Andreas"], "pages": 7}
