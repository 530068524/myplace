The main focus of my dissertation is long-term interaction with an Artificial Conversational Companion in the context of conversation training for second language acquisition. I use a data-driven approach and conversation analysis methods to build computational models for long-term interaction as a meaningful activity. I work on the concept of interaction profiles for human-agent interaction. The resulting models will be integrated in an AIML-based chatbot that helps to practice conversation in a foreign language.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Sviatlana Danilava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danilava:Sviatlana"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
