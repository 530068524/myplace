In this paper we discuss several design iterations of an instrumented cigarette lighter the records when it is used, to provide the ground-truth for detection from sensor signals measured at the human body, or to provide an alternative low-delay detection mechanism for smoking.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Siegen"], "authors": ["Philipp M.
