{"title": "Adaptive Selective Replication for Complex Event Processing Systems.", "fields": ["latency", "complex event processing", "trade off", "resource consumption", "gene duplication"], "abstract": "As of today, active replication is used in complex event processing systems to enable near zero latency take over in case of host failures. Moreover, elastic complex event processing systems adapt their resource consumption to the actual system load. However, active replication is a coarse-grained approach demanding the duplication of all used resources. Therefore, we envision a system adopting adaptive fine-grained replication strategies allowing to trade off availability and used resources.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["SAP SE", "SAP SE", "University of Neuch\u00e2tel"], "authors": ["Franz Josef Gr\u00fcneberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=uuml=neberger:Franz_Josef", "Thomas Heinze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinze_0001:Thomas", "Pascal Felber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felber:Pascal"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
