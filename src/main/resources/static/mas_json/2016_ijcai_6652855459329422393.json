{"title": "A POMDP Approach to Influence Diagram Evaluation.", "fields": ["observable", "influence diagram", "partially observable markov decision process", "markov decision process", "state variable"], "abstract": "We propose a node-removal/arc-reversal algorithm for influence diagram evaluation that includes reductions that allow an influence diagram to be solved by a generalization of the dynamic programming approach to solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Among its potential advantages, the algorithm allows a more flexible ordering of node removals, and a POMDP-inspired approach to optimizing over hidden state variables, which can improve the scalability of influence diagram evaluation in solving complex, multi-stage problems. It also finds a more compact representation of an optimal strategy.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Mississippi State University", "Mississippi State University", "Mississippi State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Eric A.
