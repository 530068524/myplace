Since there is a growing body of work in Ubicomp around health practices, including systems to support healthy eating, it is important to understand how people apply the knowledge they have to food decisions. In our studies we identified 8 attributes participants use for determining if they think a food is \"healthy\" or not. Based upon our analysis, we reflect on current system designs and propose four future design opportunities: capturing context of healthy eating, preparation and reflection on healthy eating understanding, sharing understanding and in situ information support.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Feng Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Feng", "Enrico Costanza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costanza:Enrico", "Monica M.
