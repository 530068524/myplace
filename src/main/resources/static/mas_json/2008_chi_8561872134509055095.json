We discuss the potential benefits of this approach while focusing on low-level of autonomy tasks. We present an experimental robotic interaction test bed to support our investigation. We use the test bed to explore two HRI-related task-sets: robotic navigation control and robotic posture control. We discuss the implementation of these two task-sets using an AIBO\" robot dog. Both tasks were mapped to two different robotic control interfaces: keypad interface which resembles the interaction approach currently common in HRI, and a gesture input mechanism based on Nintendo Wii\" game controllers. We discuss the interfaces implementation and conclude with a detailed user study for evaluating these different HRI techniques in the two robotic tasks-sets.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Cheng Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Cheng", "Ehud Sharlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharlin:Ehud"], "pages": 10}
