In this paper, we propose a graph-based affinity (metric) learning method and show its application to image clustering and segmentation. Our method, self-diffusion (SD), performs a diffusion process by propagating the similarity mass along the intrinsic manifold of data points. Theoretical analysis is given to the SD algorithm and we provide a way of deriving the critical time stamp t. Our method therefore has nearly no parameter tuning and leads to significantly improved affinity maps, which help to greatly enhance the quality of clustering. In addition, we show that much improved image segmentation results can be obtained by combining SD with e.g. the normalized cuts algorithm. The proposed method can be used to deliver robust affinity maps for a range of problems.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Bo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Bo", "Zhuowen Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Zhuowen"], "pages": 8}
