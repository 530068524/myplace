The repository is intended to fill in a gap in the existing literature to systematically benchmark the performance of these algorithms using a consistent experimental setting. The experiment will be focused on the application of face recognition, where a sparse representation framework has recently been developed to recover human identities from facial images that may be affected by illumination change, occlusion, and facial disguise. The paper also provides useful guidelines to practitioners working in similar fields.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "South Ural State University", "South Ural State University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "University of M\u00e1laga", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Washington", "Princeton University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Folkwang University of the Arts", "University of M\u00e1laga", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "University of M\u00e1laga"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["S\u00e9bastien Bubeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bubeck:S=eacute=bastien", "Michael B.
