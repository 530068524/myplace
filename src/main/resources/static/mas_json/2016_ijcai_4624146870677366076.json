{"title": "Intersubjectivity and Sentiment: From Language to Knowledge.", "fields": ["conceptualization", "intersubjectivity", "subjectivity", "convolutional neural network", "sentiment analysis"], "abstract": "Intersubjectivity is an important concept in psychology and sociology. It refers to sharing conceptualizations through social interactions in a community and using such shared conceptualization as a resource to interpret things that happen in everyday life. In this work, we make use of intersubjectivity as the basis to model shared stance and subjectivity for sentiment analysis. We construct an intersubjectivity network which links review writers, terms they used, as well as the polarities of the terms. Based on this network model, we propose a method to learn writer embeddings which are subsequently incorporated into a convolutional neural network for sentiment analysis. Evaluations on the IMDB, Yelp 2013 and Yelp 2014 datasets show that the proposed approach has achieved the state-of-the-art performance.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Aston University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Lin Gui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gui_0003:Lin", "Ruifeng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ruifeng", "Yulan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yulan", "Qin Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Qin", "Zhongyu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Zhongyu"], "pages": 7}
