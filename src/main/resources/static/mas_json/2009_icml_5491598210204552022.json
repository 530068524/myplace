{"title": "Analytic moment-based Gaussian process filtering.", "fields": ["ensemble kalman filter", "filtering problem", "gaussian random field", "gaussian filter", "gaussian function"], "abstract": "We propose an analytic moment-based filter for nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems modeled by Gaussian processes. Exact expressions for the expected value and the covariance matrix are provided for both the prediction step and the filter step, where an additional Gaussian assumption is exploited in the latter case. Our filter does not require further approximations. In particular, it avoids finite-sample approximations. We compare the filter to a variety of Gaussian filters, that is, the EKF, the UKF, and the recent GP-UKF proposed by Ko et al. (2007).", "citation": "Citations (112)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Marc Peter Deisenroth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deisenroth:Marc_Peter", "Marco F.
