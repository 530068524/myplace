The smaller the transistors are, less energy is required to flip a bit, and thus silent data corruptions (SDCs) become more common. In this paper, we present FlipBack, an automatic software-based approach that protects applications from SDCs. FlipBack provides targeted protection for different types of data and calculations based on their characteristics. It leverages compile-time analysis and program markup to identify data critical for control flow and enables selective replication of computation by the runtime system. We evaluate FlipBack with various HPC mini-applications that capture the behavior of real scientific applications and show that FlipBack is able to protect applications from most silent data corruptions with only 6 -- 20% performance degradation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Yorktown Heights"], "authors": ["Xiang Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Xiang", "Laxmikant V.
