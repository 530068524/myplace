We report in this work a key observation of CDCL solvers behavior on this family of benchmarks and explain it by an unsuspected side effect of their particular Clause Learning scheme. This new paradigm allows us to solve an important, still open, question: How to designing a fast, static, accurate, and predictive measure of new learnt clauses pertinence. Our paper is followed by empirical evidences that show how our new learning scheme improves state-of-the art results by an order of magnitude on both SAT and UNSAT industrial problems.", "citation": "Citations (531)", "departments": ["university of lille", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Gilles Audemard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Audemard:Gilles", "Laurent Simon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simon:Laurent"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
