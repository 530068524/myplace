{"title": "Riemannian coding and dictionary learning: Kernels to the rescue.", "fields": ["neural coding", "euclidean geometry", "k svd", "special case", "generality"], "abstract": "While sparse coding on non-flat Riemannian manifolds has recently become increasingly popular, existing solutions either are dedicated to specific manifolds, or rely on optimization problems that are difficult to solve, especially when it comes to dictionary learning. In this paper, we propose to make use of kernels to perform coding and dictionary learning on Riemannian manifolds. To this end, we introduce a general Riemannian coding framework with its kernel-based counterpart. This lets us (i) generalize beyond the special case of sparse coding; (ii) introduce efficient solutions to two coding schemes; (iii) learn the kernel parameters; (iv) perform unsupervised and supervised dictionary learning in a much simpler manner than previous Riemannian coding methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three different types of non-flat manifolds, and illustrate its generality by applying it to Euclidean spaces, which also are Riemannian manifolds.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mehrtash Tafazzoli Harandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harandi:Mehrtash_Tafazzoli", "Mathieu Salzmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salzmann:Mathieu"], "pages": 10}
