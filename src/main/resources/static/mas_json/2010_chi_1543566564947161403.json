{"title": "Avaaj Otalo: a field study of an interactive voice forum for small farmers in rural India.", "fields": ["voice user interface", "software deployment", "usage data", "online community", "social space"], "abstract": "In this paper we present the results of a field study of Avaaj Otalo (literally, \"voice stoop\"), an interactive voice application for small-scale farmers in Gujarat, India. Through usage data and interviews, we describe how 51 farmers used the system over a seven month pilot deployment. The most popular feature of Avaaj Otalo was a forum for asking questions and browsing others' questions and responses on a range of agricultural topics. The forum developed into a lively social space with the emergence of norms, persistent moderation, and a desire for both structured interaction with institutionally sanctioned authorities and open discussion with peers. For all 51 users this was the first experience participating in an online community of any sort. In terms of usability, simple menu-based navigation was readily learned, with users preferring numeric input over speech. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for designing voice-based social media serving rural communities in India and elsewhere.", "citation": "Citations (287)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of California, Berkeley", "IBM", "University of California, Berkeley", "Development Sup ... hmedabad, India"], "authors": ["Neil Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Neil", "Deepti Chittamuru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chittamuru:Deepti", "Anupam Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Anupam", "Paresh Dave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dave:Paresh", "Tapan S.
