The trace reconstruction problem is to recover an unknown string x \u220a from many independent outputs (called traces) of the deletion channel applied to x.We show that if x is drawn uniformly at random and q", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Yuval Peres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peres:Yuval", "Alex Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Alex"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
