In this article we provide a unifying perspective of these two algorithms by showing that their search-directions in the parameter space are closely related to the search-direction of an approximate Newton method. This analysis leads naturally to the consideration of this approximate Newton method as an alternative optimisation method for Markov Decision Processes. We are able to show that the algorithm has numerous desirable properties, absent in the naive application of Newton's method, that make it a viable alternative to either Expectation Maximisation or natural gradient ascent. Empirical results suggest that the algorithm has excellent convergence and robustness properties, performing strongly in comparison to both Expectation Maximisation and natural gradient ascent.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Thomas Furmston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furmston:Thomas", "David Barber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barber:David"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
