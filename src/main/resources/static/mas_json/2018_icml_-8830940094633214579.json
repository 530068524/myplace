Here, we employ a supervised scheme, Feedback-based Online Local Learning Of Weights (FOLLOW), to train a network of heterogeneous spiking neurons with hidden layers, to control a two-link arm so as to reproduce a desired state trajectory. The network first learns an inverse model of the non-linear dynamics, i.e. from state trajectory as input to the network, it learns to infer the continuous-time command that produced the trajectory. Connection weights are adjusted via a local plasticity rule that involves pre-synaptic firing and post-synaptic feedback of the error in the inferred command. We choose a network architecture, termed differential feedforward, that gives the lowest test error from different feedforward and recurrent architectures. The learned inverse model is then used to generate a continuous-time motor command to control the arm, given a desired trajectory.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Bonn", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Aditya Gilra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilra:Aditya", "Wulfram Gerstner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerstner:Wulfram"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
