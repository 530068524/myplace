In this paper, we examine learning tasks where one is presented with multiple multivariate time-series, as well as a relational graph among the different time-series. We propose an L1 regularized hidden Markov random field regression framework to leverage the information provided by the relational graph and jointly infer more accurate temporal causal structures for all time-series. We test the proposed model on climate modeling and cross-species microarray data analysis applications.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Yan", "Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niculescu=Mizil:Alexandru", "Aurelie C.
