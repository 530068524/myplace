Despite the fact that related entities are relevant to users' search queries, sometimes users cannot easily understand the recommended entities without evidences. This paper proposes a statistical model consisting of four sub-models to generate evidences for entities, which can help users better understand each recommended entity, and figure out the connections between the recommended entities and a given query. The experiments show that our method is domain independent, and can generate catchy and interesting evidences in the application of entity recommendation.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Baidu", "Baidu", "Baidu", "Baidu"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jizhou Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jizhou", "Shiqi Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shiqi", "Shiqiang Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Shiqiang", "Haiyang Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Haiyang", "Mingming Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Mingming", "Haifeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haifeng"], "pages": 7}
