In this paper, we demonstrate that hubness, which occurs in high dimensional data, is exploited by the attacks. Hence we explore methods for reducing hubness in user-response data to make these systems robust against attacks. Using the MovieLens dataset, we empirically show that the two methods for reducing hubness by transforming a similarity matrix(i) centering and (ii) conversion to a commute time kernel-can thwart attacks without degrading the recommendation performance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National Institute of Genetics", "The Institute o ... a, Tokyo, Japan", "The Institute o ... a, Tokyo, Japan", "The Institute o ... a, Tokyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Kazuo Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hara:Kazuo", "Ikumi Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Ikumi", "Kei Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Kei", "Kenji Fukumizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukumizu:Kenji"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
