{"title": "Monetary Assessment of Battery Life on Smartphones.", "fields": ["battery", "computer science", "shared resource", "simulation"], "abstract": "Research claims that users value the battery life of their smartphones, but no study to date has attempted to quantify battery value and how this value changes according to users' current context and needs. Previous work has quantified the monetary value that smartphone users place on their data (e.g., location), but not on battery life. Here we present a field study and methodology for systematically measuring the monetary value of smartphone battery life, using a reverse second-price sealed-bid auction protocol. Our results show that the prices for the first and last 10% battery segments differ substantially. Our findings also quantify the tradeoffs that users consider in relation to battery, and provide a monetary model that can be used to measure the value of apps and enable fair ad-hoc sharing of smartphone resources.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Simo Hosio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosio:Simo", "Denzil Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Denzil", "Jorge Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Jorge", "Niels van Berkel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berkel:Niels_van", "Chu Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Chu", "Muzamil Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Muzamil", "Huber Flores.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flores:Huber", "Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis"], "pages": 12}
