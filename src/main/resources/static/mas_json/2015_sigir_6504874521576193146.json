In this paper, we investigate the effects of rewarding terms based on their location in sentences on information retrieval. Particularly, we propose a novel Term Location (TEL) retrieval model based on BM25 to enhance probabilistic information retrieval, where a kernel-based method is used to capture term placement patterns. Experiments on five TREC datasets of varied size and content indicate the proposed model significantly outperforms the optimized BM25 and DirichletLM in MAP over all datasets with all kernel functions, and excels the optimized BM25 and DirichletLM over most of the datasets in P@5 and P@20 with different kernel functions.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["York University", "York University", "York University"], "authors": ["Baiyan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Baiyan", "Xiangdong An.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/An:Xiangdong", "Jimmy Xiangji Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jimmy_Xiangji"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
