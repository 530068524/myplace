We will show how Titan can capture both architecture and evolutionary structure and help to bridge the gap between architecture and defect prediction. We will demo how to use our toolset to capture hundreds of buggy files into just a few architecturally related groups, and to reveal architecture issues that contribute to the error-proneness and change-proneness of these groups. Our tool has been used to analyze dozens of large-scale industrial projects, and has demonstrated its ability to provide valuable direction on which parts of the architecture are problematic, and on why, when, and how to refactor.
