{"title": "Modeling Mention, Context and Entity with Neural Networks for Entity Disambiguation.", "fields": ["tensor", "weak entity", "convolutional neural network", "string", "entity linking"], "abstract": "Given a query consisting of a mention (name string) and a background document, entity disambiguation calls for linking the mention to an entity from reference knowledge base like Wikipedia. Existing studies typically use hand-crafted features to represent mention, context and entity, which is laborintensive and weak to discover explanatory factors of data. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a new neural network approach. The model takes consideration of the semantic representations of mention, context and entity, encodes them in continuous vector space and effectively leverages them for entity disambiguation. Specifically, we model variable-sized contexts with convolutional neural network, and embed the positions of context words to factor in the distance between context word and mention. Furthermore, we employ neural tensor network to model the semantic interactions between context and mention. We conduct experiments for entity disambiguation on two benchmark datasets from TAC-KBP 2009 and 2010. Experimental results show that our method yields state-of-the-art performances on both datasets.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yaming Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yaming", "Lei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin_0001:Lei", "Duyu Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Duyu", "Nan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Nan", "Zhenzhou Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Zhenzhou", "Xiaolong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaolong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
