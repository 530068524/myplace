We explore the problem in the context of a network augmented with storage nodes and target at range query. We use bucketing scheme to mix the data for a range, use message encryption for data integrity, and employ encoding numbers to prevent the storage nodes from dropping data.", "citation": "Citations (161)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Bo Sheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheng:Bo", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 5}
