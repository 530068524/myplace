A key contribution of our work is the introduction of novel probabilistic region trajectories, motivated by the non-repeatability of segmentation of frames in a video sequence. Hierarchical image segments are obtained by using a state-of-the-art hierarchical segmentation algorithm, and connected from adjacent frames in a directed acyclic graph. The region trajectories and measures of confidence are extracted from this graph using a dynamic programming-based optimisation. Our second main contribution is a Bayesian framework with a twofold goal: to learn the optimal, in a maximum likelihood sense, Random Forests classifier of motion patterns based on video features, and construct a unique graph from region trajectories of different frames, lengths and hierarchical levels. Finally, we demonstrate the use of Isomap for effective spatio-temporal clustering of the region trajectories of pedestrians. We support our claims with experimental results on new and existing challenging video sequences.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Panasonic", "Panasonic", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Fabio Galasso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galasso:Fabio", "Masahiro Iwasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwasaki:Masahiro", "Kunio Nobori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nobori:Kunio", "Roberto Cipolla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cipolla:Roberto"], "pages": 8}
