{"title": "SampleRank: Training Factor Graphs with Atomic Gradients.", "fields": ["graphical model", "divergence", "factor graph", "coreference", "markov chain monte carlo"], "abstract": "We present SampleRank, an alternative to contrastive divergence (CD) for estimating parameters in complex graphical models. SampleRank harnesses a user-provided loss function to distribute stochastic gradients across an MCMC chain. As a result, parameter updates can be computed between arbitrary MCMC states. SampleRank is not only faster than CD, but also achieves better accuracy in practice (up to 23% error reduction on noun-phrase coreference).", "citation": "Citations (51)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["eBay", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Southeastern Louisiana University", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Michael L.
