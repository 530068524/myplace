The World of sights in your pocket.", "fields": ["landmark", "web service", "mobile computing", "mobile telephony", "sight"], "abstract": "Web 2.0 applications are a rich source of multimedia resources, that describe sights, events, whether conditions, traffic situations and other relevant objects along the user's route. Compared to static sight descriptions, Web 2.0 resources can provide up-to-date visual information, which has been found important or interesting by the other users. Some algorithms have been suggested recently for the landmark finding problem from photos. Still, if users want related videos or background information about a particular place of interest it is necessary to contact different social platforms or general search engines. In this paper we present GuideMe! - a mobile application that automatically identifies landmark tags from Flickr groups and gathers relevant sightseeing resources from various Web 2.0 social platforms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Leibniz University of Hanover", "Leibniz University of Hanover", "Leibniz University of Hanover"], "authors": ["Sergej Zerr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zerr:Sergej", "Kerstin Bischoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischoff:Kerstin", "Sergey Chernov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chernov_0001:Sergey"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
