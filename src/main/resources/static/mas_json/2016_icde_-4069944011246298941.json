GEOSPARK consists of three main layers: Apache Spark Layer, Spatial RDD Layer and Spatial Query Processing Layer. Apache Spark Layer provides basic Apache Spark functionalities as regular RDD operations. Spatial RDD Layer consists of three novel Spatial Resilient Distributed Datasets (SRDDs) which extend regular Apache Spark RDD to support geometrical and spatial objects with data partitioning and indexing. Spatial Query Processing Layer executes spatial queries (e.g., Spatial Join) on SRDDs. The dynamic status of SRDDs and spatial operations are visualized by GEOSPARK monitoring map interface. We demonstrate GEOSPARK using three spatial analytics applications (spatial aggregation, autocorrelation and co-location) to show how users can easily define their spatial analytics tasks and efficiently process such tasks on large-scale spatial data at interactive performance.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Jia Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jia", "Jinxuan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jinxuan", "Mohamed Sarwat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarwat:Mohamed"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
