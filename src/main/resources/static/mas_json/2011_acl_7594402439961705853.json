{"title": "Automatically Extracting Polarity-Bearing Topics for Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification.", "fields": ["prior probability", "bearing", "feature vector", "dirichlet distribution", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Joint sentiment-topic (JST) model was previously proposed to detect sentiment and topic simultaneously from text. The only supervision required by JST model learning is domain-independent polarity word priors. In this paper, we modify the JST model by incorporating word polarity priors through modifying the topic-word Dirichlet priors. We study the polarity-bearing topics extracted by JST and show that by augmenting the original feature space with polarity-bearing topics, the in-domain supervised classifiers learned from augmented feature representation achieve the state-of-the-art performance of 95% on the movie review data and an average of 90% on the multi-domain sentiment dataset. Furthermore, using feature augmentation and selection according to the information gain criteria for cross-domain sentiment classification, our proposed approach performs either better or comparably compared to previous approaches. Nevertheless, our approach is much simpler and does not require difficult parameter tuning.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Open University", "University of Exeter", "Open University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yulan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yulan", "Chenghua Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chenghua", "Harith Alani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alani:Harith"], "pages": 9}
