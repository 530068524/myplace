In this paper, we investigate both classic and parameterized computational complexity of electoral campaign management under such rules. We focus on two methods that can be used to promote a given candidate: asking voters to move this candidate upwards in their preference order or asking them to change the number of candidates they approve of. We show that finding an optimal campaign management strategy of the first type is easy for both Bucklin and Fallback. In contrast, the second method is computationally hard even if the degree to which we need to affect the votes is small. Nevertheless, we identify a large class of scenarios that admit fixed-parameter tractable algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "University of Oxford", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "AGH University of Science and Technology", "Nanyang Technological University", "AGH University, ...
