{"title": "FlexiWeb: Network-Aware Compaction for Accelerating Mobile Web Transfers.", "fields": ["fold", "mobile web", "web page", "lossless compression", "middlebox"], "abstract": "To reduce page load times and bandwidth usage for mobile web browsing, middleboxes that compress page content are commonly used today. Unfortunately, this can hurt performance in many cases; via an extensive measurement study, we show that using middleboxes to facilitate compression results in up to 28% degradation in page load times when the client enjoys excellent wireless link conditions. We find that benefits from compression are primarily realized under bad network conditions. Guided by our study, we design and implement FlexiWeb, a framework that determines both when to use a middlebox and how to use it, based on the client's network conditions. First, FlexiWeb selectively fetches objects on a web page either directly from the source or via a middlebox, rather than fetching all objects via the middlebox. Second, instead of simply performing lossless compression of all content, FlexiWeb performs network-aware compression of images by selecting from among a range of content transformations. We implement and evaluate a prototype of FlexiWeb using Google's open source Chromium mobile browser and our implementation of a modified version of Google's open source compression proxy. Our extensive experiments show that, across a range of scenarios, FlexiWeb reduces page load times for mobile clients by 35-42% compared to the status quo.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of Michigan", "University of California, Riverside", "USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Shailendra Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh_0004:Shailendra", "Harsha V.
