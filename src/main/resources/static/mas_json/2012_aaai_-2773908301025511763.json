{"title": "Multi-Label Learning by Exploiting Label Correlations Locally.", "fields": ["data set", "exploit", "machine learning", "pattern recognition", "correlation"], "abstract": "It is well known that exploiting label correlations is important for multi-label learning. Existing approaches typically exploit label correlations globally, by assuming that the label correlations are shared by all the instances. In real-world tasks, however, different instances may share different label correlations, and few correlations are globally applicable. In this paper, we propose the ML-LOC approach which allows label correlations to be exploited locally. To encode the local influence of label correlations, we derive a LOC code to enhance the feature representation of each instance. The global discrimination fitting and local correlation sensitivity are incorporated into a unified framework, and an alternating solution is developed for the optimization. Experimental results on a number of image, text and gene data sets validate the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (152)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Sheng-Jun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Sheng=Jun", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
