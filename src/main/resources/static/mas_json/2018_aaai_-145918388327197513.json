{"title": "StarSpace: Embed All The Things!", "fields": ["ranking", "graph", "embedding", "collaborative filtering", "sentence"], "abstract": "We present StarSpace, a general-purpose neural embedding model that can solve a wide variety of problems: labeling tasks such as text classification, ranking tasks such as information retrieval/web search, collaborative filtering-based or content-based recommendation, embedding of multi-relational graphs, and learning word, sentence or document level embeddings. In each case the model works by embedding those entities comprised of discrete features and comparing them against each other -- learning similarities dependent on the task. Empirical results on a number of tasks show that StarSpace is highly competitive with existing methods, whilst also being generally applicable to new cases where those methods are not.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "authors": ["Ledell Yu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ledell_Yu", "Adam Fisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fisch:Adam", "Sumit Chopra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chopra:Sumit", "Keith Adams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adams:Keith", "Antoine Bordes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bordes:Antoine", "Jason Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Jason"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
