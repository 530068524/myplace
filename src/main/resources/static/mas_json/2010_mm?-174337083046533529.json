With the OCI model, we first localize faces from images captured in arbitrary views, and then determine the most distinctive features. Relationships between feature points and the invariant vector are described in terms of geometry and appearance information, in the form of a probabilistic model. In contrast to previous works on age classification/estimation, we emphasize that this method is especially useful for faces captured in real-world situations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National Chung Cheng University", "National Chung Cheng University", "Industrial Technology Research Institute"], "authors": ["Wei-Ta Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Wei=Ta", "Wen-Long Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wen=Long", "Jen-Yu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jen=Yu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
