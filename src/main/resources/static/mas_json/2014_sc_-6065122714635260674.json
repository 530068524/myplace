{"title": "A Study on Balancing Parallelism, Data Locality, and Recomputation in Existing PDE Solvers.", "fields": ["multi core processor", "locality", "grid", "copying", "solver"], "abstract": "Structured-grid PDE solver frameworks parallelize over boxes, which are rectangular domains of cells or faces in a structured grid. In the Chombo framework, the box sizes are typically 16 3  or 32 3 , but larger box sizes such as 128 3  would result in less surface area and therefore less storage, copying, and/or ghost cells communication overhead. Unfortunately, current on-node parallelization schemes perform poorly for these larger box sizes. In this paper, we investigate 30 different inter-loop optimization strategies and demonstrate the parallel scaling advantages of some of these variants on NUMA multicore nodes. Shifted, fused, and communication-avoiding variants for 128 3  boxes result in close to ideal parallel scaling and come close to matching the performance of   16 3  boxes on three different multicore systems for a benchmark that is a proxy for program idioms found in Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) codes.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Colorado State University", "Colorado State University", "Colorado State University", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Catherine Mills Olschanowsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olschanowsky:Catherine_Mills", "Michelle Mills Strout.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strout:Michelle_Mills", "Stephen M.
