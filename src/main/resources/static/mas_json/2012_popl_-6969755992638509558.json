{"title": "Canonicity for 2-dimensional type theory.", "fields": ["type class", "algebraic data type", "option type", "recursive data type", "type conversion"], "abstract": "Higher-dimensional dependent type theory enriches conventional one-dimensional dependent type theory with additional structure expressing equivalence of elements of a type. This structure may be employed in a variety of ways to capture rather coarse identifications of elements, such as a universe of sets considered modulo isomorphism. Equivalence must be respected by all families of types and terms, as witnessed computationally by a type-generic program. Higher-dimensional type theory has applications to code reuse for dependently typed programming, and to the formalization of mathematics. In this paper, we develop a novel judgemental formulation of a two-dimensional type theory, which enjoys a canonicity property: a closed term of boolean type is definitionally equal to true or false. Canonicity is a necessary condition for a computational interpretation of type theory as a programming language, and does not hold for existing axiomatic presentations of higher-dimensional type theory. The method of proof is a generalization of the NuPRL semantics, interpreting types as syntactic groupoids rather than equivalence relations.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Daniel R.
