Our work is based on transductive experimental design (TED), an active learning formulation that effectively explores the information of unlabeled data. Despite its appealing properties, the optimization problem is however NP-hard and thus--like most of other active learning methods--a greedy sequential strategy to select one data example after another was suggested to find a suboptimum. In this paper we formulate the problem into a continuous optimization problem and prove its convexity, meaning that a set of data examples can be selected with a guarantee of global optimum. We also develop an iterative algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem, which turns out to be very easy-to-implement. Our text categorization experiments on two text corpora empirically demonstrated that the new active learning algorithm outperforms the sequential greedy algorithm, and is promising for active text categorization applications.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["NEC Laboratorie ...
