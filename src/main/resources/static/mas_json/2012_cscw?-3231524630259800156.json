Activities (movement and face-to-face interaction) and creativity of one five-member and two seven-member teams were tracked for twenty-five days, eleven days, and fifteen days respectively. Paired-sample t-test confirmed average daily movement energy during creative days was significantly greater than on non-creative days and that face-to-face interaction tie strength of team members during creative days was significantly greater than for non-creative days. The combined approach of principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) conducted on movement and face-to-face interaction data yielded a model that predicted creativity with 87.5% and 91% accuracy, respectively. Computational models that predict team creativity hold particular promise to enhance Creativity Support Tools.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Priyamvada Tripathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tripathi:Priyamvada", "Winslow Burleson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burleson:Winslow"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
