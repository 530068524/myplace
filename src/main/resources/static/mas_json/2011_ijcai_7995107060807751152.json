While existing ensembles for coreference resolution are typically created using different learning algorithms, clustering algorithms or training sets, we harness recent advances in coreference modeling and propose to create our ensemble from a variety of supervised coreference models. However, the presence of pairwise and non-pairwise coreference models in our ensemble presents a challenge to its application: it is not immediately clear how to combine the coreference decisions made by these models. We investigate different methods for applying a model-heterogeneous ensemble for coreference resolution. Empirical results on the ACE data sets demonstrate the promise of ensemble approaches: all ensemble-based systems significantly outperform the best member of the ensemble.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Altaf Rahman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahman:Altaf", "Vincent Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Vincent"], "pages": 6}
