{"title": "Trajectory Outlier Detection: A Partition-and-Detect Framework.", "fields": ["line segment", "anomaly detection", "partition", "trajectory", "outlier"], "abstract": "Outlier detection has been a popular data mining task. However, there is a lack of serious study on outlier detection for trajectory data. Even worse, an existing trajectory outlier detection algorithm has limited capability to detect outlying sub- trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel partition-and-detect framework for trajectory outlier detection, which partitions a trajectory into a set of line segments, and then, detects outlying line segments for trajectory outliers. The primary advantage of this framework is to detect outlying sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-detect framework, we develop a trajectory outlier detection algorithm TRAOD. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and detection. For the first phase, we propose a two-level trajectory partitioning strategy that ensures both high quality and high efficiency. For the second phase, we present a hybrid of the distance-based and density-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that TRAOD correctly detects outlying sub-trajectories from real trajectory data.", "citation": "Citations (354)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Jae-Gil Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Jae=Gil", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "Xiaolei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiaolei"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
