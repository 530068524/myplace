Our motivation is the increasing prevalence of wearable cameras, some of which can also capture WLAN data. We propose to use image-based and WLAN-based localization individually and then fuse the results to obtain better performance overall. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our fusion algorithm for localisation to within a 8.9m 2  room on very challenging data both for WLAN and image-based algorithms. We envisage the potential usefulness of our approach in a range of ambient assisted living applications.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Dublin City University", "Dublin City University", "Dublin City University"], "authors": ["Milan D.
