{"title": "A hybrid sampler for Poisson-Kingman mixture models.", "fields": ["prior probability", "nonparametric statistics", "markov chain monte carlo", "mixture model", "poisson distribution"], "abstract": "This paper concerns the introduction of a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models with priors that belong to the general Poisson-Kingman class. We present a novel compact way of representing the infinite dimensional component of the model such that while explicitly representing this infinite component it has less memory and storage requirements than previous MCMC schemes. We describe comparative simulation results demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed MCMC algorithm against existing marginal and conditional MCMC samplers.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University College London", "Collegio Carlo Alberto", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Maria Lomeli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lomeli:Maria", "Stefano Favaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Favaro:Stefano", "Yee Whye Teh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teh:Yee_Whye"], "pages": 9}
