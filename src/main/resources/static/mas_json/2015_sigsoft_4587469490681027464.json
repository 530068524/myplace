This work provides an efficient execution model and implementation for SCOOP, a concurrency approach that provides not only data-race freedom but also pre/postcondition reasoning guarantees between threads. The extensions we propose influence the underlying semantics to increase the amount of concurrent execution that is possible, exclude certain classes of deadlocks, and enable greater performance.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Google", "ETH Zurich", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Scott West.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/West:Scott", "Sebastian Nanz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanz:Sebastian", "Bertrand Meyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyer_0001:Bertrand"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
