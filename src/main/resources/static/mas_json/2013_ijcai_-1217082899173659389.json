{"title": "Monte-Carlo Expectation Maximization for Decentralized POMDPs.", "fields": ["monte carlo method", "maximum likelihood", "expectation maximization algorithm", "scalability", "sampling"], "abstract": "We address two significant drawbacks of state-of-the-art solvers of decentralized POMDPs (DECPOMDPs): the reliance on complete knowledge of the model and limited scalability as the complexity of the domain grows. We extend a recently proposed approach for solving DEC-POMDPs via a reduction to the maximum likelihood problem, which in turn can be solved using EM. We introduce a model-free version of this approach that employs Monte-Carlo EM (MCEM). While a naive implementation of MCEM is inadequate in multiagent settings, we introduce several improvements in sampling that produce high-quality results on a variety of DEC-POMDP benchmarks, including large problems with thousands of agents.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Southampton"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Feng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Feng", "Shlomo Zilberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zilberstein:Shlomo", "Nicholas R.
