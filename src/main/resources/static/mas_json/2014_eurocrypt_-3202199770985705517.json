{"title": "Distributed Point Functions and Their Applications.", "fields": ["mathematics", "discrete mathematics", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "For x,y \u2208 {0,1}*, the point function P x,y is defined by P x,y (x) = y and P x,y (x\u2032) = 0|y| for all x\u2032 \u2260 x. We introduce the notion of a distributed point function (DPF), which is a keyed function family F k with the following property. Given x,y specifying a point function, one can efficiently generate a key pair (k 0,k 1) such that: (1) \\(F_{k_0}\\oplus F_{k_1}=P_{x,y}\\), and (2) each of k 0 and k 1 hides x and y. Our main result is an efficient construction of a DPF under the (minimal) assumption that a one-way function exists.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Niv Gilboa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilboa:Niv", "Yuval Ishai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishai:Yuval"], "pages": 19}
