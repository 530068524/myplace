This class includes important families of entropy, divergence, mutual information, and their conditional versions. For densities on the d-dimensional unit cube [0,1]d that lie in a \u03b2-Holder smoothness class, we prove our estimator converges at the rate O(n-\u03b2/ \u03b2+d). Furthermore, we prove the estimator is exponentially concentrated about its mean, whereas most previous related results have proven only expected error bounds on estimators.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shashank Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh_0005:Shashank", "Barnab\u00e1s P\u00f3czos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=oacute=czos:Barnab=aacute=s"], "pages": 9}
