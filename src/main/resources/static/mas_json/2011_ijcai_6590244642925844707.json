An A* search algorithm is introduced to solve the problem. With the guidance of a consistent heuristic, the algorithm learns an optimal Bayesian network by only searching the most promising parts of the solution space. Empirical results show that the A* search algorithm significantly improves the time and space efficiency of existing methods on a set of benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Mississippi State University", "Mississippi State University", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Changhe Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Changhe", "Brandon M.
