We analyze the trade off between saying \"I don't know\" and making mistakes. If the number of don't-know predictions is required to be zero, the model reduces to the well-known mistake-bound model introduced by Littlestone [Lit88]. On the other hand, if no mistakes are allowed, the model reduces to KWIK framework introduced by Li et. al. [LLW08]. We propose a general, though inefficient, algorithm for general finite concept classes that minimizes the number of don't-know predictions subject to a given bound on the number of allowed mistakes. We then present specific polynomial-time algorithms for the concept classes of monotone disjunctions and linear separators with a margin.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Amin Sayedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sayedi:Amin", "Morteza Zadimoghaddam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zadimoghaddam:Morteza", "Avrim Blum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blum:Avrim"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
