Without an exact knowledge of the interference structure, it can be challenging to understand which partitioning of the experimental units is optimal to minimize the estimation bias. In the paper, we introduce a monotonicity condition under which a novel two-stage experimental design allows us to determine which of two cluster-based designs yields the least biased estimator. We then consider the setting of online advertising auctions and show that reserve price experiments satisfy the monotonicity condition and the proposed framework and methodology apply. We validate our findings on an advertising auction dataset.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Google", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Jean Pouget-Abadie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pouget=Abadie:Jean", "Vahab S.
