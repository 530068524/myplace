{"title": "Displayed Uncertainty Improves Driving Experience and Behavior: The Case of Range Anxiety in an Electric Car.", "fields": ["instrumentation", "range anxiety", "feeling", "electric vehicle", "ambiguity"], "abstract": "We explore the impact of the displayed precision of instrumentation estimates of range and state-of-charge on drivers' attitudes towards an all-electric vehicle (EV), on their driving experience, and driving behavior under varying conditions of resource availability. Participants (N=73) completed a 19-mile long drive through highway, rural town and mountain road conditions in an EV that displayed high vs. low remaining range, and gave estimates of that range with high and low information ambiguity. We found that an ambiguous display of range preserved drivers' feelings of trust towards the vehicle, despite encountering situations intended to induce severe range anxiety. Furthermore, compared to drivers facing an unambiguous display of range, drivers presented with an ambiguous range display reported improved driving experience, and exhibited driving behavior better adapted to road and remaining range conditions.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Malte F.
