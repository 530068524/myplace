{"title": "Incentivizing crowdsourcing systems with network effects.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "intrinsic value", "social network", "business", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "In a crowdsourcing system, it is important for the crowdsourcer to engineer extrinsic rewards to incentivize the participants. With mobile social networking, a user enjoys an intrinsic benefit when she aligns her behavior with the behavior of others. Referred to as network effects, such an intrinsic benefit becomes more significant as the number of users grows in the crowdsourcing system. But should a crowdsourcer design her extrinsic rewards differently when such network effects are taken into account? In this paper, we, for the first time, consider network effects as a contributing factor to intrinsic rewards, and study its influence on the design of extrinsic rewards. Rather than assuming a fixed participant population, we show that the number of participating users evolves to a steady equilibrium, thanks to subtle interactions between intrinsic rewards due to network effects and extrinsic rewards offered by the crowdsourcer. Taken network effects into consideration, we design progressively more sophisticated extrinsic reward mechanisms, and propose new and optimal strategies for a crowdsourcer to obtain a higher utility. Via extensive simulations, we demonstrate that with our new strategies, a crowdsourcer is able to attract more participants with higher contributed efforts; and participants gain higher utilities from both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Yanjiao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yanjiao", "Baochun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baochun", "Qian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
