Here we extend web interfaces designed explicitly for novice users to integrate streaming video with 3D GIS, and work to dramatically simplify the task of retexturing 3D scenes from live imagery. We also derive and implement constraints to use corresponding points to calibrate popular pan-tilt-zoom webcams with respect to GIS applications, so that the calibration is automatically updated as web users adjust the camera zoom and view direction. These contributions are demonstrated in a live web application implemented on the Google Earth Plug-in, within which hundreds of users have already geo-registered streaming cameras in hundreds of scenes to create live, updating textures in 3D scenes.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "authors": ["Austin Abrams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abrams:Austin", "Robert Pless.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pless:Robert"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
