Currently, limited software mechanisms exist for managing ergonomics; the most well-known are \"break-reminder\" packages that schedule and recommend typing breaks. Yet despite the proven benefits of taking breaks, such packages are rarely adopted due to the over-head of introducing periodic interruptions into a user's workflow. In this paper, we describe  SuperBreak , a break-reminder package that provides hands-free interactions during breaks, with the goal of encouraging users to take more breaks and enhancing the benefits of those breaks. In a field study of 26 knowledge workers, 85% preferred SuperBreak over a traditional break-reminder system, and on average participants took a higher percentage of the interactive breaks suggested to them. Our results highlight the value of interactivity for improving the adoption and retention of ergonomic break practices.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dan Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Dan", "A.
