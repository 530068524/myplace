A tremendous amount of real users of intelligent assistants provide us with an opportunity to explore a novel task of predicting whether users will continually use their intelligent assistants in the future. We developed prediction models of prospective user engagement by using large-scale user logs obtained from a commercial intelligent assistant. Experiments demonstrated that our models can predict prospective user engagement reasonably well, and outperforms a strong baseline that makes prediction based past utterance frequency.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Tokyo"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shumpei Sano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sano:Shumpei", "Nobuhiro Kaji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaji:Nobuhiro", "Manabu Sassano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sassano:Manabu"], "pages": -1}
