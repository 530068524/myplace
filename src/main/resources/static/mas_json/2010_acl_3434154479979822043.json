We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional class-based approaches, it produces human-interpretable classes describing each relation's preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power.\n\nWe compare LDA-SP to several state-of-the-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007). We also evaluate LDA-SP's effectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement over Pantel et al.'s system (Pantel et al., 2007).", "citation": "Citations (168)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Alan Ritter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ritter:Alan", "Mausam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mausam:", "Oren Etzioni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etzioni:Oren"], "pages": 11}
