{"title": "GIAnT: Visualizing Group Interaction at Large Wall Displays.", "fields": ["timeline", "multimedia", "visualization", "extensibility", "territoriality"], "abstract": "Large interactive displays are increasingly important and a relevant research topic, and several studies have focused on wall interaction. However, in many cases, thorough user studies currently require time-consuming video analysis and coding. We present the Group Interaction Analysis Toolkit GIAnT, which provides a rich set of visualizations supporting investigation of multi-user interaction at large display walls. GIAnT focuses on visualizing time periods, making it possible to gain overview-level insights quickly. The toolkit is designed to be extensible and features several carefully crafted visualizations: A novel timeline visualization shows movement in front of the wall over time, a wall visualization shows interactions on the wall and gaze data, and a floor visualization displays user positions. In addition, GIAnT shows the captured video stream along with basic statistics. We validate our tool by analyzing how it supports investigating major research topics and by practical use in evaluating a cooperative game.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ulrich von Zadow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zadow:Ulrich_von", "Raimund Dachselt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dachselt:Raimund"], "pages": 9}
