{"title": "The Fun and the Serious in an Educational Game: The Monkey Tales Case.", "fields": ["video game design", "game mechanics", "game design", "game art design", "simulation"], "abstract": "We describe a study of Monkey Tales, an educational game targeted at primary school children. Starting from the assumption that all meaning is socially constructed, we focus our attention on the way an educational game, and its balance between fun and serious aspects, is constructed in public texts (game manufacturer's communication and game reviews) and in individual use (the way players and their parents talk about the game). Through an analysis of public texts and individual use, we show how the balance between the fun and the serious in Monkey Tales is constructed in different ways.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jan Derboven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Derboven:Jan", "Bieke Zaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaman:Bieke", "Jorick Vissers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vissers:Jorick", "David Geerts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geerts:David", "Dirk De Grooff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grooff:Dirk_De"], "pages": 4}
