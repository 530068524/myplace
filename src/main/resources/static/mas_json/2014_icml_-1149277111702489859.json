In this work, we model such data as generated by a latent collection of continuous-time binary semi-Markov processes, corresponding to external events appearing and disappearing. A continuous-time modeling framework is more appropriate for multichannel point process data than a binning approach requiring time discretization, and we show connections between our model and recent ideas from the discrete-time literature. We describe an efficient MCMC algorithm for posterior inference, and apply our ideas to both synthetic data and a real-world biometrics application.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Technicolor", "Duke University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Wenzhao Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Wenzhao", "Vinayak Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Vinayak", "Brian Eriksson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eriksson:Brian", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "pages": 9}
