{"title": "Global Seismic Monitoring: A Bayesian Approach.", "fields": ["data mining", "bayesian probability", "machine learning", "inference", "wireless sensor network"], "abstract": "The automated processing of multiple seismic signals to detect and localize seismic events is a central tool in both geophysics and nuclear treaty verification. This paper reports on a project, begun in 2009, to reformulate this problem in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian seismic monitoring system, NET-VISA, has been built comprising a spatial event prior and generative models of event transmission and detection, as well as an inference algorithm. Applied in the context of the International Monitoring System (IMS), a global sensor network developed for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), NET-VISA achieves a reduction of around 60% in the number of missed events compared to the currently deployed system. It also finds events that are missed even by the human analysts who post-process the IMS output.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Brown University"], "authors": ["Nimar S.
