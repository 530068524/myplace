However, these counters often barely fit into on-chip SRAM memories. Past papers have proposed using counter estimators instead, thus trading off counter precision for a lower number of bits. But these estimators do not achieve optimal estimation error, and cannot always scale to arbitrary counter values.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Qualcomm", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Erez Tsidon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsidon:Erez", "Iddo Hanniel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanniel:Iddo", "Isaac Keslassy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keslassy:Isaac"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
