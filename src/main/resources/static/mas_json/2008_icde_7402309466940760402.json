{"title": "Greedy List Intersection.", "fields": ["xml", "conjunctive query", "approximation algorithm", "tree", "greedy algorithm"], "abstract": "A common technique for processing conjunctive queries is to first match each predicate separately using an index lookup, and then compute the intersection of the resulting row- id lists, via an AND-tree. The performance of this technique depends crucially on the order of lists in this tree: it is important to compute early the intersections that will produce small results. But this optimization is hard to do when the data or predicates have correlation. We present a new algorithm for ordering the lists in an AND- tree by sampling the intermediate intersection sizes. We prove that our algorithm is near-optimal and validate its effectiveness experimentally on datasets with a variety of distributions.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Google", "IBM", "State University of New York System"], "authors": ["Robert Krauthgamer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krauthgamer:Robert", "Aranyak Mehta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehta:Aranyak", "Vijayshankar Raman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raman:Vijayshankar", "Atri Rudra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudra:Atri"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
