{"title": "Online Graph Planarisation for Synchronous Parsing of Semantic and Syntactic Dependencies.", "fields": ["probabilistic latent semantic analysis", "syntactic predicate", "generative grammar", "planar graph", "f1 score"], "abstract": "This paper investigates a generative history-based parsing model that synchronises the derivation of non-planar graphs representing semantic dependencies with the derivation of dependency trees representing syntactic structures. To process non-planarity online, the semantic transition-based parser uses a new technique to dynamically reorder nodes during the derivation. While the synchronised derivations allow different structures to be built for the semantic non-planar graphs and syntactic dependency trees, useful statistical dependencies between these structures are modeled using latent variables. The resulting synchronous parser achieves competitive performance on the CoNLL- 2008 shared task, achieving relative error reduction of 12% in semantic F score over previously proposed synchronous models that cannot process non-planarity online.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Geneva", "University of Geneva", "University of Geneva"], "authors": ["Ivan Titov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Titov:Ivan", "James Henderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henderson:James", "Paola Merlo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Merlo:Paola", "Gabriele Musillo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Musillo:Gabriele"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
