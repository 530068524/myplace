The main result is a polynomial time algorithm for context matching with dags, when the number of different context variables is fixed for the problem. NP-completeness is obtained when the terms are represented using the more general formalism of singleton tree grammars. As an ingredient of this proof, we also show that the special case of first-order matching with singleton tree grammars is decidable in polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["LSI Dept., Univ ... unya, Barcelona", "LSI Dept., Univ ... unya, Barcelona"], "authors": ["Adri\u00e0 Gasc\u00f3n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gasc=oacute=n:Adri=agrave=", "Guillem Godoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Godoy:Guillem", "Manfred Schmidt-Schau\u00df.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt=Schau=szlig=:Manfred"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
