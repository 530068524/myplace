{"title": "Remote Collaboration With Mixed Reality Displays: How Shared Virtual Landmarks Facilitate Spatial Referencing.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "user experience design", "multimedia", "mixed reality", "provisioning"], "abstract": "HCI research has demonstrated Mixed Reality (MR) as being beneficial for co-located collaborative work. For remote collaboration, however, the collaborators' visual contexts do not coincide due to their individual physical environments. The problem becomes apparent when collaborators refer to physical landmarks in their individual environments to guide each other's attention. In an experimental study with 16 dyads, we investigated how the provisioning of shared virtual landmarks (SVLs) influences communication behavior and user experience. A quantitative analysis revealed that participants used significantly less ambiguous spatial expressions and reported an improved user experience when SVLs were provided. Based on these findings and a qualitative video analysis we provide implications for the design of MRs to facilitate remote collaboration.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Konstanz", "Aarhus University", "University of Konstanz"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jens M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:Jens", "Roman R\u00e4dle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=dle:Roman", "Harald Reiterer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reiterer:Harald"], "pages": 6}
