Rather than using approximate inference or tailoring a specialized inference method for a particular structure\u2014standard responses to the scaling challenge\u2014 we propose to embed prediction constraints directly into the learned representation. By eliminating the need for explicit inference a more scalable approach to structured output prediction can be achieved, particularly at test time. We demonstrate the idea for multi-label prediction under subsumption and mutual exclusion constraints, where a relationship to maximum margin structured output prediction can be established. Experiments demonstrate that the benefits of structured output training can still be realized even after inference has been eliminated.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "Google", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Farzaneh Mirzazadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirzazadeh:Farzaneh", "Siamak Ravanbakhsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravanbakhsh:Siamak", "Nan Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Nan", "Dale Schuurmans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuurmans:Dale"], "pages": 9}
