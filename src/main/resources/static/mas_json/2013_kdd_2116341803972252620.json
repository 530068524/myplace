{"title": "A data mining driven risk profiling method for road asset management.", "fields": ["crash", "asset management", "extrapolation", "missing data", "skid", "road surface"], "abstract": "Road surface skid resistance has been shown to have a strong relationship to road crash risk, however, applying the current method of using investigatory levels to identify crash prone roads is problematic as they may fail in identifying risky roads outside of the norm. The proposed method analyses a complex and formerly impenetrable volume of data from roads and crashes using data mining. This method rapidly identifies roads with elevated crash-rate, potentially due to skid resistance deficit, for investigation. A hypothetical skid resistance/crash risk curve is developed for each road segment, driven by the model deployed in a novel regression tree extrapolation method. The method potentially solves the problem of missing skid resistance values which occurs during network-wide crash analysis, and allows risk assessment of the major proportion of roads without skid resistance values.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Roadway Enginee ... bane, Australia"], "authors": ["Daniel Emerson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emerson:Daniel", "Justin Weligamage.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weligamage:Justin", "Richi Nayak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nayak:Richi"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
