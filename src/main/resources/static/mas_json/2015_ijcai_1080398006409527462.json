{"title": "Combining Existential Rules and Description Logics.", "fields": ["existentialism", "arity", "schema", "description logic", "decidability"], "abstract": "Query answering under existential rules -- implications with existential quantifiers in the head -- is known to be decidable when imposing restrictions on the rule bodies such as frontier-guardedness [Baget et al., 2010; 2011a]. Query answering is also decidable for description logics [Baader, 2003], which further allow disjunction and functionality constraints (assert that certain relations are functions); however, they are focused on ER-type schemas, where relations have arity two.\n\nThis work investigates how to get the best of both worlds: having decidable existential rules on arbitrary arity relations, while allowing rich description logics, including functionality constraints, on arity-two relations. We first show negative results on combining such decidable languages. Second, we introduce an expressive set of existential rules (frontier-one rules with a certain restriction) which can be combined with powerful constraints on arity-two relations (e.g. GC2, ALCQIb) while retaining decidable query answering. Further, we provide conditions to add functionality constraints on the higher-arity relations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Antoine Amarilli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amarilli:Antoine", "Michael Benedikt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benedikt:Michael"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
