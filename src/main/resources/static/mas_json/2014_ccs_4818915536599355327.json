We consider speed-record-setting hand-optimized assembly software for Curve25519 elliptic-curve key exchange presented by Bernstein et al. at CHES 2011. Two versions for different microarchitectures are available. We successfully verify the core part of the computation, and reproduce detection of a bug in a previously published edition. An SMT solver supporting array and bit-vector theories is used to establish almost all properties. Remaining properties are verified in a proof assistant with simple rewrite tactics. We also exploit the compositionality of Hoare logic to address the scalability issue. Essential differences between both versions of the software are discussed from a formal-verification perspective.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "University of Michigan", "Kyushu University", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "Academia Sinica"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Yu-Fang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu=Fang", "Chang-Hong Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Chang=Hong", "Hsin-Hung Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Hsin=Hung", "Peter Schwabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwabe:Peter", "Ming-Hsien Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Ming=Hsien", "Bow-Yaw Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Bow=Yaw", "Bo-Yin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Bo=Yin", "Shang-Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shang=Yi"], "pages": 11}
