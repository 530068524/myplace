They provision necessary control states at the device and network nodes to enable data access. However, the current design may suffer from long data access latency even under good radio conditions. The fundamental problem is that, data-plane packet delivery cannot start or resume until all control-plane procedures are completed, and these control procedures run sequentially by design. We show both are more than necessary under popular use cases. We design DPCM, which reduces data access latency through parallel processing approaches and exploiting device-side state replica. We implement DPCM and validate its effectiveness with extensive evaluations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Yuanjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanjie", "Zengwen Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Zengwen", "Chunyi Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Chunyi"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
