{"title": "An efficient distributed algorithm for resource allocation in large-scale coupled systems.", "fields": ["distributed algorithm", "cloud computing", "maximization", "resource allocation", "asynchronous communication"], "abstract": "In modern large-scale systems, fast distributed resource allocation and utility maximization are becoming increasingly important. Traditional solutions to such problems rely on primal/dual decomposition and gradient methods, whose convergence is sensitive to the choice of the stepsize and may not be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of large-scale real-time applications. We propose a new iterative approach to distributed resource allocation in coupled systems. Without complicating message-passing, the new approach is robust to parameter choices and expedites convergence by exploiting problem structures. We theoretically analyze the asynchronous algorithm convergence conditions, and empirically evaluate its benefits in a case of cloud network resource reservation based on real-world data.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Di Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Di", "Baochun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baochun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
