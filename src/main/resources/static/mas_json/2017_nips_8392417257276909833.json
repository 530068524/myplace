{"title": "Probabilistic Models for Integration Error in the Assessment of Functional Cardiac Models.", "fields": ["approximation error", "numerical integration", "confounding", "probabilistic logic", "posterior probability"], "abstract": "This paper studies the numerical computation of integrals, representing estimates or predictions, over the output $f(x)$ of a computational model with respect to a distribution $p(\\mathrm{d}x)$ over uncertain inputs $x$ to the model. For the functional cardiac models that motivate this work, neither $f$ nor $p$ possess a closed-form expression and evaluation of either requires $\\approx$ 100 CPU hours, precluding standard numerical integration methods. Our proposal is to treat integration as an estimation problem, with a joint model for both the a priori unknown function $f$ and the a priori unknown distribution $p$. The result is a posterior distribution over the integral that explicitly accounts for dual sources of numerical approximation error due to a severely limited computational budget. This construction is applied to account, in a statistically principled manner, for the impact of numerical errors that (at present) are confounding factors in functional cardiac model assessment.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "King's College London", "King's College London", "University of Warwick", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Chris J.
