DPS queries are important in many real world applications, such as route recommendation systems, logistics planning, and all kinds of shortest-path-related applications that run on resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we study efficient algorithms for processing DPS queries in large road networks. Four algorithms are proposed with different tradeoffs in terms of DPS quality and query processing time, and the best one is a graph-partitioning based index, called RoadPart, that finds a high quality DPS with short response time. Extensive experiments on large road networks demonstrate the merits of our algorithms, and verify the efficiency of RoadPart for finding a high-quality DPS.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Da Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Da", "James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James", "Wilfred Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Wilfred", "Steven Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Steven"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
