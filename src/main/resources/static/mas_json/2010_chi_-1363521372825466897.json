{"title": "Dandelion: supporting coordinated, collaborative authoring in Wikis.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "knowledge management", "workflow", "multimedia", "dandelion"], "abstract": "Dandelion is a tool that extends wikis to support coordinated, collaborative authoring using a tag-based approach. Specifically, users can insert tags in a wiki page to specify various co-authoring tasks. These tags can then be executed to help drive and manage the collaboration workflow, and provide content-centric collaboration awareness for all the co-authors. Four successful pilot deployments and positive user feedback show the practical value of Dandelion, especially its value in supporting a structured, collaborative authoring process often seen in business settings.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Chang Yan Chi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chi:Chang_Yan", "Michelle X.
