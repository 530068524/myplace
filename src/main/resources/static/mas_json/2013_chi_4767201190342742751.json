Some activities easily exacerbate IAQ, resulting in serious pollution. However, people may not notice such changes because many pollutants are colorless and odorless, while many activities are inconspicuous and routine. We implemented inAir, a system that measures and visualizes IAQ that households appropriate and integrate into everyday life. The research goals of this work include understanding the IAQ dynamics with respect to habitual behaviors and analyzing behavioral and quantitative changes towards improving IAQ by the use of inAir. From our longitudinal study for four months, we found that inAir successfully elicited the reflection upon, and the modification of habitual behaviors for healthy domestic environments, which resulted in the significant improvement of IAQ.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Berkeley", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Sunyoung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sunyoung", "Eric Paulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paulos:Eric", "Jennifer Mankoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mankoff:Jennifer"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
