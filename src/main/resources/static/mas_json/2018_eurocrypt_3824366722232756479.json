Vanilla \\(\\mathsf {RLWE}\\) is the decision dual-\\(\\mathsf {RLWE}\\) variant, consisting in distinguishing from uniform a distribution depending on a secret belonging to the dual \\(\\mathcal {O}_K^{\\vee }\\) of the ring of integers \\(\\mathcal {O}_K\\) of a specified number field K. In primal-\\(\\mathsf {RLWE}\\), the secret instead belongs to \\(\\mathcal {O}_K\\). Both decision dual-\\(\\mathsf {RLWE}\\) and primal-\\(\\mathsf {RLWE}\\) enjoy search counterparts. Also widely used is (search/decision) Polynomial Learning With Errors (\\(\\mathsf {PLWE}\\)), which is not defined using a ring of integers \\(\\mathcal {O}_K\\) of a number field K but a polynomial ring \\(\\mathbb {Z}[x]/f\\) for a monic irreducible \\(f \\in \\mathbb {Z}[x]\\). We show that there exist reductions between all of these six problems that incur limited parameter losses. More precisely: we prove that the (decision/search) dual to primal reduction from Lyubashevsky et al. [EUROCRYPT 2010] and Peikert [SCN 2016] can be implemented with a small error rate growth for all rings (the resulting reduction is non-uniform polynomial time); we extend it to polynomial-time reductions between (decision/search) primal \\(\\mathsf {RLWE}\\) and \\(\\mathsf {PLWE}\\) that work for a family of polynomials f that is exponentially large as a function of \\(\\deg f\\) (the resulting reduction is also non-uniform polynomial time); and we exploit the recent technique from Peikert et al. [STOC 2017] to obtain a search to decision reduction for \\(\\mathsf {RLWE}\\) for arbitrary number fields. The reductions incur error rate increases that depend on intrinsic quantities related to K and f.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Miruna Rosca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosca:Miruna", "Damien Stehl\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stehl=eacute=:Damien", "Alexandre Wallet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wallet:Alexandre"], "pages": 28}
