To search for a specific target video, a KIS query is verbose with many multi-modal attributes. Issuing all search terms to a retrieval engine will confuse the search criteria in different modalities and result in \"topic drift\". We propose decomposing a KIS query into a set of short uni-modal subqueries and issue them to the search index of the corresponding modality features, such as text-based metadata, visualbased high-level features. To do so, we introduce novel syntactic query features and cast the query-to-modality mapping as a classification problem. Retrieval results on the TRECVid 2010 KIS dataset shows that our approach outperforms existing methods by a significant margin.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Institute for I ... pore, Singapore", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Kong-Wah Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Kong=Wah", "Yan-Tao Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yan=Tao", "Lekha Chaisorn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaisorn:Lekha"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
