It implements a dynamic cache management algorithm, which takes account of the hit-rate of computed table and available memory. Experiments on the BDD benchmarks of both combinational circuits and model checking show that CacBDD is more efficient compared with the state-of-the-art BDD package CUDD.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Beijing University of Technology", "Griffith University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Guanfeng Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Guanfeng", "Kaile Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Kaile", "Yanyan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yanyan"], "pages": 6}
