{"title": "MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O.", "fields": ["user space", "exploit", "workload", "scalability", "kernel"], "abstract": "We present MegaPipe, a new API for efficient, scalable network I/O for message-oriented workloads. The design of MegaPipe centers around the abstraction of a channel - a per-core, bidirectional pipe between the kernel and user space, used to exchange both I/O requests and event notifications. On top of the channel abstraction, we introduce three key concepts of MegaPipe: partitioning, lightweight socket (lwsocket), and batching.\n\nWe implement MegaPipe in Linux and adapt memcached and nginx. Our results show that, by embracing a clean-slate design approach, MegaPipe is able to exploit new opportunities for improved performance and ease of programmability. In microbenchmarks on an 8-core server with 64 B messages, MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and 582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modified version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Yahoo!", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Sangjin Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Sangjin", "Scott Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Scott", "Byung-Gon Chun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chun:Byung=Gon", "Sylvia Ratnasamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ratnasamy:Sylvia"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2012", "pages": 14}
