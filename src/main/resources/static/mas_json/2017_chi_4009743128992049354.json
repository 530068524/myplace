However, in these systems, the emotional states of the users are often not communicated properly due to their remoteness from one another. In this paper, we investigate the effects of showing emotional states of one collaborator to the other during an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) gameplay experience. We created two collaborative immersive VR games that display the real-time heart-rate of one player to the other. The two different games elicited different emotions, one joyous and the other scary. We tested the effects of visualizing heart-rate feedback in comparison with conditions where such a feedback was absent. The games had significant main effects on the overall emotional experience.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "Mokpo National University", "University of South Australia"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Arindam Dey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dey:Arindam", "Thammathip Piumsomboon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piumsomboon:Thammathip", "Youngho Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Youngho", "Mark Billinghurst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Billinghurst:Mark"], "pages": 12}
