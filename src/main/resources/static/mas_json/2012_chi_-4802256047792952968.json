Many ungrounded force-feedback devices rely on the gyro effect to produce torques on the human body, but their active control systems render them extremely bulky for implementation in small mobile devices. We present GyroTab, a relatively flat handheld system that utilizes the gyro effect to provide torque feedback. GyroTab relies on the user to produce an input torque and provides feedback by opposing that torque, making its feedback  reactive  to the user's motion. We describe the implementation of GyroTab, discuss the kinds of feedback it generates, and explore some of the psychophysical results we obtained from a study with the device.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Washington", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Akash Badshah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badshah:Akash", "Sidhant Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Sidhant", "Daniel Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris_0001:Daniel", "Shwetak Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Shwetak", "Desney S.
