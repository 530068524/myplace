Although being effective on plain documents, conventional text embedding methods suffer from information loss if directly adapted to hyper-documents. In this paper, we propose a general embedding approach for hyper-documents, namely, hyperdoc2vec, along with four criteria characterizing necessary information that hyper-document embedding models should preserve. Systematic comparisons are conducted between hyperdoc2vec and several competitors on two tasks, i.e., paper classification and citation recommendation, in the academic paper domain. Analyses and experiments both validate the superiority of hyperdoc2vec to other models w.r.t. the four criteria.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Tencent", "Tencent"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jialong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jialong", "Yan Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yan", "Wayne Xin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wayne_Xin", "Shuming Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Shuming", "Haisong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haisong"], "pages": 11}
