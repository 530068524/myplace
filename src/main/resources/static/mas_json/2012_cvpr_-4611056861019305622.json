Different from previous techniques, such as sliding window-based or segmentation-based schemes for detecting salient objects, we propose to use a learning approach, random forest in our solution. Our algorithm exploits global features from multiple saliency indicators to directly predict the existence and the position of the salient object. To validate our algorithm, we constructed a large image database collected from Bing image search, that contains hundreds of thousands of manually labeled web images. The experimental results using this new database and the resized MSRA database [16] demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Peking University", "Microsoft", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Peng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Peng", "Jingdong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingdong", "Gang Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Gang", "Jie Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jie", "Hongbin Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongbin", "Shipeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shipeng"], "pages": 8}
