We now release the pre-processed data of a 3-month period for research into user navigation behavior. We preprocessed the data so that only successful GET requests of web pages by non-bot users are kept. The resulting 3-month collection comprises 9.6M page visits (190K unique URLs) by 744K unique visitors.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "authors": ["Suzan Verberne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verberne:Suzan", "Bram Arends.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arends:Bram", "Wessel Kraaij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraaij:Wessel", "Arjen P. de Vries.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vries:Arjen_P=_de"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
