Initially, designers critically reflect on their own assumptions about how a design may affect social and individual behavior. Then, designers use these assumptions as stimuli to elicit other people's points of view. This process of critical self-reflection and evaluation helps the designer to assess the fit between a design and its intended social context of use. To demonstrate the utility of HCI-Q for research and design, we use HCI-Q to explore stakeholders' responses to a prototype Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) application called  Vid2Speech . We show that our adaptation of Q-methodology is useful for revealing the structure of consensus and conflict among stakeholder perspectives, helping to situate design within the context of relevant value tensions and norms.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Kathleen O'Leary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Leary:Kathleen", "Jacob O.
