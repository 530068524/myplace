These applications often require ongoing, dynamic load balancing in order to maintain efficiency. Scalable dynamic load balancing on large clusters is a challenging problem which can be addressed with distributed dynamic load balancing systems. Work stealing is a popular approach to distributed dynamic load balancing; however its performance on large-scale clusters is not well understood. Prior work on work stealing has largely focused on shared memory machines. In this work we investigate the design and scalability of work stealing on modern distributed memory systems. We demonstrate high efficiency and low overhead when scaling to 8,192 processors for three benchmark codes: a producer-consumer benchmark, the unbalanced tree search benchmark, and a multiresolution analysis kernel.", "citation": "Citations (262)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Pennsylvania State University", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Pennsylvania State University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Renaissance Computing Institute", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Intel", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["James Dinan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinan:James", "D.
