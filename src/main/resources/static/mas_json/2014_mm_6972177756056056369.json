We propose virtual portraitist-a new method that helps users take good selfies in angle. Dissimilar to current solutions that mostly use a post-processing step to fix a photograph, the proposed method enables a novel function of recommending a good look before the photo is captured. This is achieved by using an automatic approach for estimating the aesthetic quality score of a selfie based on angle. In particular, a set of distinctive patterns discovered from a collection of online profile pictures are combined with head pose and camera orientation to rate the quality of a selfie. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["National Taiwan Normal University", "National Taiwan Normal University"], "authors": ["Mei-Chen Yeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeh:Mei=Chen", "Hsiao-Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Hsiao=Wei"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
