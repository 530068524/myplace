We allow for any number and types of structures, and any statistical model. We consider the general class of M-estimators that minimize the sum of any loss function, and an instance of what we call a \"hybrid\" regularization, that is the infimal convolution of weighted regularization functions, one for each structural component. We provide corollaries showcasing our unified framework for varied statistical models such as linear regression, multiple regression and principal component analysis, over varied superposition structures.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Eunho Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Eunho", "Pradeep Ravikumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravikumar:Pradeep"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
