FCA provides a way of displaying and interpreting such relationships via concept lattices. We explore the effects of neural code sparsity on the lattice. We then analyze neurophysiological data from high-level visual cortical area STSa, using an exact Bayesian approach to construct the formal context needed by FCA. Prominent features of the resulting concept lattices are discussed, including hierarchical face representation and indications for a product-of-experts code in real neurons.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of St Andrews", "University of St Andrews"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Dominik Endres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Endres:Dominik", "Peter F\u00f6ldi\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/F=ouml=ldi=aacute=k:Peter"], "pages": 8}
