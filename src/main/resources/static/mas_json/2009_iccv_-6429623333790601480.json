It is important for many vision understanding applications, e.g. visual interactive gaming, immersive virtual reality, content-based image retrieval, etc. However, it remains a challenging task because of unknown image background, presence of clutter, partial occlusion and especially the high dimensional state space (usually 30+ dimensions). In this paper, we contribute to human pose estimation in two aspects. First, we design two efficient Markov Chain dynamics under the data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) framework to effectively explore the complex solution space. Second, we parse the tree structure state space into a lexicographic order according to the image observations and body topology, and the optimization process is conducted in this order. This realizes a much more efficient exploration than the sampling based search and exhaustive search, and thus achieves a tremendous speed-up. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating various kinds of human poses, even with cluttered background , poor illumination or partial self-occlusion.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Intel", "Birkbeck, University of London", "National Labora ...
