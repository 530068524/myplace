We present an asymptotically optimal algorithm for solving this problem in terms of both space and time complexity. This improves on previous approaches, which can only count the number of packets in constant time. We evaluate our work on real packet traces, demonstrating an up to X2.5 speedup compared to the best alternative.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Bell Labs", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ran Ben-Basat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Basat:Ran", "Gil Einziger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Einziger:Gil", "Roy Friedman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedman:Roy", "Yaron Kassner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kassner:Yaron"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
