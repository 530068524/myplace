In a mixed-reality (MR) environment, the appearance of touchable objects can be changed by superimposing a computer-generated image onto them (MR visual stimulation). In our previous study, we first superimposed computer-generated images (CGI) on real objects, and then, applied extreme deformation to the superimposed images while the participants pressed the real objects with their fingers. The results showed that humans sense hardness differently while receiving MR visual stimulation; we named this psychophysical effect the dent-softness illusion. As the next step, in this study, we verify whether humans perceive hardness differently when pressing a real object with and without superimposed animation and whether the dent-softness illusion occurs in different parts of the body such as the finger, palm, and arm.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University"], "authors": ["Yohei Sano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sano:Yohei", "Yuichi Hirano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirano:Yuichi", "Asako Kimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimura:Asako", "Fumihisa Shibata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shibata:Fumihisa", "Hideyuki Tamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamura:Hideyuki"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
