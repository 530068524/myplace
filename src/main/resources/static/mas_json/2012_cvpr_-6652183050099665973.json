They are classically computed in one pass over integral image by reading the values at the feature corners. Here we present a new, general parsing formalism for convolving them more efficiently. Our method is fully automatic and applicable to an arbitrary set of Haar-like features. The parser reduces the number of memory accesses which are the main computational bottleneck during convolution on modern computer architectures. It first splits the features into simpler kernels. Then it aligns and reuses them where applicable forming an ensemble of recursive convolution trees, which can be computed faster. This is illustrated with experiments, which show a significant speed-up over the classic approach.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Telecom SudParis", "Telecom SudParis", "Telecom SudParis", "University of Paris"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Daniel Wesierski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wesierski:Daniel", "Maher Mkhinini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mkhinini:Maher", "Patrick Horain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horain:Patrick", "Anna Jezierska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jezierska:Anna"], "pages": 8}
