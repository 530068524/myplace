To facilitate communication, Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is commonly used in intervention settingss. Different forms of AAC have been used; however, one key aspect of AAC is that children have different preferences and needs in the intervention process. One particular AAC method does not necessarily work for all children. Although robots have been used in different applications, this is one of the first times that robots have been used for improvement of communication in nonverbal children. In this work, we explore robot-based AAC through humanoid robots that assist therapists in interventions with nonverbal children. Through playing activities, our study assessed changes in gestures, vocalization, speech, and verbal expression in children. Our initial results show that robot-based AAC intervention has a positive impact on the communication skills of nonverbal children.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Ewha Womans University", "Ewha Womans University", "Ewha Womans University", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Kyung Hea Jeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeon:Kyung_Hea", "Seok Jeong Yeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeon:Seok_Jeong", "Young Tae Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Young_Tae", "Seokwoo Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Seokwoo", "John Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:John"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
