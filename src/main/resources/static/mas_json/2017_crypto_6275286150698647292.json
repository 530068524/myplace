{"title": "The TinyTable Protocol for 2-Party Secure Computation, or: Gate-Scrambling Revisited.", "fields": ["secure two party computation", "amortized analysis", "security parameter", "commitment scheme", "universal composability"], "abstract": "We propose a new protocol, nicknamed TinyTable, for maliciously secure 2-party computation in the preprocessing model. One version of the protocol is useful in practice and allows, for instance, secure AES encryption with latency about 1 ms and amortized time about 0.5 \\(\\upmu \\)s per AES block on a fast cloud set-up. Another version is interesting from a theoretical point of view: we achieve a maliciously and unconditionally secure 2-party protocol in the preprocessing model for computing a Boolean circuit, where both the communication complexity and preprocessed data size needed is O(s) where s is the circuit size, while the computational complexity is \\(O(k^\\epsilon s)\\) where k is the statistical security parameter and \\(\\epsilon <1\\) is a constant. For general circuits with no assumption on their structure, this is the best asymptotic performance achieved so far in this model.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "George Mason University"], "authors": ["Ivan Damg\u00e5rd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damg=aring=rd:Ivan", "Jesper Buus Nielsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nielsen:Jesper_Buus", "Michael Nielsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nielsen_0001:Michael", "Samuel Ranellucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranellucci:Samuel"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 21}
