We show how a learner robot can learn to produce and interpret spatial utterances in guided-learning interactions with a tutor robot (equipped with a system for producing English spatial phrases). The tutor guides the learning process by simplifying the challenges and complexity of utterances, gives feedback, and gradually increases the complexity of the language to be learnt. Our experiments show promising results towards long-term, incremental acquisition of natural language in a process of co-development of syntax and semantics.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Sony Computer S ... , Tokyo, Japan", "ICREA, Institut ... rcelona, Spain"], "authors": ["Michael Spranger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spranger:Michael", "Luc Steels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steels:Luc"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
