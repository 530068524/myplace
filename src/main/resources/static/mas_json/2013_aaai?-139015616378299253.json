{"title": "Liberal Safety for Answer Set Programs with External Sources.", "fields": ["logic programming", "non monotonic logic", "modular design", "extensibility", "answer set programming"], "abstract": "Answer set programs with external source access may introduce new constants that are not present in the program, which is known as value invention. As naive value invention leads to programs with infinite grounding and answer sets, syntactic safety criteria are imposed on programs. However, traditional criteria are in many cases unnecessarily strong and limit expressiveness. We present liberal domain-expansion (de-) safe programs, a novel generic class of answer set programs with external source access that has a finite grounding and allows for value invention. De-safe programs use so-called term bounding functions as a parameter for modular instantiation with concrete--e.g., syntactic or semantic or both--safety criteria. This ensures extensibility of the approach in the future. We provide concrete instances of the framework and develop an operator that can be used for computing a finite grounding. Finally, we discuss related notions of safety from the literature, and show that our approach is strictly more expressive.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Thomas Eiter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eiter:Thomas", "Michael Fink.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fink_0001:Michael", "Thomas Krennwallner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krennwallner:Thomas", "Christoph Redl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Redl:Christoph"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
