In contrast to existing aggregation schemes that focus on reducing the energy consumption and extending the operational lifetime of each individual node, LBA has a unique design goal to balance the nodal lifetime and thus prolong the network lifetime more effectively. To achieve this goal in a distributed manner, LBA adaptively adjusts the aggregation holding time between neighboring nodes to balance their nodal lifetime; as such balancing take place in all neighborhoods, nodes in the entire network can gradually adjust their nodal lifetime towards the globally balanced status. Experimental studies on a sensor network testbed shows that LBA can achieve the design goal, yield longer network lifetime than other non-adaptive and nodal lifetime-unaware data aggregation schemes, and approach the theoretical upperbound performance, especially when nodes have highly different nodal lifetime.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Zi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zi", "Yang Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Yang", "Daji Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao:Daji", "Wensheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Wensheng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
