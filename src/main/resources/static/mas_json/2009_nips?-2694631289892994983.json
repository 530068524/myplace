We show that with appropriate constraints, the generalization error of regularized distance metric learning could be independent from the dimensionality, making it suitable for handling high dimensional data. In addition, we present an efficient online learning algorithm for regularized distance metric learning. Our empirical studies with data classification and face recognition show that the proposed algorithm is (i) effective for distance metric learning when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and (ii) efficient and robust for high dimensional data.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "National Institutes of Health", "Michigan State University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Shijun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shijun", "Yang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yang"], "pages": 9}
