We present an enquiry into design for dementia facilitated by a public art commission for an adult mental health unit in a hospital in the UK. The interactive art piece was informed by the notion of personhood in dementia that foregrounds the person's social being and interpersonal relationships as sites where self is maintained and constructed. How clients, clients' family members and staff used the piece is reported and insights related to the notions of home, intimacy, possessions and self are presented. The art piece served as window on both dementia and the institution leading to a number of insights and implications for design.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Northumbria University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["Jayne Wallace.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wallace:Jayne", "Anja Thieme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thieme:Anja", "Gavin Wood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wood:Gavin", "Guy Schofield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schofield:Guy", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
