{"title": "Modulating early visual processing by language.", "fields": ["computational model", "visual processing", "resnet", "normalization", "residual"], "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that language refers to high-level visual concepts while leaving low-level visual processing unaffected. This view dominates the current literature in computational models for language-vision tasks, where visual and linguistic inputs are mostly processed independently before being fused into a single representation. In this paper, we deviate from this classic pipeline and propose to modulate the \\emph{entire visual processing} by a linguistic input. Specifically, we introduce Conditional Batch Normalization (CBN) as an efficient mechanism to modulate convolutional feature maps by a linguistic embedding. We apply CBN to a pre-trained Residual Network (ResNet), leading to the MODulatEd ResNet (\\MRN) architecture, and show that this significantly improves strong baselines on two visual question answering tasks. Our ablation study confirms that modulating from the early stages of the visual processing is beneficial.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "university of lille", "university of lille", "Google", "DeepMind"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Harm de Vries.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vries:Harm_de", "Florian Strub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strub:Florian", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Mary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mary:J=eacute=r=eacute=mie", "Hugo Larochelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larochelle:Hugo", "Olivier Pietquin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietquin:Olivier", "Aaron C.
