{"title": "Automated migration of build scripts using dynamic analysis and search-based refactoring.", "fields": ["software build", "programming language", "code refactoring", "abstraction layer", "scripting language"], "abstract": "The efficiency of a build system is an important factor for developer productivity. As a result, developer teams have been increasingly adopting new build systems that allow higher build parallelization. However, migrating the existing legacy build scripts to new build systems is a tedious and error-prone process. Unfortunately, there is insufficient support for automated migration of build scripts, making the migration more problematic.   We propose the first  dynamic  approach for automated migration of build scripts to new build systems. Our approach works in two phases. First, from a set of execution traces, we  synthesize  build scripts that accurately capture the intent of the original build. The synthesized build scripts are typically long and hard to maintain. Second, we apply  refactorings  that raise the abstraction level of the synthesized scripts (e.g., introduce functions for similar fragments). As different refactoring sequences may lead to different build scripts, we use a search-based approach that  explores  various sequences to identify the best (e.g., shortest) build script. We optimize search-based refactoring with  partial-order reduction  to faster explore refactoring sequences. We implemented the proposed two phase migration approach in a tool called METAMORPHOSIS that has been recently used at Microsoft.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Milos Gligoric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gligoric:Milos", "Wolfram Schulte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schulte:Wolfram", "Chandra Prasad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prasad:Chandra", "Danny van Velzen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Velzen:Danny_van", "Iman Narasamdya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narasamdya:Iman", "Benjamin Livshits.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Livshits:Benjamin"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2014", "pages": 18}
