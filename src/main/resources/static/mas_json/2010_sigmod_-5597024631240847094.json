It is common that the user is unsure of his/her preference, so care must be taken to elicit the preference of the user correctly. In this paper, we propose to elicit the preferred ordering of a user by utilizing skyline objects as the representatives of the possible ordering. We introduce the notion of  order-based representative skylines  which selects representatives based on the orderings that they represent. To further facilitate preference exploration, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to compute a denogram on the skyline objects. By coupling the hierarchical clustering with visualization techniques, we allow users to refine their preference weight settings by browsing the hierarchy. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results validate the feasibility and the efficiency of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "University of Texas at Arlington", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Feng Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Feng", "Gautam Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das_0001:Gautam", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee", "Anthony K.
