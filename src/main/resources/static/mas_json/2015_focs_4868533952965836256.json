This generic method was originally introduced by Flajolet and Martin [FOCS'83] in order to save a factor a#x03A9;(k) of time per element over k independent samples when estimating the number of distinct elements in a data stream. It was also used in the widely used Hyper Log Log algorithm of Flajolet et al. [AOFA'97] and in large-scale machine learning by Li et al. [NIPS'12] for minwise estimation of set similarity. The main issue of k-partition, is that the contents of different bins may be highly correlated when using popular hash functions. This means that methods of analyzing the marginal distribution for a single bin do not apply. Here we show that a tabulation based hash function, mixed tabulation, does yield strong concentration bounds on the most popular applications of k-partitioning similar to those we would get using a truly random hash function. The analysis is very involved and implies several new results of independent interest for both simple and double tabulation, e.g. A simple and efficient construction for invertible bloom filters and uniform hashing on a given set.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["S\u00f8ren Dahlgaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dahlgaard:S=oslash=ren", "Mathias B\u00e6k Tejs Knudsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knudsen:Mathias_B=aelig=k_Tejs", "Eva Rotenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rotenberg:Eva", "Mikkel Thorup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thorup:Mikkel"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 19}
