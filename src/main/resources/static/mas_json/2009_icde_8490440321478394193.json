{"title": "Large-Scale Deduplication with Constraints Using Dedupalog.", "fields": ["data deduplication", "information engineering", "query language", "subclass", "datalog"], "abstract": "We present a declarative framework for collective deduplication of entity references in the presence of constraints. Constraints occur naturally in many data cleaning domains and can improve the quality of deduplication. An example of a constraint is \"each paper has a unique publication venue''; if two paper references are duplicates, then their associated conference references must be duplicates as well. Our framework supports collective deduplication, meaning that we can dedupe both paper references and conference references collectively in the example above. Our framework is based on a simple declarative Datalog-style language with precise semantics. Most previous work on deduplication either ignoreconstraints or use them in an ad-hoc domain-specific manner. We also present efficient algorithms to support the framework. Our algorithms have precise theoretical guarantees for a large subclass of our framework. We show, using a prototype implementation, that our algorithms scale to very large datasets. We provide thoroughexperimental results over real-world data demonstrating the utility of our framework for high-quality and scalable deduplication.", "citation": "Citations (165)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Arvind Arasu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arasu:Arvind", "Christopher R\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=eacute=:Christopher", "Dan Suciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suciu:Dan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
