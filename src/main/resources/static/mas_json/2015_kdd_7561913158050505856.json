{"title": "Algorithmic Cartography: Placing Points of Interest and Ads on Maps.", "fields": ["incentive compatibility", "data set", "point of interest", "baseline", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We study the problem of selecting a set of points of interest (POIs) to show on a map. We begin with a formal model of the setting, noting that the utility of a POI may be discounted by (i) the presence of competing businesses nearby as well as (ii) its position in the set of establishments ordered by distance from the user. We present simple, approximately optimal selection algorithms, coupled with incentive compatible pricing schemes in case of advertiser supplied points of interest. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms on real data sets and show that they outperform simple baselines.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Google", "Stanford University", "Google"], "authors": ["Mohammad Mahdian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahdian:Mohammad", "Okke Schrijvers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schrijvers:Okke", "Sergei Vassilvitskii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vassilvitskii:Sergei"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
