We start providing a bound independent of the MRF structure and parameters. Afterwards, we show how this bound can be improved for MRFs with specific structures such as bipartite graphs or grids. Our results provide interesting insight into the behavior of max-product. For example, we prove that max-product provides very good results (at least 90% optimal) on MRFs with large variable-disjoint cycles1.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council", "University of Verona", "Spanish National Research Council"], "authors": ["Meritxell Vinyals.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vinyals:Meritxell", "Jes\u00fas Cerquides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cerquides:Jes=uacute=s", "Alessandro Farinelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farinelli:Alessandro", "Juan A.
