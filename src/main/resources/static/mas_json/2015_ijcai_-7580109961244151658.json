{"title": "Framing Image Description as a Ranking Task: Data, Models and Evaluation Metrics (Extended Abstract).", "fields": ["ranking", "machine learning", "data modeling", "framing", "sentence"], "abstract": "In [Hodosh et al., 2013], we establish a rankingbased framework for sentence-based image description and retrieval. We introduce a new dataset of images paired with multiple descriptive captions that was specifically designed for these tasks. We also present strong KCCA-based baseline systems for description and search, and perform an in-depth study of evaluation metrics for these two tasks. Our results indicate that automatic evaluation metrics for our ranking-based tasks are more accurate and robust than those proposed for generation-based image description.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Micah Hodosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hodosh:Micah", "Peter Young.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Young:Peter", "Julia Hockenmaier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hockenmaier:Julia"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 5}
