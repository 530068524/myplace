{"title": "On the throughput-delay trade-off in georouting networks.", "fields": ["network packet", "bounded function", "mobility model", "random walk", "communication complexity"], "abstract": "We study the scaling properties of a georouting scheme in a wireless multi-hop network of n mobile nodes. Our aim is to increase the network capacity quasi linearly with n while keeping the average delay bounded. In our model, mobile nodes move according to an i.i.d. random walk with velocity v and transmit packets to randomly chosen destinations. The average packet delivery delay of our scheme is of order 1/v and it achieves the network capacity of order equation. This shows a practical throughput-delay trade-off, in particular when compared with the seminal result of Gupta and Kumar which shows network capacity of order equation and negligible delay and the groundbreaking result of Grossglauser and Tse which achieves network capacity of order n but with an average delay of order \u221an/v. The foundation of our improved capacity and delay trade-off relies on the fact that we use a mobility model that contains free space motion, a model that we consider more realistic than classic brownian motions. We confirm the generality of our analytical results using simulations under various interference models.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Macquarie University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Philippe Jacquet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacquet:Philippe", "Salman Malik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malik:Salman", "Bernard Mans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mans:Bernard", "Alonso Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva:Alonso"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
