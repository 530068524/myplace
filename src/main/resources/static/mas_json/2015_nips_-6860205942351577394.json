{"title": "A Convergent Gradient Descent Algorithm for Rank Minimization and Semidefinite Programming from Random Linear Measurements.", "fields": ["global optimum", "condition number", "binary logarithm", "positive definite matrix", "semidefinite embedding"], "abstract": "We propose a simple, scalable, and fast gradient descent algorithm to optimize a nonconvex objective for the rank minimization problem and a closely related family of semidefinite programs. With O(r3K2n log n) random measurements of a positive semidefinite n x n matrix of rank r and condition number K, our method is guaranteed to converge linearly to the global optimum.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Qinqing Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Qinqing", "John D.
