Unlike many desktop applications, Context-Aware applications have usually been used to support users in dynamic situations by utilizing many resources available through physical environments. This research takes a user's perspective on Context-Aware activities, to focus on user's motivation and perception among dynamic surroundings, and aims to demonstrate the role and importance of user involvement for Context-Aware services.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Cultural Commun ...
