We show such a continuous max-flow model leads to an equivalent min-cut problem in a natural way, as the corresponding dual model. In this regard, we revisit basic conceptions used in discrete max-flow / min-cut models and give their new explanations from a variational perspective. We also propose corresponding continuous max-flow and min-cut models constrained by priori supervised information and apply them to interactive image segmentation/labeling problems. We prove that the proposed continuous max-flow and min-cut models, with or without supervised constraints, give rise to a series of global binary solutions \u03bb\u2217(x) \u220a {0,1}, which globally solves the original nonconvex image partitioning problems. In addition, we propose novel and reliable multiplier-based max-flow algorithms. Their convergence is guaranteed by classical optimization theories. Experiments on image segmentation, unsupervised and supervised, validate the effectiveness of the discussed continuous max-flow and min-cut models and suggested max-flow based algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (229)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Western Ontario", "University of Bergen", "University of Bergen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jing Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan_0001:Jing", "Egil Bae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bae:Egil", "Xue-Cheng Tai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tai:Xue=Cheng"], "pages": 8}
