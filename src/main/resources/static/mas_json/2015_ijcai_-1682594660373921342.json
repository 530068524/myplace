While finding successful manipulations or agenda controls is tractable for both procedures, our real-world experimental results indicate that most elections cannot be manipulated by a few voters and agenda control is typically impossible. If the voter preferences are incomplete, then finding possible winners is NP-hard for both procedures. Whereas finding necessary winners is coNP-hard for the amendment procedure, it is polynomial-time solvable for the successive one.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Robert Bredereck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bredereck:Robert", "Jiehua Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiehua", "Rolf Niedermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niedermeier:Rolf", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
