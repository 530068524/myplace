{"title": "No-Regret Algorithms for Heavy-Tailed Linear Bandits.", "fields": ["bounded function", "truncation", "estimator", "sublinear function", "regret"], "abstract": "We analyze the problem of linear bandits under heavy tailed noise. Most of the work on linear bandits has been based on the assumption of bounded or sub-Gaussian noise. This assumption however is often violated in common scenarios such as financial markets. We present two algorithms to tackle this problem: one based on dynamic truncation and one based on a median of means estimator. We show that, when the noise admits only a 1 + e moment, these algorithms are still able to achieve regret in O (T2+e/2(1+e)) and O (T1+2e/1+3e) respectively. In particular, they guarantee sublinear regret as long as the noise has finite variance. We also present empirical results showing that our algorithms achieve a better performance than the current state of the art for bounded noise when the L\u221e bound on the noise is large yet the 1+e moment of the noise is small.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Google", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Andres Mu\u00f1oz Medina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medina:Andres_Mu=ntilde=oz", "Scott Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Scott"], "pages": 9}
