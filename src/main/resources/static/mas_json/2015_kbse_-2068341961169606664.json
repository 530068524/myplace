This tool is implemented in Java and makes use of Android's APIs UI Automator and UiAutomation. The tool automatically explores a mobile application in order to automatically identify and test UI Patterns. Each UI Pattern has a test strategy, Test Patterns, associated, which is applied when an UI Pattern is found. The approach works on top of a catalogue of UI Patterns, which determines which UI Patterns are to be tested, and what should their correct behaviour be, and may be used for any application.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Porto", "University of Porto"], "authors": ["Ines Coimbra Morgado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morgado:Ines_Coimbra", "Ana C.
