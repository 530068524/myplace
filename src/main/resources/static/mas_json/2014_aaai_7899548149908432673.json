{"title": "Efficiently Implementing GOLOG with Answer Set Programming.", "fields": ["logic programming", "encoding", "action description language", "semantics", "answer set programming"], "abstract": "In this paper we investigate three different approaches to encoding domain-dependent control knowledge for Answer-Set Planning. Starting with a standard implementation of the action description language B, we add control knowledge expressed in the GOLOG logic programming language. A naive encoding, following the original definitions of Levesque et al., is shown to scale poorly. We examine two alternative codings based on the transition semantics of ConGOLOG. We show that a speed increase of multiple orders of magnitude can be obtain by compiling the GOLOG program into a finitestate machine representation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Malcolm Ryan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryan:Malcolm"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 6}
