As a consequence, using a set of base functions with global support such as spherical harmonics, the matrix of normal equations tends to be ill-conditioned, leading to weakly determined low-order spherical harmonic coefficients. The corresponding geopotential strongly oscillates at the poles.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Technical University of Madrid", "Carlos III Health Institute", "Technical University of Madrid", "Brigham Young University", "Brigham Young University", "Brigham Young University", "Nankai University", "Brigham Young University", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Renato Negrinho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Negrinho:Renato", "Andre Martins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martins:Andre"], "pages": 9}
