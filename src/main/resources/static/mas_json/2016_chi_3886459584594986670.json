{"title": "Why That Nao?: How Humans Adapt to a Conventional Humanoid Robot in Taking Turns-at-Talk.", "fields": ["turn taking", "robot learning", "conversation analysis", "social robot", "personal robot"], "abstract": "This paper explores how humans adapt to a conventional humanoid robot. Video data of participants playing a charade game with a Nao robot were analyzed from a multimodal conversation analysis perspective. Participants soon adjust aspects of turn-design such as word selection, turn length and prosody, thereby adapting to the robot's limited perceptive abilities as they become apparent in the interaction. However, coordination of turns-at-talk remains troublesome throughout the encounter, as evidenced by overlapping turns and lengthy silences around possible turn endings. The study discusses how the robot design can be improved to support the problematic taking of turns-at-talk with humans. Two programming strategies to address the identified problems are presented: 1. to program the robot so that it will be systematically receptive at the equivalence to transition relevance places in human-human interaction, and 2. to make the robot preferably produce verbal actions that require a response in a conditional way, rather than making a response only possible.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Osnabr\u00fcck", "Link\u00f6ping University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Hannah R.
