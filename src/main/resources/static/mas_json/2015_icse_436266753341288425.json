We propose a novel method of dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) to automatically find a path of a program satisfying a regular property. What makes our method distinct is when exploring the path space, DSE is guided by the synergy of static analysis and dynamic analysis to find a target path as soon as possible. We have implemented our guided DSE method for Java programs based on JPF and WALA, and applied it to 13 real-world open source Java programs, a total of 225K lines of code, for extensive experiments. The results show the effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility and scalability of the method. Compared with the pure DSE on the time to find the first target path, the average speedup of the guided DSE is more than 258X when analyzing the programs that have more than 100 paths.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "Birmingham City University"], "authors": ["Yufeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yufeng", "Zhenbang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhenbang", "Ji Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ji", "Wei Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0006:Wei", "Zhiming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Zhiming"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
