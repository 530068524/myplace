{"title": "Efficient Exact Similarity Searches Using Multiple Token Orderings.", "fields": ["merge", "exploit", "security token", "prefix", "nearest neighbor search"], "abstract": "Similarity searches are essential in many applications including data cleaning and near duplicate detection. Many similarity search algorithms first generate candidate records, and then identify true matches among them. A major focus of those algorithms has been on how to reduce the number of candidate records in the early stage of similarity query processing. One of the most commonly used techniques to reduce the candidate size is the prefix filtering principle, which exploits the document frequency ordering of tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel partitioning technique that considers multiple token orderings based on token co-occurrence statistics. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is effective in reducing the number of candidate records and as a result improves the performance of existing algorithms significantly.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Chonbuk National University", "Google"], "authors": ["Jongik Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jongik", "Hongrae Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hongrae"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
