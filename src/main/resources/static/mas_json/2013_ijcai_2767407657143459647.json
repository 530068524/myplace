A preference-based approach to CBR appears to be appealing for several reasons, notably because case-based experiences naturally lend themselves to representations in terms of preference or order relations. Moreover, the flexibility and expressiveness of a preference-based formalism well accommodate the uncertain and approximate nature of case-based problem solving. In this paper, we outline the basic ideas of preference-based CBR and sketch a formal framework for realizing these ideas.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Marburg", "University of Marburg"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Eyke H\u00fcllermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=uuml=llermeier:Eyke", "Weiwei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Weiwei"], "pages": 5}
