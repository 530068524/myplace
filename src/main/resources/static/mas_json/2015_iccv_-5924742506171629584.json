The ability to operate on unstructured photo collections enables modeling a huge number of people, including celebrities and other well photographed people without requiring them to be scanned. Moreover, we show the ability to drive or puppeteer the captured person B using any other video of a different person A. In this scenario, B acts out the role of person A, but retains his/her own personality and character. Our system is based on a novel combination of 3D face reconstruction, tracking, alignment, and multi-texture modeling, applied to the puppeteering problem. We demonstrate convincing results on a large variety of celebrities derived from Internet imagery and video.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Supasorn Suwajanakorn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suwajanakorn:Supasorn", "Steven M.
