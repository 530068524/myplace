In contrast to most known approaches for linearly structured rank minimization, we do not (a) use the full SVD; nor (b) resort to augmented Lagrangian techniques; nor (c) solve linear systems per iteration. Instead, we formulate the problem differently so that it is amenable to a generalized conditional gradient method, which results in a practical improvement with low per iteration computational cost. Numerical results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in terms of running time, while effectively recovering low rank solutions in stochastic system realization and spectral compressed sensing problems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Adams Wei Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Adams_Wei", "Wanli Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Wanli", "Yaoliang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yaoliang", "Jaime G.
