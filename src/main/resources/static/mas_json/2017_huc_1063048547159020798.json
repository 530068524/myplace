This paper demonstrates a framework to augment learning activities by packaging two key ideas: Eyetifact and HyperMind. Eyetifact is a system that converts data of eye movements beyond the difference of sensing devices to collect a large amount of training data for machine learning. HyperMind is a digital textbook that displays learning materials dynamically based on a learner's cognitive states as measured by several sensors. In order to implement these two ideas, we have conducted experiments related to eyewear computing, textbook reading behavior analysis, and stress sensing. The contributions of this research are to investigate approaches that recognize human abilities and to transfer them from experts to others.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence"], "authors": ["Shoya Ishimaru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishimaru:Shoya", "Andreas Dengel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dengel:Andreas"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
