In this paper, we propose a Code Embedded Distributed Adaptive and Reliable (CEDAR) link-layer framework that targets low latency and high throughput. CEDAR is the first comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing and designing distributed and adaptive error recovery for wireless networks. It employs a theoretically-sound framework for embedding channel codes in each packet and performs the error correcting process in selected intermediate nodes in packet's route. To identify the intermediate nodes for the en/decoding for minimizing average packet latency, we mathematically analyze the average packet delay, using Finite State Markovian Channel model and priority queuing model, and then formalize the problem as a non-linear integer programming problem. Also, we propose a scalable and distributed scheme to solve this problem. The results from real-world testbed \u201cNESTbed\u201d and simulation with Matlab prove that CEDAR is superior to the schemes using hop-by-hop decoding and destination-decoding not only in packet delay but also in throughput. In addition, the simulation results show that CEDAR can achieve the optimal performance in most cases.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Clemson University", "Clemson University", "Clemson University", "Clemson University", "Intell.
