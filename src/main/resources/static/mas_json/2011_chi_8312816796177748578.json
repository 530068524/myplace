{"title": "Interaction design for cancer patients: do we need to take into account the effects of illness and medication?", "fields": ["interaction design", "user interface", "usability", "health care", "health informatics"], "abstract": "In this paper we explore how having cancer and receiving therapy influences upon patients' ability to use an online healthcare system. The motivation is that no empirically based design guidelines are available concerning this user group. Ignoring possible effects of illness and therapy can result in systems with poor usability and user acceptance. A case-control usability test with 14 cancer patients and 14 matched controls revealed that the cancer patients experienced significantly more difficulties compared with the healthy controls using a web-based online healthcare system. We conclude that designers of online healthcare systems need to take into consideration the unique challenges of being ill and/or using medication.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Anita Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das_0002:Anita", "Arild Faxvaag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faxvaag:Arild", "Dag Svan\u00e6s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svan=aelig=s:Dag"], "pages": 4}
