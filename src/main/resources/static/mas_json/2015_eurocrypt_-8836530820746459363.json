The construction increases the security of an \\(n\\)-bit core block cipher with a \\(\\kappa \\)-bit key by using two additional \\(n\\)-bit masking keys. Recently, several concrete instances of the FX-construction were proposed, including PRINCE (proposed at Asiacrypt 2012) and PRIDE (proposed at CRYPTO 2014). These ciphers have \\(n=\\kappa =64\\), and are proven to guarantee about \\(127-d\\) bits of security, assuming that their core ciphers are ideal, and the adversary can obtain at most \\(2^d\\) data.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Itai Dinur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinur:Itai"], "pages": 23}
