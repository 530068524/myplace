We present FingerGlass, a bimanual technique designed to improve the precision of graphical tasks on multitouch screens. It enables users to quickly navigate to different locations and across multiple scales of a scene using a single hand. The other hand can simultaneously interact with objects in the scene. Unlike traditional pan-zoom interfaces, FingerGlass retains contextual information during the interaction. We evaluated our technique in the context of precise object selection and translation and found that FingerGlass significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art baseline techniques in both objective and subjective measurements: users acquired and translated targets more than 50% faster than with the second-best technique in our experiment.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dominik P.
