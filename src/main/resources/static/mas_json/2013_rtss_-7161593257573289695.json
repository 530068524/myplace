This scheduling policy is a generalization of global fully pre-emptive and non-pre-emptive fixed task priority policies for platforms with at least two homogeneous processors. The scheduling protocol devised is such that a job can only be blocked at most once by a body of lower priority non-pre-emptive workload. The presented policy dominates both fully pre-emptive and fully non-pre-emptive with respect to schedulability. A sufficient schedulability test is presented for this policy. Several approaches to estimate the blocking generated by lower priority non-pre-emptive regions are presented. As a last contribution it is experimentally shown that, on the average case, the number of pre-emptions observed in a schedule are drastically reduced in comparison to global fully pre-emptive scheduling.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of York", "CISTER, Polytec ...
