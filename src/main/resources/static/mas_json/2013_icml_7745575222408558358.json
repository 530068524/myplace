Training S3VM involves either a combinatorial or non-convex optimization problem and thus finding the global optimal solution is intractable in practice. It has been demonstrated that a key to successfully find a good (local) solution of S3VM is to gradually increase the effect of unlabeled data, a la annealing. However, existing algorithms suffer from the trade-off between the resolution of annealing steps and the computation cost. In this paper, we go beyond this trade-off by proposing a novel training algorithm that efficiently performs annealing with an infinitesimal resolution. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed infinitesimal annealing algorithm tends to produce better solutions with less computation time than existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kohei Ogawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogawa:Kohei", "Motoki Imamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Imamura:Motoki", "Ichiro Takeuchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takeuchi:Ichiro", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
