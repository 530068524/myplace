Traditionally, however, they have only been applicable when the current state is exactly the same as a previously explored state. We consider a generalized transposition table, whereby a similarity metric that exploits local structure is used to compare the current state with a neighbourhood of previously seen states. We illustrate this concept and forward pruning based on function approximation in the domain of Skat, and show that we can achieve speedups of 16+ over standard methods.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Timothy Furtak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furtak:Timothy", "Michael Buro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buro:Michael"], "pages": 6}
