To avoid such perturbations, we present a novel technique to make any profiler implemented at the bytecode level aware of optimizations performed by the dynamic compiler. We implement our approach in a state-of-the-art Java virtual machine and demonstrate its significance with concrete profilers. We quantify the impact of escape analysis on allocation profiling, object life-time analysis, and the impact of method inlining on callsite profiling. We illustrate how our approach enables new kinds of profilers, such as a profiler for non-inlined callsites, and a testing framework for locating performance bugs in dynamic compiler implementations.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Yudi Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yudi", "Lubom\u00edr Bulej.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulej:Lubom=iacute=r", "Walter Binder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binder:Walter"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2015", "pages": 18}
