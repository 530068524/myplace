{"title": "MSO queries on trees: enumerating answers under updates.", "fields": ["xpath", "scratch", "binary logarithm", "preprocessor", "enumeration"], "abstract": "We investigate efficient view maintenance for MSO-definable queries over trees or, more precisely, efficient enumeration of answers to MSO-definable queries over words and trees which are subject to local updates. For words we exhibit an algorithm that uses an  O ( n ) preprocessing phase and enumerates answers with  O (log  n ) delay between them. When the word is updated, the algorithm can avoid repeating expensive preprocessing and restart the enumeration phase within  O (log  n ) time. For trees, our algorithm uses  O ( n ) preprocessing time, enumerates answers with  O (log 2   n ) delay, and can restart enumeration within  O (log 2   n ) time after receiving an update to the tree. This significantly improves the cost of recomputing the answers of a query from scratch. Our algorithms and complexity results in the paper are presented in terms of node-selecting automata representing the MSO queries.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Bayreuth", "University of Bayreuth"], "authors": ["Katja Losemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Losemann:Katja", "Wim Martens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martens:Wim"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
