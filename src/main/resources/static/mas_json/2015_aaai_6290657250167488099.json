{"title": "Crowdsourcing Complex Workflows under Budget Constraints.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "budget constraint", "machine learning", "workflow technology", "workflow"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of task allocation in crowdsourcing systems with multiple complex workflows, each of which consists of a set of inter-dependent micro-tasks. We propose Budgeteer, an algorithm to solve this problem under a budget constraint. In particular, our algorithm first calculates an efficient way to allocate budget to each workflow. It then determines the number of inter-dependent micro-tasks and the price to pay for each task within each workflow, given the corresponding budget constraints. We empirically evaluate it on a well-known crowdsourcing-based text correction workflow using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and show that Budgeteer can achieve similar levels of accuracy to current benchmarks, but is on average 45% cheaper.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "Jerusalem College of Technology", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Long Tran-Thanh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran=Thanh:Long", "Trung Dong Huynh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huynh:Trung_Dong", "Avi Rosenfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenfeld:Avi", "Sarvapali D.
