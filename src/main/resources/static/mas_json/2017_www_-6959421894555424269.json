In this work, we study the connection between metric learning and collaborative filtering. We propose Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) which learns a joint metric space to encode not only users' preferences but also the user-user and item-item similarity. The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms on a wide range of recommendation tasks and uncovers the underlying spectrum of users' fine-grained preferences. CML also achieves significant speedup for Top-K recommendation tasks using off-the-shelf, approximate nearest-neighbor search, with negligible accuracy reduction.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Cheng-Kang Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Cheng=Kang", "Longqi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Longqi", "Yin Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Yin", "Tsung-Yi Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Tsung=Yi", "Serge J.
