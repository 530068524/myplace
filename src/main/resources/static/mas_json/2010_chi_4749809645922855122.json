Mobile devices have limitations compared to PCs due to their inferior computing power and small screens, but a successful design of animated transitions can hide processing delays and make the user experience smoother. In this paper, we describe the design of animated transitions and present a user study on how they are perceived. The results show that in the transition between two images, bringing up the next image earlier dominates the perception of a fast transition over other variables examined in the study.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Nokia", "Nokia", "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland", "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Jussi Huhtala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huhtala:Jussi", "Ari-Heikki Sarjanoja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarjanoja:Ari=Heikki", "Jani M\u00e4ntyj\u00e4rvi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=auml=ntyj=auml=rvi:Jani", "Minna Isomursu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isomursu:Minna", "Jonna H\u00e4kkil\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=kkil=auml=:Jonna"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
