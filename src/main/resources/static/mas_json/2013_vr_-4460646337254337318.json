Three main aspects are addressed: 1) the ability to allow therapists to create new exercises and therapy programs intuitively by direct demonstration, 2) automatic therapy delivery and monitoring with the use of an autonomous virtual tutor that can monitor and quantitatively assess the motions performed by the patient, and 3) networked collaborative remote therapy sessions via connected applications displaying the motions of both the therapist and the patient. We also provide 3D assessment tools for monitoring changes in the range of motion, and for allowing the visualization of a number of properties during or after the execution of exercises. The presented system has been implemented for a low-cost hardware solution based on Kinect and for a high-end immersive virtual reality facility.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "University of California, Merced", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Carlo Camporesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camporesi:Carlo", "Marcelo Kallmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kallmann:Marcelo", "Jay J.
