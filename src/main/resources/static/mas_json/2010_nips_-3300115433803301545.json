Our algorithm solves an integer linear program in an online fashion. It exploits total unimodularity of the constraint matrix and a Lagrangian relaxation to solve the problem as a convex online game. The algorithm generates approximate solutions of max-flow problems by performing stochastic gradient descent on a set of flows. We apply the algorithm to optimize tier arrangement of over 84 million web pages on a layered set of caches to serve an incoming query stream optimally.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["eBay", "NICTA", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "eBay", "NICTA", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Gilbert Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Gilbert", "Novi Quadrianto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quadrianto:Novi", "Alexander J.
