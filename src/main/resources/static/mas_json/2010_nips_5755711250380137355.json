In this paper, we show that, despite the fact that the optimization problem is non-convex, the global optimal solution of variational Bayesian (VB) MF can be computed analytically by solving a quartic equation. This is highly advantageous over a popular VBMF algorithm based on iterated conditional modes since it can only find a local optimal solution after iterations. We further show that the global optimal solution of empirical VBMF (hyperparameters are also learned from data) can also be analytically computed. We illustrate the usefulness of our results through experiments.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Nikon", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Shinichi Nakajima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakajima:Shinichi", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi", "Ryota Tomioka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomioka:Ryota"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
