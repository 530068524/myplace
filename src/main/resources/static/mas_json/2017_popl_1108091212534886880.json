{"title": "Java generics are turing complete.", "fields": ["recursive language", "generics in java", "java modeling language", "turing reduction", "scala"], "abstract": "This paper describes a reduction from the halting problem of Turing machines to subtype checking in Java. It follows that subtype checking in Java is undecidable, which answers a question posed by Kennedy and Pierce in 2007. It also follows that Java's type checker can recognize any recursive language, which improves a result of Gill and Levy from 2016. The latter point is illustrated by a parser generator for fluent interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Kent"], "authors": ["Radu Grigore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grigore:Radu"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
