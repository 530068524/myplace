High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is the process of generating Register Transfer Level (RTL) design from these initial high-level programs. Unfortunately, this translation process itself can be buggy, which can create a mismatch between what a designer intends and what is actually implemented in the circuit. In this paper, we present an approach to validate the result of HLS against the initial high-level program using insights from translation validation, automated theorem proving and relational approaches to reasoning about programs. We have implemented our validating technique and have applied it to a highly parallelizing HLS framework called  SPARK . We present the details of our algorithm and experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (38)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Sudipta Kundu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kundu:Sudipta", "Sorin Lerner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerner:Sorin", "Rajesh Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta_0001:Rajesh"], "pages": 14}
