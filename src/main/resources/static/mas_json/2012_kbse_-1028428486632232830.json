{"title": "Semantic patch inference.", "fields": ["inference", "breadth first search", "linux kernel", "software evolution", "formal specification"], "abstract": "We propose a tool for inferring transformation specifications from a few examples of original and updated code. These transformation specifications may contain multiple code fragments from within a single function, all of which must be present for the transformation to apply. This makes the inferred transformations context sensitive. Our algorithm is based on depth-first search, with pruning. Because it is applied locally to a collection of functions that contain related changes, it is efficient in practice. We illustrate the approach on an example drawn from recent changes to the Linux kernel.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "National University of Singapore", "Singapore Management University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Jesper Andersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andersen:Jesper", "Anh Cuong Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Anh_Cuong", "David Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo_0001:David", "Julia L.
