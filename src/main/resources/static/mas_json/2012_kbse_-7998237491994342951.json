{"title": "Quokka: visualising interactions of enterprise software environment emulators.", "fields": ["distributed computing environment", "enterprise software", "data visualization", "service virtualization", "software system"], "abstract": "Enterprise software systems operate in large-scale, heterogeneous, distributed environments which makes assessment of non-functional properties, such as scalability and robustness, of those systems particularly challenging. Enterprise environment emulators can provide test-beds representative of real environments using only a few physical hosts thereby allowing assessment of the non-functional properties of enterprise software systems. To date, analysing outcomes of these tests has been an ad hoc and somewhat tedious affair; largely based on manual and/or script-assisted inspection of interaction logs. Quokka visualises emulations significantly aiding analysis and comprehension. Emulated interactions can be viewed live (in real-time) as well as be replayed at a later stage, furthermore, basic charts are used to aggregate and summarise emulations, helping to identify performance and scalability issues.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "CA Labs, Australia"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Cameron M.
