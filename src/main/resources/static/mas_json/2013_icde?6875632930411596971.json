{"title": "SAP HANA distributed in-memory database system: Transaction, session, and metadata management.", "fields": ["database tuning", "metadata repository", "database theory", "sargable", "view"], "abstract": "One of the core principles of the SAP HANA database system is the comprehensive support of distributed query facility. Supporting scale-out scenarios was one of the major design principles of the system from the very beginning. Within this paper, we first give an overview of the overall functionality with respect to data allocation, metadata caching and query routing. We then dive into some level of detail for specific topics and explain features and methods not common in traditional disk-based database systems. In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of distributed query processing in SAP HANA database to achieve scalability to handle large databases and heterogeneous types of workloads.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["SAP Labs., Seoul, South Korea", "SAP Labs., Seoul, South Korea", "SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany", "SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany", "SAP Labs., Seoul, South Korea"], "authors": ["Juchang Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Juchang", "Yong Sik Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Yong_Sik", "Franz F\u00e4rber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/F=auml=rber:Franz", "Michael Muehle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muehle:Michael", "Chulwon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chulwon", "Christian Bensberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bensberg:Christian", "Joo-Yeon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joo=Yeon", "Arthur H.
