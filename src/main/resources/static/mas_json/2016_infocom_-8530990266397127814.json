DiVA uses range-free pairwise comparisons of sound detection timestamps between local Voronoi neighbors to identify the node closest to the acoustic source, which then estimates the source's location using a constrained range-based method. Through simulation and experimental evaluations, DiVA is shown to be accurate and highly robust, making it practical for real-world applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Xueshu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Xueshu", "Shuailing Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shuailing", "Naigao Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Naigao", "Lei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0005:Lei", "Mathew L.
