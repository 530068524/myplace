Using a unified analytic framework, we show that, in any of these settings, for any e > 0, with enough rounds, the subject scheme can tolerate CCA attacks of up to q \u223c N1-e adversarial queries, where N is the size of the round functions' domain (the larger domain for alternating Feistel). Prior analyses for most generalized Feistel networks established security to only q \u223c N0.5 queries.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Viet Tung Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Viet_Tung", "Phillip Rogaway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogaway:Phillip"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2010", "pages": 18}
