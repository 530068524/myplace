{"title": "Jointly optimizing word representations for lexical and sentential tasks with the C-PHRASE model.", "fields": ["semantic data model", "phrase", "syntax", "natural language processing", "sentence"], "abstract": "We introduce C-PHRASE, a distributional semantic model that learns word representations by optimizing context prediction for phrases at all levels in a syntactic tree, from single words to full sentences. C-PHRASE outperforms the state-of-theart C-BOW model on a variety of lexical tasks. Moreover, since C-PHRASE word vectors are induced through a compositional learning objective (modeling the contexts of words combined into phrases), when they are summed, they produce sentence representations that rival those generated by ad-hoc compositional models.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nghia The Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Nghia_The", "Germ\u00e1n Kruszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kruszewski:Germ=aacute=n", "Angeliki Lazaridou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazaridou:Angeliki", "Marco Baroni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baroni:Marco"], "pages": 11}
