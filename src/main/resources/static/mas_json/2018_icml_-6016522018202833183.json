{"title": "Yes, but Did It Work?: Evaluating Variational Inference.", "fields": ["joint probability distribution", "importance sampling", "point estimation", "inference", "posterior probability"], "abstract": "While it's always possible to compute a variational approximation to a posterior distribution, it can be difficult to discover problems with this approximation\". We propose two diagnostic algorithms to alleviate this problem. The Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS) diagnostic gives a goodness of fit measurement for joint distributions, while simultaneously improving the error in the estimate. The variational simulation-based calibration (VSBC) assesses the average performance of point estimates.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Aalto University", "University of Toronto", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Yuling Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Yuling", "Aki Vehtari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vehtari:Aki", "Daniel Simpson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simpson:Daniel", "Andrew Gelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelman:Andrew"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
