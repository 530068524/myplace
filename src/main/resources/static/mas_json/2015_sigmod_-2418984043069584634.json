Billions of users generate, consume, and spread tons of information every day. This unprecedented scale of dynamics becomes invaluable to reflect our zeitgeist. However, most present diffusion extraction works have only touched individual user level and cannot obtain comprehensive clues.   This paper introduces a new approach, i.e., COmmunity Level Diffusion (COLD), to uncover and explore temporal diffusion. We model topics and communities in a unified latent framework, and extract inter-community influence dynamics. With a well-designed multi-component model structure and a parallel inference implementation on GraphLab, the COLD method is expressive while remaining efficient.   The extracted community level patterns enable diffusion exploration from a new perspective. We leverage the compact yet robust representations to develop new prediction and analysis applications. Extensive experiments on large social datasets show significant improvement in prediction accuracy. We can also find communities play very different roles in diffusion processes depending on their interest. Our method guarantees high scalability with increasing data size.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "East China Normal University", "Peking University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Zhiting Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Zhiting", "Junjie Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Junjie", "Bin Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui_0001:Bin", "Eric P.
