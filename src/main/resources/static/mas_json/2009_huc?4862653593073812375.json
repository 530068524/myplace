However, the settings in which they are deployed are already suffused with complex social dynamics. We report on a study of parole officers and parolees whose relationships are being transformed by location-based technologies. While parolees are clearly subjects of state discipline, the parole officers also find themselves subject to new responsibilities. This study highlights the complexities of power in sociotechnical systems and what happens when location becomes a tradable, technological object.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Irina Shklovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shklovski:Irina", "Janet Vertesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vertesi:Janet", "Emily Troshynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Troshynski:Emily", "Paul Dourish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dourish:Paul"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
