The apparatus is comprised of a camera and a projector whose center-of-perspective is located in the camera pupil plane 1 . The scene is illuminated with warped sinusoidal patterns as opposed to periodic or coded patterns. The findings reported in this work can help design imaging systems that feature improved optical resolution and 3D acquisition capabilities.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Southern Methodist University", "Southern Methodist University", "Southern Methodist University", "Southern Methodist University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Prasanna Rangarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangarajan:Prasanna", "Indranil Sinharoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinharoy:Indranil", "Panos Papamichalis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papamichalis:Panos", "Marc P.
