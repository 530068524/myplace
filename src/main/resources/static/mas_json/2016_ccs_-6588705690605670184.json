{"title": "Chainsaw: Chained Automated Workflow-based Exploit Generation.", "fields": ["internet security", "web application", "exploit", "workflow", "database schema"], "abstract": "We tackle the problem of automated exploit generation for web applications. In this regard, we present an approach that significantly improves the state-of-art in web injection vulnerability identification and exploit generation. Our approach for exploit generation tackles various challenges associated with typical web application characteristics: their multi-module nature, interposed user input, and multi-tier architectures using a database backend. Our approach develops precise models of application workflows, database schemas, and native functions to achieve high quality exploit generation. We implemented our approach in a tool called Chainsaw. Chainsaw was used to analyze 9 open source applications and generated over 199 first- and second-order injection exploits combined, significantly outperforming several related approaches.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Abeer Alhuzali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alhuzali:Abeer", "Birhanu Eshete.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eshete:Birhanu", "Rigel Gjomemo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gjomemo:Rigel", "V.
