{"title": "HemaApp IR: noninvasive hemoglobin measurement using unmodified smartphone cameras and built-in LEDs.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "autofocus", "light emitting diode", "embedded system", "infrared"], "abstract": "We propose a standalone demo prototype of HemaApp, a smartphone application that noninvasively monitors the hemoglobin concentration in the blood. A previous version HemaApp using a supplemental light attachment combined with an unmodified camera has been presented at Ubicomp 2016, however the current version is an improvement from the 2016 system demonstrating no external attachments. In this paper, we present the newest version of HemaApp, which combines the unmodified smartphone's camera, white LED flash, and IR sensor on the phone's laser autofocus system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Edward Jay Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Edward_Jay", "Junyi Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Junyi", "William Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:William", "Rajneil Rana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rana:Rajneil", "Shwetak Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Shwetak"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
