{"title": "Multi-task compressive sensing with Dirichlet process priors.", "fields": ["prior probability", "inference", "formalism", "dirichlet process", "compressed sensing"], "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) is an emerging \u00a3eld that, under appropriate conditions, can signi\u00a3cantly reduce the number of measurements required for a given signal. In many applications, one is interested in multiple signals that may be measured in multiple CS-type measurements, where here each signal corresponds to a sensing \"task\". In this paper we propose a novel multitask compressive sensing framework based on a Bayesian formalism, where a Dirichlet process (DP) prior is employed, yielding a principled means of simultaneously inferring the appropriate sharing mechanisms as well as CS inversion for each task. A variational Bayesian (VB) inference algorithm is employed to estimate the full posterior on the model parameters.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yuting Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Yuting", "Dehong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Dehong", "David B.
