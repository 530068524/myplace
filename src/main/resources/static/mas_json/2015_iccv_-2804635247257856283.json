{"title": "Shape Interaction Matrix Revisited and Robustified: Efficient Subspace Clustering with Corrupted and Incomplete Data.", "fields": ["brown clustering", "data stream clustering", "flame clustering", "subclu", "canopy clustering algorithm"], "abstract": "The Shape Interaction Matrix (SIM) is one of the earliest approaches to performing subspace clustering (i.e., separating points drawn from a union of subspaces). In this paper, we revisit the SIM and reveal its connections to several recent subspace clustering methods. Our analysis lets us derive a simple, yet effective algorithm to robustify the SIM and make it applicable to realistic scenarios where the data is corrupted by noise. We justify our method by intuitive examples and the matrix perturbation theory. We then show how this approach can be extended to handle missing data, thus yielding an efficient and general subspace clustering algorithm. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on several challenging motion segmentation and face clustering problems, where the data includes corruptions and missing measurements.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Australian National University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Australian National University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Pan Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Pan", "Mathieu Salzmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salzmann:Mathieu", "Hongdong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongdong"], "pages": 9}
