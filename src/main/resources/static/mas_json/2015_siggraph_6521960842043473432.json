This poster addresses two closely related geometric rationalizations of freeform surfaces with repetitive elements: freeform honeycomb structures defined as torsion-free structures where the walls of cells meet at 120 degrees, and Lobel frames formed by equilateral triangles. There turns out to be an interesting duality between these two structures, and this poster discusses the geometric relation, computation, modeling as well as applications of them.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Caigui Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Caigui", "Chengcheng Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Chengcheng", "Jun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jun", "Johannes Wallner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wallner:Johannes", "Helmut Pottmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pottmann:Helmut"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
