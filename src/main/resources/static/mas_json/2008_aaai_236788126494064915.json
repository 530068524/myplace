Our approach uses modal (conditional) logic to establish a uniform framework in which to study nonmonotonic consequence. We consider a particular mode of inference which employs a majority-based account of default reasoning--one which differs from the more familiar preferential accounts--and show how modal logic supplies a framework which facilitates analysis of, and comparison with more traditional formulations of nonmonotonic consequence.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Victor Jauregui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jauregui:Victor"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
