Repetitive or specialized tasks often require creation of small, often one-off, programs. End-users struggle with learning and using the myriad of domain-specific languages (DSLs) to effectively accomplish these tasks.   We present a general framework for constructing program synthesizers that take natural language (NL) inputs and produce expressions in a target DSL. The framework takes as input a DSL definition and training data consisting of NL/DSL pairs. From these it constructs a synthesizer by learning optimal weights and classifiers (using NLP features) that rank the outputs of a keyword-programming based translation. We applied our framework to three domains: repetitive text editing, an intelligent tutoring system, and flight information queries. On 1200+ English descriptions, the respective synthesizers rank the desired program as the top-1 and top-3 for 80% and 90% descriptions respectively.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Microsoft", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur"], "authors": ["Aditya Desai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desai:Aditya", "Sumit Gulwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gulwani:Sumit", "Vineet Hingorani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hingorani:Vineet", "Nidhi Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Nidhi", "Amey Karkare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karkare:Amey", "Mark Marron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marron:Mark", "Sailesh R.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R:Sailesh", "Subhajit Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Subhajit"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
