{"title": "An Assertion Retrieval Algebra for Object Queries over Knowledge Bases.", "fields": ["cache", "query rewriting", "identifier", "general knowledge", "assertion"], "abstract": "We consider a generalization of instance retrieval over knowledge bases that provides users with assertions in which descriptions of qualifying objects are given in addition to their identifiers. Notably, this involves a transfer of basic database paradigms involving caching and query rewriting in the context of an assertion retrieval algebra. We present an optimization framework for this algebra, with a focus on finding plans that avoid any need for general knowledge base reasoning at query execution time when sufficient cached results of earlier requests exist.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jeffrey Pound.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pound:Jeffrey", "David Toman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toman:David", "Grant E.
