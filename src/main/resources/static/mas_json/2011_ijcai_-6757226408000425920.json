It is found that the allocation problem in this model can be effectively transformed into a weighted bipartite matching in graph theory. By using the augmentation technique, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism in this model and demonstrate the advantages of the payment compared with the classical VCG payment (the Clarke pivot payment). We also show that the algorithms for both allocation and payment calculation run in polynomial time. It is expected that the method and results provided in this paper can be applied to the design and analysis of dynamic double auctions and futures markets.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Western Sydney", "University of Western Sydney", "University of Toulouse"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Dengji Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Dengji", "Dongmo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dongmo", "Laurent Perrussel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perrussel:Laurent"], "pages": 6}
