Unfortunately, context-aware Web services are still difficult to build. This paper describes ContextServ, a platform for rapid development of context-aware Web services. ContextServ adopts model-driven development where context-aware Web services are specified using ContextUML, a UML based modeling language. The platform also offers a set of automated tools for generating and deploying executable implementations of context-aware Web services. This paper presents the motivation, system design, implementation, and usage of ContextServ.", "citation": "Citations (42)", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "Texas State University"], "authors": ["Quan Z.
