{"title": "Using Gaussian Processes to Optimise Concession in Complex Negotiations against Unknown Opponents.", "fields": ["negotiation", "tournament", "adversary", "gaussian process", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In multi-issue automated negotiation against unknown opponents, a key part of effective negotiation is the choice of concession strategy. In this paper, we develop a principled concession strategy, based on Gaussian processes predicting the opponent's future behaviour. We then use this to set the agent's concession rate dynamically during a single negotiation session. We analyse the performance of our strategy and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art negotiating agents from the 2010 Automated Negotiating Agents Competition, in both a tournament setting and in self-play, across a variety of negotiation domains.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Colin R.
