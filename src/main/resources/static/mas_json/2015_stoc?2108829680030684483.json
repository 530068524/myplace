Here we are interested in a popular mathematical abstraction of this problem that has been widely studied in the statistics, signal processing and machine learning communities. We exactly resolve the threshold at which noisy super-resolution is possible. In particular, we establish a sharp phase transition for the relationship between the cutoff frequency (m) and the separation (\u0394). If m > 1/\u0394 + 1, our estimator converges to the true values at an inverse polynomial rate in terms of the magnitude of the noise. And when m", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ankur Moitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moitra:Ankur"], "pages": 10}
