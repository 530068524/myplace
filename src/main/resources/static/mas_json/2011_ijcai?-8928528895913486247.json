{"title": "Pattern Field Classification with Style Normalized Transformation.", "fields": ["transduction", "probabilistic logic", "bayes theorem", "normalization", "bayesian inference"], "abstract": "Field classification is an extension of the traditional classification framework, by breaking the i.i.d. assumption. In field classification, patterns occur as groups (fields) of homogeneous styles. By utilizing style consistency, classifying groups of patterns is often more accurate than classifying single patterns. In this paper, we extend the Bayes decision theory, and develop the Field Bayesian Model (FBM) to deal with field classification. Specifically, we propose to learn a Style Normalized Transformation (SNT) for each field. Via the SNTs, the data of different fields are transformed to a uniform style space (i.i.d. space). The proposed model is a general and systematic framework, under which many probabilistic models can be easily extended for field classification. To transfer the model to unseen styles, we propose a transductive model called Transfer Bayesian Rule (TBR) based on self-training. We conducted extensive experiments on face, speech and a large-scale handwriting dataset, and got significant error rate reduction compared to the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xu-Yao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xu=Yao", "Kaizhu Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Kaizhu", "Cheng-Lin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Cheng=Lin"], "pages": 6}
