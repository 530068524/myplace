The major step in our algorithm is simply minimizing two pseudo-Boolean functions. The processing time of our algorithm on images of moderate size is only half a second. Experiments on a benchmark dataset show that our method produces superpixels of comparable quality with existing algorithms. Last but not least, the speed of our algorithm is independent of the number of superpixels, which is usually the bottle-neck for the traditional algorithms of superpixel creation.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yuhang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Yuhang", "Richard I.
