We give a PRG with seed-length log n/e O(d)  fooling degree d PTFs with error at most e. Previously, no nontrivial constructions were known even for quadratic threshold functions and constant error e. For the class of degree 1 threshold functions or halfspaces, we construct PRGs with much better dependence on the error parameter e and obtain the following results. A PRG with seed length O(log n log(1/e)) for error e \u2265 1/poly(n). A PRG with seed length O(log n) for e \u2265 1/poly(log n). Previously, only PRGs with seed length O(log n log 2 (1/e)/ e 2 ) were known for halfspaces. We also obtain PRGs with similar seed lengths for fooling halfspaces over the $n$ dimensional unit sphere.   The main theme of our constructions and analysis is the use of invariance principles to construct pseudorandom generators. We also introduce the notion of monotone read-once branching programs, which is key to improving the dependence on the error rate e for halfspaces. These techniques may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Raghu Meka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meka:Raghu", "David Zuckerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuckerman:David"], "pages": 10}
