{"title": "Threats and Trade-Offs in Resource Critical Crowdsourcing Tasks Over Networks.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "management science", "mechanism design", "social network", "total cost"], "abstract": "In recent times, crowdsourcing over social networks has emerged as an active tool for complex task execution. In this paper, we address the problem faced by a planner to incentivize agents in the network to execute a task and also help in recruiting other agents for this purpose.We study this mechanism design problem under two natural resource optimization settings: (1) cost critical tasks, where the planner's goal is to minimize the total cost, and (2) time critical tasks, where the goal is to minimize the total time elapsed before the task is executed. We define a set of fairness properties that should be ideally satisfied by a crowdsourcing mechanism. We prove that no mechanism can satisfy all these properties simultaneously. We relax some of these properties and define their approximate counterparts. Under appropriate approximate fairness criteria, we obtain a non-trivial family of payment mechanisms. Moreover, we provide precise characterizations of cost critical and time critical mechanisms.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "General Motors", "IBM", "Indian Institute of Science", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Swaprava Nath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nath:Swaprava", "Pankaj Dayama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dayama:Pankaj", "Dinesh Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Dinesh", "Y.
