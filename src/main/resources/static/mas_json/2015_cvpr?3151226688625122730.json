In this paper, we propose a novel similarity measure for registration of two or more images. The proposed method is motivated by that the optimally registered images can be deeply sparsified in the gradient domain and frequency domain, with the separation of a sparse tensor of errors. One of the key advantages of the proposed similarity measure is its robustness to severe intensity distortions, which widely exist on medical images, remotely sensed images and natural photos due to the difference of acquisition modalities or illumination conditions. Two efficient algorithms are proposed to solve the batch image registration and pair registration problems in a unified framework. We validate our method on extensive challenging datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and efficiency of our method over 9 traditional and state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic images and a wide range of real-world applications.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Facebook", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yeqing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yeqing", "Chen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0003:Chen", "Fei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Fei", "Junzhou Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Junzhou"], "pages": 8}
