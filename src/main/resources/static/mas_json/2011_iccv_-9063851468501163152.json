The resulting dynamic fractal spectrum (DFS) for DT sequences consists of two components: One is the volumetric dynamic fractal spectrum component (V-DFS) that captures the stochastic self-similarities of DT sequences as 3D volume datasets; the other is the multi-slice dynamic fractal spectrum component (S-DFS) that encodes fractal structures of DT sequences on 2D slices along different views of the 3D volume. Various types of measures of DT sequences are collected in our approach to analyze DT sequences from different perspectives. The experimental evaluation is conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets. In all the experiments, our method demonstrated excellent performance in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["South China University of Technology", "South China University of Technology", "Temple University", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yong", "Yuhui Quan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quan:Yuhui", "Haibin Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Haibin", "Hui Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Hui"], "pages": 8}
