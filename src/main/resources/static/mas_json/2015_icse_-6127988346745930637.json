{"title": "An Information Retrieval Approach for Regression Test Prioritization Based on Program Changes.", "fields": ["software regression", "static program analysis", "profiling", "regression testing", "non regression testing"], "abstract": "Regression testing is widely used in practice for validating program changes. However, running large regression suites can be costly. Researchers have developed several techniques for  prioritizing  tests such that the higher-priority tests have a higher likelihood of finding bugs. A vast majority of these techniques are based on  dynamic  analysis, which can be precise but can also have significant overhead (e.g., for program instrumentation and test-coverage collection). We introduce a new approach, REPiR, to address the problem of regression test prioritization by reducing it to a standard Information Retrieval problem such that the differences between two program versions form the  query  and the tests constitute the  document collection.  REPiR does not require any dynamic profiling or static program analysis. As an enabling technology we leverage the open-source IR toolkit Indri. An empirical evaluation using eight open-source Java projects shows that REPiR is computationally efficient and performs better than existing (dynamic or static) techniques for the majority of subject systems.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Ripon K.
