{"title": "SunForum: Understanding Depression in a Chinese Online Community.", "fields": ["mental illness", "major depressive disorder", "social exclusion", "online community", "social media"], "abstract": "More than 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Major depressive disorder has a hugely negative impact on psychological well-being, work, and family life. Yet culture may shape how depressed patients interpret their symptoms, choose treatments, and behave. This paper reports a case study, including participant observations and interviews, of the Chinese online depression community, SunForum. Our findings reveal that Chinese cultural beliefs (e.g., the power of inner self-control) and Chinese beliefs about traditional medicine (e.g., the integrated body-mind relationship) significantly affect patients\u00e2   understandings of depression, illness management, and social interactions. These beliefs create problems of understanding depression in society \u00e2   including family members, friends, co-workers, and others \u00e2   and present various challenges for depressed patients who can become marginalized, suffer discrimination, and lose their jobs. We draw implications for how Chinese society as a whole may respond to the misunderstanding of mental illness and the raising of public awareness. We also propose specific social media design to support depressed patients as they seek online information and social support.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Rutgers University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Alibaba"], "authors": ["Guo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Guo", "Xiaomu Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaomu", "Tun Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Tun", "Jiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jiang", "Ning Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Ning"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
