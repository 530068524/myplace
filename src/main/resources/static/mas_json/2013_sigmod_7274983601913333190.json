{"title": "RTP: robust tenant placement for elastic in-memory database clusters.", "fields": ["operator", "response time", "server", "multitenancy", "in memory database"], "abstract": "In the cloud services industry, a key issue for cloud operators is to minimize operational costs. In this paper, we consider algorithms that elastically contract and expand a cluster of in-memory databases depending on tenants' behavior over time while maintaining response time guarantees.   We evaluate our tenant placement algorithms using traces obtained from one of SAP's production on-demand applications. Our experiments reveal that our approach lowers operating costs for the database cluster of this application by a factor of 2.2 to 10, measured in Amazon EC2 hourly rates, in comparison to the state of the art. In addition, we carefully study the trade-off between cost savings obtained by continuously migrating tenants and the robustness of servers towards load spikes and failures.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Brown University", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany", "SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jan Schaffner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaffner:Jan", "Tim Januschowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Januschowski:Tim", "Megan Kercher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kercher:Megan", "Tim Kraska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraska:Tim", "Hasso Plattner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plattner:Hasso", "Michael J.
