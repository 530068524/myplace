Most previous work focuses on learning and predicting with \"static\" temporal graphs only. However, in many applications such as mechanical systems and biology systems, the temporal dependencies might change over time. In this paper, we develop a dynamic temporal graphical models based on hidden Markov model regression and lasso-type algorithms. Our method is able to integrate two usually separate tasks, i.e. inferring underlying states and learning temporal graphs, in one unified model. The output temporal graphs provide better understanding about complex systems, i.e. how their dependency graphs evolve over time, and achieve more accurate predictions. We examine our model on two synthetic datasets as well as a real application dataset for monitoring oil-production equipment to capture different stages of the system, and achieve promising results.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Yan", "Jayant R.
