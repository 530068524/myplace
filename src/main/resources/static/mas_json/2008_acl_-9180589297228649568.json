{"title": "Semantic Class Learning from the Web with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs.", "fields": ["machine learning", "ranking", "world wide web", "popularity", "graph"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to weakly supervised semantic class learning from the web, using a single powerful hyponym pattern combined with graph structures, which capture two properties associated with pattern-based extractions: popularity and productivity. Intuitively, a candidate is popular if it was discovered many times by other instances in the hyponym pattern. A candidate is productive if it frequently leads to the discovery of other instances. Together, these two measures capture not only frequency of occurrence, but also cross-checking that the candidate occurs both near the class name and near other class members. We developed two algorithms that begin with just a class name and one seed instance and then automatically generate a ranked list of new class instances. We conducted experiments on four semantic classes and consistently achieved high accuracies.", "citation": "Citations (252)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Alicante", "University of Utah", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zornitsa Kozareva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozareva:Zornitsa", "Ellen Riloff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riloff:Ellen", "Eduard H.
