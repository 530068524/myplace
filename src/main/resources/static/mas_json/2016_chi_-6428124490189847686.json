{"title": "Sketching Shape-changing Interfaces: Exploring Vocabulary, Metaphors Use, and Affordances.", "fields": ["vocabulary", "user interface", "affordance", "mobile phone", "design elements and principles"], "abstract": "Shape-changing interfaces allow designers to create user interfaces that physically change shape. However, presently, we lack studies of how such interfaces are designed, as well as what high-level strategies, such as metaphors and affordances, designers use. This paper presents an analysis of sketches made by 21 participants designing either a shape-changing radio or a shape-changing mobile phone. The results exhibit a range of interesting design elements, and the analysis points to a need to further develop or revise existing vocabularies for sketching and analyzing movement. The sketches show a prevalent use of metaphors, say, for communicating volume though big-is-on and small-is-off, as well as a lack of conventions. Furthermore, the affordances used were curiously asymmetrical compared to those offered by non-shape-changing interfaces. We conclude by offering implications on how our results can influence future research on shape-changing interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "University of Copenhagen", "Aarhus University", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Majken Kirkegaard Rasmussen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rasmussen:Majken_Kirkegaard", "Giovanni Maria Troiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Troiano:Giovanni_Maria", "Marianne Graves Petersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petersen:Marianne_Graves", "Jakob Grue Simonsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simonsen:Jakob_Grue", "Kasper Hornb\u00e6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hornb=aelig=k:Kasper"], "pages": 12}
