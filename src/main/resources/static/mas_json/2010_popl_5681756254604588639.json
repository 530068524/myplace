Broadly, these fall into two groups: some follow Findler and Felleisen in using  latent   contracts, purely dynamic checks that are transparent to the type system; others use  manifest   contracts, where  refinement   types record the most recent check that has been applied to each value. These two approaches are commonly assumed to be equivalent---different ways of implementing the same idea, one retaining a simple type system, and the other providing more static information. Our goal is to formalize and clarify this folklore understanding.   Our work extends that of Gronski and Flanagan, who defined a latent calculus \u03bb  C   and a manifest calculus \u03bb  H  , gave a translation \u03c6 from \u03bb  C   to \u03bb  H  , and proved that, if a \u03bb  C   term reduces to a constant, then so does its \u03c6-image. We enrich their account with a translation \u03a8 from \u03bb  H   to \u03bb  C   and prove an analogous theorem.   We then generalize the whole framework to  dependent contracts  , whose predicates can mention free variables. This extension is both pragmatically crucial, supporting a much more interesting range of contracts, and theoretically challenging. We define dependent versions of \u03bb  H   and two dialects (\"lax\" and \"picky\") of \u03bb  C  , establish type soundness---a substantial result in itself, for \u03bb  H  ---and extend \u03c6 and \u03a8 accordingly. Surprisingly, the intuition that the latent and manifest systems are equivalent now breaks down: the extended translations preserve behavior in one direction but, in the other, sometimes yield terms that blame more.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Michael Greenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenberg_0002:Michael", "Benjamin C.
