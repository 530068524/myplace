{"title": "Sonic Millip3De: A massively parallel 3D-stacked accelerator for 3D ultrasound.", "fields": ["3d ultrasound", "delay calculation", "systems architecture", "data parallelism", "power budget"], "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound is becoming common for non-invasive medical imaging because of its high accuracy, safety, and ease of use. Unlike other modalities, ultrasound transducers require little power, which makes hand-held imaging platforms possible, and several low-resolution 2D devices are commercially available today. However, the extreme computational requirements (and associated power requirements) of 3D ultrasound image formation has, to date, precluded hand-held 3D capable devices. We describe the Sonic Millip3De, a new system architecture and accelerator for 3D ultrasound beamformation-the most computationally intensive aspect of image formation. Our three-layer die-stacked design features a custom beamsum accelerator that employs massive data parallelism and a streaming transform-select-reduce pipeline architecture enabled by our new iterative beamsum delay calculation algorithm. Based on RTL-level design and floorplanning for an industrial 45nm process, we show Sonic Millip3De can enable 3D ultrasound with a fully sampled 128\u00d796 transducer array within a 16W full-system power budget (400\u00d7 less than a conventional DSP solution) and will meet a 5W safe power target by the 11nm node.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Richard Sampson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sampson:Richard", "Ming Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0004:Ming", "Siyuan Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Siyuan", "Chaitali Chakrabarti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakrabarti:Chaitali", "Thomas F.
