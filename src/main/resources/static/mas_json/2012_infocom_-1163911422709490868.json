To provide this service, a polynomial-based scheme was recently introduced. However, this scheme and its extensions all have the weakness of a built-in threshold determined by the degree of the polynomial: when the number of messages transmitted is larger than this threshold, the adversary can fully recover the polynomial. In this paper, we propose a scalable authentication scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). While enabling intermediate node authentication, our proposed scheme allows any node to transmit an unlimited number of messages without suffering the threshold problem. In addition, our scheme can also provide message source privacy. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is more efficient than the polynomial-based approach in terms of communication and computational overhead under comparable security levels while providing message source privacy.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Temple University"], "authors": ["Yun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yun", "Jian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0007:Jian", "Jian Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren_0001:Jian", "Jie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Jie"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
