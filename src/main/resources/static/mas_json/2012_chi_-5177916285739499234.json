Particularly, by looking at how people make choices and decisions regarding TV watching in everyday life, we highlight material and digital properties of new media TV, and how they support and condition actions and interactions around them. The study illustrates that materiality and digitality are complementary, instead of one substituting the other, and are highly intertwined in the hybrid media environment around which meaningful experiences are conditioned and produced. It also suggests that an analytic distinction between materiality and digitality is fruitful in unpacking the complex relations between media technologies and social experiences.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Qi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qi", "Xianghua Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Xianghua", "Tun Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Tun", "Ning Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Ning"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
