{"title": "An ephemeral burst-buffer file system for scientific applications.", "fields": ["world wide web", "pipeline", "science technology and society", "pci express", "ephemeral key", "file system", "search engine", "batch processing"], "abstract": "Burst buffers are becoming an indispensable hardware resource on large-scale supercomputers to buffer the bursty I/O from scientific applications. However, there is a lack of software support for burst buffers to be efficiently shared by applications within a batch-submitted job and recycled across different batch jobs. In addition, burst buffers need to cope with a variety of challenging I/O patterns from data-intensive scientific applications. In this study, we have designed an ephemeral Burst Buffer File System (BurstFS) that supports scalable and efficient aggregation of I/O bandwidth from burst buffers while having the same life cycle as a batch-submitted job. BurstFS features several techniques including scalable metadata indexing, co-located I/O delegation, and server-side read clustering and pipelining. Through extensive tuning and analysis, we have validated that BurstFS has accomplished our design objectives, with linear scalability in terms of aggregated I/O bandwidth for parallel writes and reads.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Florida State University", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Florida State University"], "authors": ["Teng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Teng", "Kathryn Mohror.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohror:Kathryn", "Adam Moody.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moody:Adam", "Kento Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Kento", "Weikuan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Weikuan"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
