{"title": "Technology comparison for large last-level caches (L", "fields": ["edram", "low power electronics", "magnetoresistive random access memory", "static random access memory", "cpu cache"], "abstract": "Large last-level caches (L 3 Cs) are frequently used to bridge the performance and power gap between processor and memory. Although traditional processors implement caches as SRAMs, technologies such as STT-RAM (MRAM), and eDRAM have been used and/or considered for the implementation of L 3 Cs. Each of these technologies has inherent weaknesses: SRAM is relatively low density and has high leakage current; STT-RAM has high write latency and write energy consumption; and eDRAM requires refresh operations. As future processors are expected to have larger last-level caches, the goal of this paper is to study the trade-offs associated with using each of these technologies to implement L 3 Cs. In order to make useful comparisons between SRAM, STTRAM, and eDRAM L 3 Cs, we model them in detail and apply low power techniques to each of these technologies to address their respective weaknesses. We optimize SRAM for low leakage and optimize STT-RAM for low write energy. Moreover, we classify eDRAM refresh-reduction schemes into two categories and demonstrate the effectiveness of using dead-line prediction to eliminate unnecessary refreshes. A comparison of these technologies through full-system simulation shows that the proposed refresh-reduction method makes eDRAM a viable, energy-efficient technology for implementing L 3 Cs.", "citation": "Citations (182)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Intel", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Mu-Tien Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Mu=Tien", "Paul Rosenfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenfeld:Paul", "Shih-Lien Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Shih=Lien", "Bruce Jacob.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacob:Bruce"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
