We find that polite requests and button texts pointing to a voluntary decision  decrease  the probability of consent---in contrast to findings in social psychology. Our data suggests that  subtle positive  effects of polite requests indeed exist, but  stronger negative  effects of heuristic processing dominate the aggregated results. Participants seem to be habituated to coercive interception dialogs---presumably due to ubiquitous EULAs---and blindly accept terms the more their presentation resembles a EULA. Response latency and consultation of online help were taken as indicators to distinguish more systematic from heuristic responses.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["International Computer Science Institute", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Rainer B\u00f6hme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hme:Rainer", "Stefan K\u00f6psell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=psell:Stefan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
