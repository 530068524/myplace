We conducted two studies to investigate user's printing behavior. A key finding of the first study was that users often need an intermediate state between the electronic and physical forms of their documents. The second study examined users' predictions of which types of documents required this intermediate state. We formulate these findings into design guidelines that take into account:  examination phase, transitions, cognitive and emotional reasons , and  task- and event-relevant documents . Finally, we discuss how the different physical characteristics of reusable paper affect the user interface and could effectively support sustainable design.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Julie Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner:Julie", "Wendy E.
