It is therefore common practice to emulate the asymmetry of traditional public key based cryptographic services through a set of protocols [1] using symmetric key based message authentication codes (MACs). Although the low computational complexity of MACs is advantageous, the protocol layer requires time synchronization between devices on the network and a significant amount of overhead for communication and temporary storage. The requirement for a general purpose CPU to implement these protocols as well as their complexity makes them prone to vulnerabilities and practically eliminates all the advantages of using symmetric key techniques in the first place. In this paper we challenge the basic assumptions about public key cryptography in sensor networks which are based on a traditional software based approach. We propose a custom hardware assisted approach for which we claim that it makes public key cryptography feasible in such environments, provided we use the right selection of algorithms and associated parameters, careful optimization, and low-power design techniques. In order to validate our claim we present proof of concept implementations of two different algorithms\u2014Rabin\u2019s Scheme and NtruEncrypt\u2014and analyze their architecture and performance according to various established metrics like power consumption, area, delay, throughput, level of security and energy per bit. Our implementation of NtruEncrypt in ASIC standard cell logic uses no more than 3,000 gates with an average power consumption of less than 20 \u03bcW. We envision that our public key core would be embedded into a light-weight sensor node architecture.", "citation": "Citations (432)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University College London", "New York University", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "IBM", "New York University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "University of Fukui", "Kansai University", "Syst.
