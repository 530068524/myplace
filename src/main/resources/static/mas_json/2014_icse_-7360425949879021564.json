{"title": "Lifting model transformations to product lines.", "fields": ["code generation", "model driven architecture", "systems engineering", "code refactoring", "software"], "abstract": "Software product lines and model transformations are two techniques used in industry for managing the development of highly complex software. Product line approaches simplify the handling of software variants while model transformations automate software manipulations such as refactoring, optimization, code generation, etc. While these techniques are well understood independently, combining them to get the benefit of both poses a challenge because most model transformations apply to individual models while model-level product lines represent sets of models. In this paper, we address this challenge by providing an approach for automatically ``lifting'' model transformations so that they can be applied to product lines. We illustrate our approach using a case study and evaluate it through a set of experiments.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Rick Salay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salay:Rick", "Michalis Famelis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Famelis:Michalis", "Julia Rubin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubin:Julia", "Alessio Di Sandro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandro:Alessio_Di", "Marsha Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Marsha"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
