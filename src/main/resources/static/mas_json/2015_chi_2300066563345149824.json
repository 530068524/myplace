{"title": "Lessons Learnt from Deploying an End-User Development Platform for Physical Rehabilitation.", "fields": ["rehabilitation", "end user development", "end user", "software deployment", "personalization"], "abstract": "Clinical researchers in rehabilitation technology have often called for exercise customization to address patient specific needs. Where such customization transcends simple parameter setting, the need for End-User Development (EUD) arises. EUD in this field can potentially tap on the expertise of highly skilled workers, but presents serious challenges regarding acceptance by end users and the feasibility of embedding EUD in their professional practice. This paper describes the deployment and adoption process of TagTrainer, a physical rehabilitation technology that supports EUD. TagTrainer was deployed in four rehabilitation clinics and was used by 24 rehabilitation therapists. We analyze how they engaged in EUD activities and we discuss decisions that we took in the design and deployment of TagTrainer. Based on these case studies, we present guidelines for the deployment of EUD systems.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Jesse Hospital, ... asselt, Belgium", "MS Reva Overpel ... erpelt, Belgium"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Tetteroo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tetteroo:Daniel", "Paul Vreugdenhil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vreugdenhil:Paul", "Ivor Grisel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grisel:Ivor", "Marc Michielsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michielsen:Marc", "Els Kuppens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuppens:Els", "Diana Vanmulken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanmulken:Diana", "Panos Markopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markopoulos:Panos"], "pages": 10}
