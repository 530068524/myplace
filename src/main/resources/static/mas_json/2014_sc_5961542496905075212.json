Such computational geometry methods are common in data analysis and visualization, but as the scale of simulations and observations surpasses billions of particles, the existing serial and shared memory algorithms no longer suffice. A distributed-memory scalable parallel algorithm is the only feasible approach. The primary contribution of this paper is a new parallel Delaunay and Voronoi tessellation algorithm that automatically determines which neighbor points need to be exchanged among the sub domains of a spatial decomposition. Other contributions include periodic and wall boundary conditions, comparison of our method using two popular serial libraries, and application to numerous science datasets.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Argonne National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Tom Peterka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peterka:Tom", "Dmitriy Morozov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morozov:Dmitriy", "Carolyn L.
