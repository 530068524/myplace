STORM supports  interactive  spatio-temporal analytics through novel spatial online sampling techniques. Online spatio-temporal aggregation and analytics are then derived based on the online samples, where approximate answers with approximation quality guarantees can be provided immediately from the start of query execution. The quality of these online approximations improve over time. This demonstration proposal describes key ideas in the design of the STORM system, and presents the demonstration plan.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Utah", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "Hong Kong, Hong ...
