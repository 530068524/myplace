{"title": "De-duping URLs with Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Networks.", "fields": ["rewrite engine", "web crawler", "semantic url", "url normalization", "architecture"], "abstract": "Many URLs on the Internet point to identical contents, which increase the burden of web crawlers. Techniques that detect such URLs (known as URL de-duping) can greatly save resources such as bandwidth and storage for crawlers. Traditional de-duping methods are usually limited to heavily engineered rule matching strategies.In this work, we propose a novel URL de-duping framework based on sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural networks. A single concise translation model can take the place of thousands of explicit rules. Experiments indicate that a vanilla Seq2Seq architecture yields robust and accurate results in detecting duplicate URLs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of this framework in the real large-scale web environment.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Keyang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Keyang", "Zhengzhong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhengzhong", "Jamie Callan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Callan:Jamie"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
