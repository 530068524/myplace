{"title": "Lazy Abstractions for Timed Automata.", "fields": ["reachability problem", "timed automaton", "abstraction", "parametrization", "search tree"], "abstract": "We consider the reachability problem for timed automata. A standard solution to this problem involves computing a search tree whose nodes are abstractions of zones. For efficiency reasons, they are parametrized by the maximal lower and upper bounds (LU-bounds) occurring in the guards of the automaton. We propose an algorithm that dynamically updates LU-bounds during exploration of the search tree. In order to keep them as small as possible, the bounds are refined only when they enable a transition that is impossible in the unabstracted system. So our algorithm can be seen as a kind of lazy CEGAR algorithm for timed automata. We show that on several standard benchmarks, the algorithm is capable of keeping very small LU-bounds, and in consequence is able to reduce the search space substantially.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["L'Abri", "RWTH Aachen University", "L'Abri"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Herbreteau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herbreteau:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "B.
