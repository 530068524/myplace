We model the context using Conceptual Graphs (CG) based on an ontology. Including CG in our scene manager (Virtools) allows us to add semantic information and to describe the available tools. We handle rules leading to adaptation with a logic programming layer (Prolog+CG) included in the Amine platform. This project is a step towards Intelligent Virtual Environments, which proposes a hybrid solution by adding a separate semantic reasoning to classic environments. The first case study automatically manages few modalities depending on the distance to objects, user movement, available tools and modality risks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["IBISC Laborator ... versity, France", "IBISC Laborator ... versity, France", "IBISC Laborator ... versity, France", "IBISC Laborator ... versity, France"], "authors": ["Yannick Dennemont.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dennemont:Yannick", "Guillaume Bouyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouyer:Guillaume", "Samir Otmane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otmane:Samir", "Malik Mallem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mallem:Malik"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
