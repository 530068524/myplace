Traditional power management subsystems have been extended for smartphones and other portable devices, with the intention of maximizing the time that the devices are in a low-power \"sleep\" state. The approaches taken by these subsystems prove inefficient for many short-lived tasks common to portable devices, e.g., querying a sensor or polling a cloud service.   We introduce Drowsy, a new power management state that replaces \"awake.\" In the Drowsy state, not all system components are woken up, only the minimal set required for a pending task(s). Drowsy constructs and maintains the minimal task set by dynamically and continuously inferring dependencies between system components at run-time. We have implemented Drowsy within Android, and our results show a significant improvement (1.5-5x) in energy efficiency for common short-lived tasks.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Matthew Lentz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lentz:Matthew", "James Litton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Litton:James", "Bobby Bhattacharjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacharjee:Bobby"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
