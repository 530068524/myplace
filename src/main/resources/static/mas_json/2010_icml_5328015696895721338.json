In this paper, we present a class of probabilistic models that use these links as a form of naturally occurring supervision. These models allow us to substantially improve performance for core text processing tasks, such as morphological segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing. Besides these traditional NLP tasks, we also present a multilingual model for the computational decipherment of lost languages.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Vassar College", "Vassar College"], "authors": ["Benjamin Snyder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snyder:Benjamin", "Regina Barzilay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barzilay:Regina"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
