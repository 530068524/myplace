{"title": "Verifying component and connector models against crosscutting structural views.", "fields": ["engineering drawing", "input output", "scalability", "cable gland", "computer science", "polynomial", "port"], "abstract": "The structure of component and connector (C&C) models, which are used in many application domains of software engineering, consists of components at different containment levels, their typed input and output ports, and the connectors between them. C&C views, which we have presented at FSE'13, can be used to specify structural properties of C&C models in an expressive and intuitive way.     In this work we address the verification of a C&C model against a C&C view and present efficient (polynomial) algorithms to decide satisfaction. A unique feature of our work, not present in existing approaches to checking structural properties of C&C models, is the generation of witnesses for satisfaction/non-satisfaction and of short natural-language texts, which serve to explain and formally justify the verification results and point the engineer to its causes.     A prototype tool and an evaluation over four example systems with multiple views, performance and scalability experiments, as well as a user study of the usefulness of the witnesses for engineers, demonstrate the contribution of our work to the state-of-the-art in component and connector modeling and analysis.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Shahar Maoz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maoz:Shahar", "Jan Oliver Ringert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ringert:Jan_Oliver", "Bernhard Rumpe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rumpe:Bernhard"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
