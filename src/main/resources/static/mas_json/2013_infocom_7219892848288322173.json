However, its stability performance in multi-channel multi-radio (MC-MR) wireless networks is largely under-explored. In this paper, we present a stability subregion with closed form of a static greedy link scheduling in MC-MR wireless networks under the 802.11 interference model. By adopting some special static link orderings, the stability subregion is within a constant factor of the stable capacity region of the network. We also obtain constant lower bounds on the throughput efficiency ratios of the static greedy link schedulings in some special static link orderings.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "Zhiguo Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Zhiguo", "Zhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhu", "XiaoHua Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:XiaoHua", "Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie", "Xiaohua Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Xiaohua"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
