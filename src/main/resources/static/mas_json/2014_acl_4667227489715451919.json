In this work, we present a frequencydriven paradigm for robust distributional semantics in terms of semantically cohesive lineal constituents, or motifs. The framework subsumes issues such as differential compositional as well as noncompositional behavior of phrasal consituents, and circumvents some problems of data sparsity by design. We design a segmentation model to optimally partition a sentence into lineal constituents, which can be used to define distributional contexts that are less noisy, semantically more interpretable, and linguistically disambiguated. Hellinger PCA embeddings learnt using the framework show competitive results on empirical tasks.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shashank Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Shashank", "Eduard H.
