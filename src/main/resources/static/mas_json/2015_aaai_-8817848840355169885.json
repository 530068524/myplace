In this paper, we propose to synchronously learn the representations of individual words and extracted high-frequency phrases. Representations of extracted phrases are considered as gold standard for constructing more general operations to compose the representation of unseen phrases. We propose a grammatical type specific model that improves the composition flexibility by adopting vector-tensor-vector operations. Our model embodies the compositional characteristics of traditional additive and multiplicative model. Empirical result shows that our model outperforms state-of-the-art composition methods in the task of computing phrase similarities.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yu Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yu", "Zhiyuan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Zhiyuan", "Maosong Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Maosong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
