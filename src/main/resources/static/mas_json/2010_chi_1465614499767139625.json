{"title": "Clutch-free panning and integrated pan-zoom control on touch-sensitive surfaces: the cyclostar approach.", "fields": ["panning", "clutch", "rubbing", "kinematics", "zoom"], "abstract": "This paper introduces two novel navigation techniques, CycloPan, for clutch-free 2D panning and browsing, and CycloZoom+, for integrated 2D panning and zooming. These techniques instantiate a more generic concept which we call Cyclo* (CycloStar). The basic idea is that users can exert closed-loop control over several continuous variables by voluntarily modulating the parameters of a sustained oscillation. Touch-sensitive surfaces tend to offer impoverished input resources. Cyclo* techniques seem particularly promising on these surfaces because oscillations have multiple geometrical and kinematic parameters many of which may be used as controls. While CycloPan and CycloZoom+ are compatible with each other and with much of the state of the art, our experimental evaluations suggest that these two novel techniques outperform flicking and rubbing techniques.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Sylvain Malacria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malacria:Sylvain", "Eric Lecolinet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lecolinet:Eric", "Yves Guiard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guiard:Yves"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
