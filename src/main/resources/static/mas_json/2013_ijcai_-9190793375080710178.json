Past work on Collaborative Filtering (CF) has either not addressed the ranking problem for binary relevance datasets, or not specifically focused on improving top-k recommendations. To solve the problem we propose a new CF approach, Collaborative Less-is-More Filtering (CLiMF). In CLiMF the model parameters are learned by directly maximizing the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which is a well-known information retrieval metric for capturing the performance of top-k recommendations. We achieve linear computational complexity by introducing a lower bound of the smoothed reciprocal rank metric. Experiments on two social network datasets show that CLiMF significantly outperforms a naive baseline and two state-of-the-art CF methods.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Delft University of Technology", "Telef\u00f3nica"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yue Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Yue", "Alexandros Karatzoglou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karatzoglou:Alexandros", "Linas Baltrunas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baltrunas:Linas", "Martha Larson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larson:Martha", "Nuria Oliver.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliver:Nuria", "Alan Hanjalic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanjalic:Alan"], "pages": 5}
