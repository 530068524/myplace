{"title": "Multimedia features for click prediction of new ads in display advertising.", "fields": ["advertising campaign", "attractiveness", "revenue", "predictive modelling", "display advertising"], "abstract": "Non-guaranteed display advertising (NGD) is a multi-billion dollar business that has been growing rapidly in recent years. Advertisers in NGD sell a large portion of their ad campaigns using performance dependent pricing models such as cost-per-click (CPC) and cost-per-action (CPA). An accurate prediction of the probability that users click on ads is a crucial task in NGD advertising because this value is required to compute the expected revenue. State-of-the-art prediction algorithms rely heavily on historical information collected for advertisers, users and publishers. Click prediction of new ads in the system is a challenging task due to the lack of such historical data. The objective of this paper is to mitigate this problem by integrating multimedia features extracted from display ads into the click prediction models. Multimedia features can help us capture the attractiveness of the ads with similar contents or aesthetics. In this paper we evaluate the use of numerous multimedia features (in addition to commonly used user, advertiser and publisher features) for the purposes of improving click prediction in ads with no history. We provide analytical results generated over billions of samples and demonstrate that adding multimedia features can significantly improve the accuracy of click prediction for new ads, compared to a state-of-the-art baseline model.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Oregon State University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Haibin Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Haibin", "Roelof van Zwol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwol:Roelof_van", "Javad Azimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azimi:Javad", "Eren Manavoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manavoglu:Eren", "Ruofei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ruofei", "Yang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yang", "Vidhya Navalpakkam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navalpakkam:Vidhya"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
