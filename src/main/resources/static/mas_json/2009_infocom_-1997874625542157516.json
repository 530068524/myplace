In this paper, we propose two novel online traffic classifiers - one based on Neyman-Pearson classification and one based on the Learning Satisfiability (LSAT) framework - that can provide class-specific performance guarantees on the false alarm and false discovery rates, respectively. We also present a preprocessor for our classifiers that predicts, after the reception of only a small number of packets, whether a flow will be 'large' (as defined by a network operator). Only these resource-intensive flows are passed to the classifier, greatly reducing the computation burden imposed. We validate our methodology by testing our approaches using traffic data provided by an ISP.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Daniel Nechay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nechay:Daniel", "Yvan Pointurier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pointurier:Yvan", "Mark Coates.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coates:Mark"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
