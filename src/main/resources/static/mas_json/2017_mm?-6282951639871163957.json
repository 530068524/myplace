{"title": "Exploring Outliers in Crowdsourced Ranking for QoE.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "ranking", "anomaly detection", "quality of experience", "outlier"], "abstract": "Outlier detection is a crucial part of robust evaluation for crowdsourceable assessment of Quality of Experience (QoE) and has attracted much attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose some simple and fast algorithms for outlier detection and robust QoE evaluation based on the nonconvex optimization principle. Several iterative procedures are designed with or without knowing the number of outliers in samples. Theoretical analysis is given to show that such procedures can reach statistically good estimates under mild conditions. Finally, experimental results with simulated and real-world crowdsourcing datasets show that the proposed algorithms could produce similar performance to Huber-LASSO approach in robust ranking, yet with nearly 8 or 90 times speed-up, without or with a prior knowledge on the sparsity size of outliers, respectively. Therefore the proposed methodology provides us a set of helpful tools for robust QoE evaluation with crowdsourcing data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Michigan State University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Qianqian Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Qianqian", "Ming Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Ming", "Chendi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chendi", "Jiechao Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Jiechao", "Qingming Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Qingming", "Yuan Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Yuan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
