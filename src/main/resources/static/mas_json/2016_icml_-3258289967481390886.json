Since modelling and learning the full MN structure may be hard, learning the links between two groups directly may be a preferable option. We introduce a novel concept called the partitioned ratio whose factorization directly associates with the Markovian properties of random variables across two groups. A simple oneshot convex optimization procedure is proposed for learning the sparse factorizations of the partitioned ratio and it is theoretically guaranteed to recover the correct inter-group structure under mild conditions. The performance of the proposed method is experimentally compared with the state of the artMNstructure learning methods using ROC curves. Real applications on analyzing bipartisanship in US congress and pairwise DNA/time-series alignments are also reported.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "University of Tokyo", "The Institute o ... , Tokyo, Japan", "The Institute o ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Song Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Song", "Taiji Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Taiji", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi", "Kenji Fukumizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukumizu:Kenji"], "pages": 10}
