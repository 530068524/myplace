{"title": "Using Social Dynamics to Make Individual Predictions: Variational Inference with a Stochastic Kinetic Model.", "fields": ["kinetic energy", "inference", "social system", "social dynamics", "social network"], "abstract": "Social dynamics is concerned primarily with interactions among individuals and the resulting group behaviors, modeling the temporal evolution of social systems via the interactions of individuals within these systems. In particular, the availability of large-scale data from social networks and sensor networks offers an unprecedented opportunity to predict state-changing events at the individual level. Examples of such events include disease transmission, opinion transition in elections, and rumor propagation. Unlike previous research focusing on the collective effects of social systems, this study makes efficient inferences at the individual level. In order to cope with dynamic interactions among a large number of individuals, we introduce the stochastic kinetic model to capture adaptive transition probabilities and propose an efficient variational inference algorithm the complexity of which grows linearly \u2014 rather than exponentially\u2014 with the number of individuals. To validate this method, we have performed epidemic-dynamics experiments on wireless sensor network data collected from more than ten thousand people over three years. The proposed algorithm was used to track disease transmission and predict the probability of infection for each individual. Our results demonstrate that this method is more efficient than sampling while nonetheless achieving high accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Zhen Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zhen", "Wen Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0001:Wen", "Sargur N.
