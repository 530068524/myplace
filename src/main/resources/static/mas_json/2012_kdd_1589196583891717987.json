{"title": "A simple methodology for soft cost-sensitive classification.", "fields": ["bayes error rate", "one class classification", "soft costs", "data set", "statistical classification"], "abstract": "Many real-world data mining applications need varying cost for different types of classification errors and thus call for cost-sensitive classification algorithms. Existing algorithms for cost-sensitive classification are successful in terms of minimizing the cost, but can result in a high error rate as the trade-off. The high error rate holds back the practical use of those algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel cost-sensitive classification methodology that takes both the cost and the error rate into account. The methodology, called soft cost-sensitive classification, is established from a multicriteria optimization problem of the cost and the error rate, and can be viewed as regularizing cost-sensitive classification with the error rate. The simple methodology allows immediate improvements of existing cost-sensitive classification algorithms. Experiments on the benchmark and the real-world data sets show that our proposed methodology indeed achieves lower test error rates and similar (sometimes lower) test costs than existing cost-sensitive classification algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica", "National Yang-Ming University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Te-Kang Jan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jan:Te=Kang", "Da-Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Da=Wei", "Chi-Hung Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chi=Hung", "Hsuan-Tien Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Hsuan=Tien"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
