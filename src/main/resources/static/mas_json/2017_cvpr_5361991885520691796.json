{"title": "Adaptive Class Preserving Representation for Image Classification.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "elastic net regularization", "discriminative model", "training set", "lasso"], "abstract": "In linear representation-based image classification, an unlabeled sample is represented by the entire training set. To obtain a stable and discriminative solution, regularization on the vector of representation coefficients is necessary. For example, the representation in sparse representation-based classification (SRC) uses L1 norm penalty as regularization, which is equal to lasso. However, lasso overemphasizes the role of sparseness while ignoring the inherent structure among samples belonging to a same class. Many recent developed representation classifications have adopted lasso-type regressions to improve the performance. In this paper, we propose the adaptive class preserving representation for classification (ACPRC). Our method is related to group lasso based classification but different in two key points: When training samples in a class are uncorrelated, ACPRC turns into SRC, when samples in a class are highly correlated, it obtains similar result as group lasso. The superiority of ACPRC over other state-of-the-art regularization techniques including lasso, group lasso, sparse group lasso, etc. are evaluated by extensive experiments.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": [], "authors": ["Jian-Xun Mi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mi:Jian=Xun", "Qiankun Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Qiankun", "Weisheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Weisheng"], "conf": "cvpr", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
