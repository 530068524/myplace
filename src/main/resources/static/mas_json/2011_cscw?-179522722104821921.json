Through a variety of Web services, people can get together on a virtual platform to video chat, edit documents, and engage in other activities; however, neighboring residents do not always have a chance to meet each other face-to-face. In our research, we focus on people living close to each other and try to encourage them to get together. We have attempted to encourage people to bring along their own ingredients to a get-together for cooking and eating according to \"Osusowake,\" a traditional Japanese ritual. We propose a menu-planning support system that utilizes the shared information of cooking ingredients owned by individuals.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "Hitachi"], "authors": ["Hideaki Kanai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanai:Hideaki", "Kei Kitahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kitahara:Kei"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
