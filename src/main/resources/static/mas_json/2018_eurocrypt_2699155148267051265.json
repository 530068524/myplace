The first two properties are straightforward to satisfy, while the third one requires us to make efficiency compromises. We can either work over rings where the polynomial \\(X^n+1\\) only splits into two irreducible factors modulo p, which makes the speed of the multiplication operation in the ring sub-optimal; or we can limit our challenge set to polynomials of smaller degree, which requires them to have (much) larger norms.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["IBM", "ETH Zurich", "IBM"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Vadim Lyubashevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyubashevsky:Vadim", "Gregor Seiler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seiler:Gregor"], "pages": 21}
