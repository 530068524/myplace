The key idea is to arrange all participants along a ring and equip them with long distance contacts drawn from a family of harmonic distributions. Through simulation, we demonstrate that our construction is scalable, flexible, stable in the presence of frequent updates and offers small average latency with only a handful of long distance links per node. The cost of updates when hosts join and leave is small.", "citation": "Citations (600)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Harvard University", "Princeton University", "University of Amsterdam", "University of California, Irvine", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Lund University", "Hoffmann-La Roche", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "Verity, Inc.", "Federal Univers ... o Paulo, Brazil", "IKEM, Prague, Czech Republic"], "authors": ["Erick Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Erick"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
