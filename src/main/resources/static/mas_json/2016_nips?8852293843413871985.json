Simple non-convex optimization algorithms are popular and effective in practice. Despite recent progress in proving various non-convex algorithms converge from a good initial point, it remains unclear why random or arbitrary initialization suffices in practice. We prove that the commonly used non-convex objective function for matrix completion has no spurious local minima \\--- all local minima must also be global. Therefore, many popular optimization algorithms such as (stochastic) gradient descent can provably solve matrix completion with \\textit{arbitrary} initialization in polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (171)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of California, Berkeley", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Rong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge_0001:Rong", "Jason D.
