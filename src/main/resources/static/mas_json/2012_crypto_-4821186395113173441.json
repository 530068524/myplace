Following the seminal work of Ishaii\u00be?et.i\u00be?al.i\u00be?Eurocrypt 2006, we consider adversaries who may choose an arbitrary set of wires to corrupt, and may set each such wire toi\u00be?0 or toi\u00be?1, or may toggle with the wire. We prove that such adversaries, who continuously tamper with the circuit, can learn at most logarithmically many bits of secret information in addition to black-box access to the circuit. Our results are information theoretic.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Dana Dachman-Soled.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dachman=Soled:Dana", "Yael Tauman Kalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalai:Yael_Tauman"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 19}
