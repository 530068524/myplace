{"title": "Adding haptic feature to YouTube.", "fields": ["haptic technology", "wearable computer", "output device", "feeling", "xml"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a web-based framework in which users can annotate tactile feeling to a YouTube video and experience the tactile feeling by wearing a tactile device while watching\\annotating the video. The tactile device is embedded into a wearable garment, a haptic jacket and a haptic arm band in this paper, and has a rectangular layout like a video screen. Therefore, the tactile information is represented as a sequence of rectangular arrays with time stamps and stored in XML format. Each element of the array represents a tactile intensity, a magnitude of actuation. In the framework we provide a web-based authoring tool to add tactile feeling while navigating a video and setting tactile intensity in a time line. We also introduce a web browser in which a tactile device driver is embedded to activate the tactile device based on the annotated tactile information.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa"], "authors": ["Md.
