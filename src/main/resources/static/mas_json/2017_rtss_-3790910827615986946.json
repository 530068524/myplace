{"title": "Memory Bank Partitioning for Fixed-Priority Tasks in a Multi-core System.", "fields": ["memory augmentation", "homogeneous", "memory bank", "speedup", "premise"], "abstract": "In a multi-core platform, resources, such as memory banks and buses, are mostly shared among all cores for power, performance, and cost reasons. The access interference on the shared resources poses a major challenge on the analysis of real-time properties, but can be alleviated if task data partition onto memory banks is applied with care. In this paper, we consider to schedule RAS (resource access sporadic) tasks onto a platform consisting of homogeneous cores and capacity-limited memory banks. According to our observation, we should avoid internal data spreading among the memory banks for a task while advocate external data spreading among memory banks for a given task set. We propose a two-phase algorithm with (4 + \u03c1 + 3(2\u03b3+1)/\u03b3) speedup factor and (\u03b3 + 1) memory augmentation factor, where \u03c1 \u03b3 0 and \u03c1 \u2265 1. The derived adjustable resource augmentation factors can be useful in terms of system synthesis and schedulability. Moreover, under the premise that a given task set is feasible, we devise a bi-section approach that can derive a schedulable solution requiring the least amount of memory augmentation. According to our experiment results, the proposed algorithm significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithm [15] in terms of schedulability test even when memory augmentation is prohibited.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "Technical University of Dortmund", "Saarland University", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Sheng-Wei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Sheng=Wei", "Jian-Jia Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jian=Jia", "Jan Reineke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reineke:Jan", "Tei-Wei Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Tei=Wei"], "pages": 11}
