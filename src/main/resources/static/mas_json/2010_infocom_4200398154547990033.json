{"title": "Netscope: Practical Network Loss Tomography.", "fields": ["unicast", "lossy compression", "planetlab", "network tomography", "overlay"], "abstract": "We present Netscope, a tomographic technique that infers the loss rates of network links from unicast end-to-end measurements. Netscope uses a novel combination of \ufb01rst- and second-order moments of end-to-end measurements to identify and characterize the links that cannot be (accurately) characterized through existing practical tomographic techniques. Using both analytical and experimental tools, we show that Netscope enables scalable, accurate link-loss inference: in a simulation scenario involving 4000 links, 20% of them lossy, Netscope correctly identi\ufb01es 94% of the lossy links with a false positive rate of 16%-a signi\ufb01cant improvement over the existing alternatives. Netscope is robust in the sense that it requires no parameter tuning, moreover its advantage over the alternatives widens when the number of lossy links increases. We also validate Netscope's performance on an \"Internet tomographer\" that we deployed on an overlay of 400 PlanetLab nodes.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Adelaide", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Denisa Ghita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghita:Denisa", "Hung Xuan Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hung_Xuan", "Maciej Kurant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurant:Maciej", "Katerina J.
