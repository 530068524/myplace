{"title": "Contrabass: Concurrent transmissions without coordination for ad hoc networks.", "fields": ["transmitter", "phy", "throughput", "scalability", "mimo"], "abstract": "A practical protocol jointly considering PHY and MAC for MIMO based concurrent transmissions in wireless ad hoc networks, called Contrabass, is presented. Concurrent transmissions refer to simultaneous transmissions by multiple nodes over the same carrier frequency within the same interference range. Contrabass is the first-to-date open-loop based concurrent transmission protocol which implements simultaneous channel training for concurrently transmitting links without any control message exchange. Its MAC protocol is designed for each active transmitter to independently decide to transmit with near optimal transmission probability. Contrabass maximizes the number of successful concurrent transmissions, thus achieving very high aggregate throughput, low delays and scalability even under dynamic environments. The design choices of Contrabass are deliberately made to enable practical implementation which is demonstrated through GNURadio implementation and experimentation.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "Gyeongsang National University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "The Boeing Company, USA"], "authors": ["Sungro Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Sungro", "Injong Rhee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhee:Injong", "Bang Chul Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Bang_Chul", "Babak Daneshrad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daneshrad:Babak", "Jae H.
