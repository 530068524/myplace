For example, a POI may exist outside the map or on a background with no meaningful cues. To address this issue, we present Personalized Compass, a self-contained compact graphical location indicator. Personalized Compass uses personal a priori POIs to establish a reference frame, within which a POI in question can then be localized. Graphically, a personalized compass combines a multi-needle compass with an abstract overview map. We analyze the characteristics of Personalized Compass and the existing Wedge technique, and report on a user study comparing them. Personalized Compass performs better for four inference tasks, while Wedge is better for a locating task. Based on our analysis and study results, we suggest the two techniques are complementary and offer design recommendations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Miau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miau:Daniel", "Steven Feiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feiner:Steven"], "pages": 12}
