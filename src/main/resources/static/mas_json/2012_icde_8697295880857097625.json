Most of the previous studies in this area use IR-style ranking, which fail to consider the importance of the query answers. In this paper, we propose \\cirank, a new approach for keyword search in databases, which considers the importance of individual nodes in a query answer and the cohesiveness of the result structure in a balanced way. \\cirank\\ is built upon a carefully designed model call Random Walk with Message Passing that helps capture the relationships between different nodes in the query answer. We develop a branch and bound algorithm to support the efficient generation of top-$k$ query answers. Indexing methods are also introduced to further speed up the run-time processing of queries. Extensive experiments conducted on two real data sets with a real user query log confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of \\cirank.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Shandong University", "York University"], "authors": ["Xiaohui Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Xiaohui", "Huxia Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Huxia"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
