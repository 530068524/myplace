The basic goal is to learn a sparse representation from an overcomplete basis set. Most existing approaches employ a convex relaxation scheme to tackle this challenge due to the strong ability of convexity in computation and theoretical analysis. In this paper we propose a non-convex online approach for dictionary learning. To achieve the sparseness, our approach treats a so-called minimax concave (MC) penalty as a nonconvex relaxation of the l 0  penalty. This treatment expects to obtain a more robust and sparse representation than existing convex approaches. In addition, we employ an online algorithm to adaptively learn the dictionary, which makes the non-convex formulation computationally feasible. Experimental results on the sparseness comparison and the applications in image denoising and image inpainting demonstrate that our approach is more effective and flexible.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Microsoft", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jianping Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jianping", "Xiang Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiang", "Guang Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Guang", "Jingdong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingdong", "Zhihua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihua"], "pages": 8}
