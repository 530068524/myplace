Such documents have, in addition to ordinary nodes,  distributional  nodes that specify the probabilistic process of generating a random document. Within this abstraction, families of pdocuments, which are natural extensions and combinations of previous models, are considered. The focus is on efficiency of applying twig queries (with projection) to p-documents. A closely related issue is the ability to (efficiently) translate a given document of one family into another family. Furthermore, both of these tasks have two variants that correspond to the  value-based  and  object-based  semantics.   The translation relationships among different families of p-documents are studied. An efficient algorithm for evaluating twig queries over one specific family is given. This algorithm generalizes a known algorithm and significantly improves its running time, both analytically and experimentally. It is shown that this family is the maximal, among the ones considered, for which query evaluation is tractable. For the rest, efficient approximate algorithms for query evaluation are presented.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Benny Kimelfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimelfeld:Benny", "Yuri Kosharovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosharovsky:Yuri", "Yehoshua Sagiv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sagiv:Yehoshua"], "pages": 14}
