{"title": "Predictive black-box mitigation of timing channels.", "fields": ["black box", "bounded function", "information flow", "timing attack", "leakage"], "abstract": "We investigate techniques for general black-box mitigation of timing channels. The source of events is wrapped by a timing mitigator that delays output events so that they contain only a bounded amount of information. We introduce a general class of timing mitigators that can achieve any given bound on timing channel leakage, with a tradeoff in system performance. We show these mitigators compose well with other mechanisms for information flow control, and demonstrate they are effective against some known timing attacks.", "citation": "Citations (141)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Aslan Askarov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Askarov:Aslan", "Danfeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Danfeng", "Andrew C.
