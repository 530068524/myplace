Under mild non-degeneracy conditions, we show that we can uniquely reconstruct the underlying chains by only considering trajectories of length three, which represent triples of states. Our algorithm is spectral in nature, and is easy to implement.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Yahoo!", "Google"], "authors": ["Rishi Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Rishi", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi", "Sergei Vassilvitskii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vassilvitskii:Sergei"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
