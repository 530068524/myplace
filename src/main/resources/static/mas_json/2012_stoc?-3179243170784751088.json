{"title": "Reconstruction of depth-4 multilinear circuits with top fan-in 2.", "fields": ["operator", "bounded function", "fan in", "randomized algorithm", "multilinear map"], "abstract": "We present a randomized algorithm for reconstructing multilinear \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3\u03a0(2) circuits, i.e., multilinear depth-4 circuits with fan-in 2 at the top + gate. The algorithm is given blackbox access to a polynomial f \u2208 F[x 1 ,...,x n ] computable by a multilinear \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3\u03a0(2) circuit of size s and outputs an equivalent multilinear \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3\u03a0(2) circuit, runs in time poly(n,s), and works over  any  field F. This is the first reconstruction result for any model of depth-4 arithmetic circuits. Prior to our work, reconstruction results for bounded depth circuits were known only for depth-2 arithmetic circuits (Klivans & Spielman, STOC 2001), \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3(2) circuits (depth-3 arithmetic circuits with top fan-in 2) (Shpilka, STOC 2007), and \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3(k) with k=O(1) (Karnin & Shpilka, CCC 2009). Moreover, the running times of these algorithms have a polynomial dependence on |F| and hence do not work for infinite fields such as Q.   Our techniques are quite different from the previous ones for depth-3 reconstruction and rely on a polynomial operator introduced by Karnin et al. (STOC 2010) and Saraf & Volkovich (STOC 2011) for devising blackbox identity tests for multilinear \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3\u03a0(k) circuits. Some other ingredients of our algorithm include the classical multivariate blackbox factoring algorithm by Kaltofen & Trager (FOCS 1988) and an  average-case  algorithm for reconstructing \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3(2) circuits by Kayal.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ankit Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta_0001:Ankit", "Neeraj Kayal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kayal:Neeraj", "Satyanarayana V.
