{"title": "Differentially private publication of general time-serial trajectory data.", "fields": ["data publishing", "merge", "leverage", "scalability", "differential privacy"], "abstract": "Trajectory data, i.e., human mobility traces, is extremely valuable for a wide range of mobile applications. However, publishing raw trajectories without special sanitization poses serious threats to individual privacy. Recently, researchers begin to leverage differential privacy to solve this challenge. Nevertheless, existing mechanisms make an implicit assumption that the trajectories contain a lot of identical prefixes or n-grams, which is not true in many applications. This paper aims to remove this assumption and propose a differentially private publishing mechanism for more general time-series trajectories. One natural solution is to generalize the trajectories, i.e., merge the locations at the same time. However, trivial merging schemes may breach differential privacy. We, thus, propose the first differentially-private generalization algorithm for trajectories, which leverage a carefully-designed exponential mechanism to probabilistically merge nodes based on trajectory distances. Afterwards, we propose another efficient algorithm to release trajectories after generalization in a differential private manner. Our experiments with real-life trajectory data show that the proposed mechanism maintains high data utility and is scalable to large trajectory datasets.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Jingyu Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Jingyu", "Yue Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yue", "Sheng Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Sheng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
