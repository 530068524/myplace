{"title": "An HDP-HMM for systems with state persistence.", "fields": ["hierarchical dirichlet process", "nonparametric statistics", "speaker diarisation", "synthetic data", "persistence"], "abstract": "The hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) is a flexible, nonparametric model which allows state spaces of unknown size to be learned from data. We demonstrate some limitations of the original HDP-HMM formulation (Teh et al., 2006), and propose a  sticky  extension which allows more robust learning of smoothly varying dynamics. Using DP mixtures, this formulation also allows learning of more complex, multimodal emission distributions. We further develop a sampling algorithm that employs a truncated approximation of the DP to jointly resample the full state sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Via extensive experiments with synthetic data and the NIST speaker diarization database, we demonstrate the advantages of our sticky extension, and the utility of the HDP-HMM in real-world applications.", "citation": "Citations (258)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Emily B.
