This problem may be seen as a natural generalisation of the quantified constraint satisfaction problem QCSP(D). We obtain a tetrachotomy for arbitrary finite structures: each problem is either in L, is NP-complete, is co-NP-complete or is P space-complete. Moreover, its complexity is characterised algebraically in terms of the presence or absence of specific surjective hyper-endomorphisms, and, logically, in terms of relativisation properties with respect to positive equality-free sentences. We prove that the meta-problem, to establish for a specific D into which of the four classes the related problem lies, is NP-hard.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Durham University", "LIMOS, Clermont ... lermont, France"], "authors": ["Florent R.
