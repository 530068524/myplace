{"title": "Towards a General Rule for Identifying Deceptive Opinion Spam.", "fields": ["operator", "marketing", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Consumers\u2019 purchase decisions are increasingly influenced by user-generated online reviews. Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potential for posting deceptive opinion spam\u2014 fictitious reviews that have been deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader. In this paper, we explore generalized approaches for identifying online deceptive opinion spam based on a new gold standard dataset, which is comprised of data from three different domains (i.e. Hotel, Restaurant, Doctor), each of which contains three types of reviews, i.e. customer generated truthful reviews, Turker generated deceptive reviews and employee (domain-expert) generated deceptive reviews. Our approach tries to capture the general difference of language usage between deceptive and truthful reviews, which we hope will help customers when making purchase decisions and review portal operators, such as TripAdvisor or Yelp, investigate possible fraudulent activity on their sites. 1", "citation": "Citations (107)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jiwei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiwei", "Myle Ott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ott:Myle", "Claire Cardie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cardie:Claire", "Eduard H.
