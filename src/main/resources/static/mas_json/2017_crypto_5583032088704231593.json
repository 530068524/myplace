In this work we investigate the feasibility of protocols with sublinear communication complexity. Concretely, we consider two clients, one of which may be corrupted, who wish to perform some \u201csmall\u201d joint computation using n servers but without any trusted setup. We show that enforcing sublinear communication complexity drastically affects the feasibility bounds on the number of corrupted parties that can be tolerated in the setting of information-theoretic security.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "authors": ["Juan A.
