{"title": "Stackelberg Planning: Towards Effective Leader-Follower State Space Search.", "fields": ["heuristic", "machine learning", "robustness", "state space search", "stackelberg competition"], "abstract": "Inspired by work on Stackelberg security games, we introduce Stackelberg planning, where a leader player in a classical planning task chooses a minimum-cost action sequence aimed at maximizing the plan cost of a follower player in the same task. Such Stackelberg planning can provide useful analyses not only in planning-based security applications like network penetration testing, but also to measure robustness against perturbances in more traditional planning applications (eg with a leader sabotaging road network connections in transportation-type domains). To identify all equilibria\u2013exhibiting the leader's own-cost-vs.-follower-cost tradeoff\u2013we design leader-follower search, a state space search at the leader level which calls in each state an optimal planner at the follower level. We devise simple heuristic guidance, branch-and-bound style pruning, and partial-order reduction techniques for this setting. We run experiments on Stackelberg variants of IPC and pentesting benchmarks. In several domains, Stackelberg planning is quite feasible in practice.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Patrick Speicher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Speicher:Patrick", "Marcel Steinmetz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinmetz:Marcel", "Michael Backes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Backes_0001:Michael", "J\u00f6rg Hoffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoffmann_0001:J=ouml=rg", "Robert K\u00fcnnemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=uuml=nnemann:Robert"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
