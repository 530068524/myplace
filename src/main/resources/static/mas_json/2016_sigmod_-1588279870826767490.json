{"title": "RxSpatial: Reactive Spatial Library for Real-Time Location Tracking and Processing.", "fields": ["geospatial analysis", "computation", "server side", "object based spatial database", "spatial database"], "abstract": "Current commercial spatial libraries implemented strong support on functionalities like intersection, distance, and area for various stationary geospatial objects. The missing point is the support for moving object. Performing moving object real-time location tracking and computation on server side of GIS application is challenging because of high user volume of moving object to track, time complexity of analysis and computation, and requirement of real-timing. In this Demo, we present the RxSpatial, a real time reactive spatial library that consists of (1) a front-end, a programming interface for developers who are familiar with the Reactive framework and the Microsoft Spatial Library, and (2) a back-end for processing spatial operations in a streaming fashion. Then we provide the demonstration scenarios that show how RxSpatial is employed in real-world applications. The demonstration scenarios include criminal activity tracking, collaborative vehicle system, performance analysis and an interactive internal inspection.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Virginia", "Microsoft", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Youying Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Youying", "Abdeltawab M.
