{"title": "An almost-optimally fair three-party coin-flipping protocol.", "fields": ["cryptography", "combinatorics", "mathematics", "computer science", "discrete mathematics", "coin flipping", "state of affairs"], "abstract": "In a multiparty  fair  coin-flipping protocol, the parties output a common (close to) unbiased bit, even when some corrupted parties try to bias the output. Cleve [STOC 1986] has shown that in the case of dishonest majority (i.e., at least half of the parties can be corrupted), in  any m -round coin-flipping protocol, the corrupted parties can bias the honest parties' common output bit by \u03a9 (1/m) . For more than two decades, the best known coin-flipping protocols against dishonest majority had bias [EQUATION], where  e  is the number of corrupted parties. This was changed by a recent breakthrough result of Moran et al. [TCC 2009], who constructed an  m -round,  two -party coin-flipping protocol with optimal bias \u0398(1/m). In a subsequent work, Beimel et al. [Crypto 2010] extended this result to the multiparty case in which  less than  2/3 of the parties can be corrupted. Still for the case of 2/3 (or more) corrupted parties, the best known protocol had bias [EQUATION]. In particular, this was the state of affairs for the natural three-party case.   We make a step towards eliminating the above gap, presenting an  m -round, three-party coin-flipping protocol, with bias O(log 2 m)/m. Our approach (which we also apply for the two-party case) does not follow the \"threshold round\" paradigm used in the work of Moran et al. and Beimel et al., but rather is a variation of the majority protocol of Cleve, used to obtain the aforementioned [EQUATION]-bias protocol.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Iftach Haitner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haitner:Iftach", "Eliad Tsfadia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsfadia:Eliad"], "pages": 9}
