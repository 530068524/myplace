{"title": "Tilt menu: using the 3D orientation information of pen devices to extend the selection capability of pen-based user interfaces.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "user interface", "computer science", "usability"], "abstract": "We present a new technique called 'Tilt Menu' for better extending selection capabilities of pen-based interfaces. The Tilt Menu is implemented by using 3D orientation information of pen devices while performing selection tasks. The Tilt Menu has the potential to aid traditional one-handed techniques as it simultaneously generates the secondary input (e.g., a command or parameter selection) while drawing/interacting with a pen tip without having to use the second hand or another device. We conduct two experiments to explore the performance of the Tilt Menu. In the first experiment, we analyze the effect of parameters of the Tilt Menu, such as the menu size and orientation of the item, on its usability. Results of the first experiment suggest some design guidelines for the Tilt Menu. In the second experiment, the Tilt Menu is compared to two types of techniques while performing connect-the-dot tasks using freeform drawing mechanism. Results of the second experiment show that the Tilt Menu perform better in comparison to the Tool Palette, and is as good as the Toolglass.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Pennsylvania State University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Feng Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Feng", "Lishuang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Lishuang", "Hongan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hongan", "Xiaolong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Xiaolong", "Yuanyuan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yuanyuan", "Vidya Setlur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Setlur:Vidya", "Guozhong Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Guozhong"], "pages": 10}
