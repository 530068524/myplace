DroidRA first statically extracts reflection-related object values from a given Android app. Then, it leverages the extracted values to boost the app in a way that reflective calls are no longer a challenge for existing static analyzers. This is achieved through a bytecode instrumentation approach, where reflective calls are supplemented with explicit traditional Java method calls which can be followed by state-of-the-art analyzers which do not handle reflection. Instrumented apps can thus be completely analyzed by existing static analyzers, which are no longer required to be modified to support reflection-aware analysis. The video demo of DroidRA can be found at https://youtu.be/-HW0V68aAWc.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "Pennsylvania State University", "University of Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Li Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0029:Li", "Tegawend\u00e9 F.
