Our approach is based on using the connection between these relaxations and the Sum-of-Squares proof system to transform a  combining algorithm ---an algorithm that maps a distribution over solutions into a (possibly weaker) solution---into a rounding algorithm that maps a solution of the relaxation to a solution of the original problem.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Cornell University", "University of Bristol", "University of Barcelona", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "ICFO\u2014Institut d ... arcelona, Spain", "Institut f\u00fcr Th ... 69 Ulm, Germany"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Boaz Barak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barak:Boaz", "Jonathan A.
