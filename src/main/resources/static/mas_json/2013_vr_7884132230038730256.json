The limitation of these methods is that users can not interact with the equipments in a natural way, since people should operate the equipments according to certain rules which are arranged beforehand. This paper proposes a novel interaction system which contains a low cost full-field of view device to make sure users can see the display content from all directions. In addition, a tracking device is set up over users head to identify the user's natural gesture. A target following photography equipment is also combined with the system to provide on-line video chat and remote monitoring functions. Our system can be considered as a new form of human-computer interface and the advantages and potential are discussed in this paper. Finally, a demonstration and experimental results are given to evaluate the validity of the system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Dong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dong", "Jinghui Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jinghui", "Dongdong Weng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weng:Dongdong", "Yan Mo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mo:Yan"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
