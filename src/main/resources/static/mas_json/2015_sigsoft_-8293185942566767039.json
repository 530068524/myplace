This makes it difficult for researchers to assess if threats, such as missing themes or sample bias, have inadvertently materialized. To better assess such threats, our new idea is that we can automatically extract knowledge from social news websites, such as Hacker News, to easily replicate existing grounded theory research --- and then compare the results. We conduct a replication study on static analysis tool adoption using Hacker News. We confirm that even a basic replication and analysis using social news websites can offer additional insights to existing themes in studies, while also identifying new themes. For example, we identified that security was not a theme discovered in the original study on tool adoption. As a long-term vision, we consider techniques from the discipline of knowledge discovery to make this replication process more automatic.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["ABB Ltd", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Titus Barik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barik:Titus", "Brittany Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Brittany", "Emerson R.
