The network-on-chip (NoCs) has been proposed as a scalable and high-bandwidth fabric for interconnect design. The advent of the 3D technology has provided further opportunity to reduce on-chip communication delay. However, the design of the 3D NoC topologies has important distinctions from 2D NoCs or off-chip interconnection networks. First, current 3D stacking technology allows only vertical inter-layer links. Hence, there cannot be direct connections between arbitrary nodes in different layers \u2014 the vertical connection topology are essentially fixed. Second, the 3D NoC is highly constrained by the complexity and power of routers and links. Hence, low-radix routers are preferred over high-radix routers for lower power and better heat dissipation. This implies long network latency due to high hop counts in network paths. In this paper, we design a low-diameter 3D network using low-radix routers. Our topology leverages long wires to connect remote intra-layer nodes. We take advantage of the start-of-the-art one-hop vertical communication design and utilize lateral long wires to shorten network paths. Effectively, we implement a small-to-medium sized clique network in different layers of a 3D chip. The resulting topology generates a diameter of 3-hop only network, using routers of the same radix as 3D mesh routers. The proposed network shows up to 29% of network latency reduction, up to 10% throughput improvement, and up to 24% energy reduction, when compared to a 3D mesh network.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Yi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yi", "Yu Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Yu", "Bo Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0007:Bo", "Xiuyi Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiuyi", "Youtao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Youtao", "Jun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Jun"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2009", "pages": 13}
