In this paper, we show that it is practical to verify dynamic properties of infinite state models expressed in a subset of CTL directly using an SMT solver without iteration, abstraction, or human intervention. We call this subset CTL-Live and it consists of the operators of CTL expressible using the least fixed point operator of the mu-calculus, which are commonly considered liveness properties (e.g., AF, AU). We show that using this method the verification of an infinite state model can sometimes complete more quickly than verifying a finite version of the model. We also examine modelling techniques to represent abstract models in first-order logic that facilitate this form of model checking.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Amirhossein Vakili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vakili:Amirhossein", "Nancy A.
