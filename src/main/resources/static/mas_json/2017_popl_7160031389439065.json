This model is an instance of a new framework which captures not only quantum but also classical and  probabilistic  computation. Its main feature is the ability to model  commutative effects  in a  parallel  setting. Our model comes with a multi-token machine, a proof net system, and a -style language. Being based on a multi-token machine equipped with a memory, it has a concrete nature which makes it well suited for building low-level operational descriptions of higher-order languages.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Ugo Dal Lago.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lago:Ugo_Dal", "Claudia Faggian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faggian:Claudia", "Beno\u00eet Valiron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valiron:Beno=icirc=t", "Akira Yoshimizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshimizu:Akira"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
