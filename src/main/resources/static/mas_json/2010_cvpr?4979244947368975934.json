{"title": "Image restoration and disparity estimation from an uncalibrated multi-layered image.", "fields": ["binary image", "image restoration", "image formation", "feature detection", "image texture"], "abstract": "Watching a reflection in a glass window, one can often observe a multi-layered image consisting of a front-surface reflection from the glass and a rear-surface reflection through the glass. That multi-layered image is a composition of dual aspects of the same image, resembling a sound reverberation. As described herein, we propose a method to estimate the original reflection image before the layering. First, we model the multi-layered image generation process; then we derive a restoration filter by assuming that the displacement between the multiple reflection images in the single multi-layered image is known. Second, we propose a method to estimate the original image in conjunction with the displacement estimation. The displacement between the reflection images in a single multi-layered image includes scene depth information. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using both synthetic and real multi-layered images.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Olympus Corporation", "Nihon University", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Takahiro Yano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yano:Takahiro", "Masao Shimizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimizu:Masao", "Masatoshi Okutomi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okutomi:Masatoshi"], "pages": 8}
