{"title": "Improving social relationships in face-to-face human-agent interactions: when the agent wants to know user's likes and dislikes.", "fields": ["face to face", "natural language processing", "expression", "annotation", "sentence"], "abstract": "This paper tackles the issue of the detection of user\u2019s verbal expressions of likes and dislikes in a human-agent interaction. We present a system grounded on the theoretical framework provided by (Martin and White, 2005) that integrates the interaction context by jointly processing agent\u2019s and user\u2019s utterances. It is designed as a rule-based and bottom-up process based on a symbolic representation of the structure of the sentence. This article also describes the annotation campaign \u2013 carried out through Amazon Mechanical Turk \u2013 for the creation of the evaluation dataset. Finally, we present all measures for rating agreement between our system and the human reference and obtain agreement scores that are equal or higher than substantial agreements.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Caroline Langlet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langlet:Caroline", "Chlo\u00e9 Clavel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clavel:Chlo=eacute="], "pages": 10}
