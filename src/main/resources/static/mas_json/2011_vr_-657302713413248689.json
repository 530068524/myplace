This approach is based on an error-state Kalman filter algorithm using both relative (local) measurements obtained from image based motion estimation through visual odometry, and global measurements as a result of landmark matching through a pre-built visual landmark database. To improve the accuracy in pose estimation for augmented reality applications, we capture the 3D local reconstruction uncertainty of each landmark point as a covariance matrix and implicity rely more on closer points in the filter. We conduct a number of experiments aimed at evaluating different aspects of our Kalman filter framework, and show our approach can provide highly-accurate and stable pose both indoors and outdoors over large areas. The results demonstrate both the long term stability and the overall accuracy of our algorithm as intended to provide a solution to the camera tracking problem in augmented reality applications.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["SRI International", "SRI International", "SRI International", "SRI International", "SRI International"], "authors": ["Taragay Oskiper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oskiper:Taragay", "Han-Pang Chiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiu:Han=Pang", "Zhiwei Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Zhiwei", "Supun Samarasekera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samarasekera:Supun", "Rakesh Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Rakesh"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2011", "pages": 8}
