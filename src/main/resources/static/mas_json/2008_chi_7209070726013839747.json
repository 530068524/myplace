Eighteen participants used a mouse in performing a total of 5,400 target selection trials. Comparing nominal, speed-emphasis, and accuracy-emphasis conditions, significant main effects were found on movement time (ms) and error rate (%), but not on throughput (bits/s). In the latter case, failure to reject the null hypothesis of \"no significant difference\" (i.e., .05", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["York University", "University of Tampere"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["I.
