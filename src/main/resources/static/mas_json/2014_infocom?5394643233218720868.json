Weformulate the problem of allocating contents to the dedicatedstorage as a finite horizon dynamic decision problem, and showthat a discrete time decision problem is a good approximation forpiecewise stationary workloads. We provide an exact solution tothe discrete time decision problem in the form of a mixed integerlinear programming problem, propose computationally feasibleapproximations, and give bounds on their approximation ratios.Finally, we evaluate the algorithms using synthetic and measuredtraces from a commercial music on-demand service and giveinsight into their performance as a function of the workload characteristics.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Link\u00f6ping University", "Sch. of Electr. ... ockholm, Sweden"], "authors": ["Gy\u00f6rgy D\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=aacute=n:Gy=ouml=rgy", "Niklas Carlsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carlsson:Niklas"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
