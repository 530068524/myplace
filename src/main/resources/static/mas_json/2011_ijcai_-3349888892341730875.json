In this work we show that a special case of the problem, that is of great interest to our partners in industry, can directly be tackled via a structural problem decompostion method. Combining these theoretical insights with general purpose AI techniques such as constraint satisfaction and SAT solving proves to be particularly effective in practice.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Markus Aschinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aschinger:Markus", "Conrad Drescher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drescher:Conrad", "Georg Gottlob.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottlob:Georg", "Peter Jeavons.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeavons:Peter", "Evgenij Thorstensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thorstensen:Evgenij"], "pages": 7}
