Most existing methods utilize label information to reduce the semantic gap between different modalities. However, it is usually time-consuming to manually label large-scale data. This paper proposes a Self-Paced Cross-Modal Subspace Matching (SCSM) method for unsupervised multimodal data. We assume that multimodal data are pair-wised and from several semantic groups, which form hard pair-wised constraints and soft semantic group constraints respectively. Then, we formulate the unsupervised cross-modal matching problem as a non-convex joint feature learning and data grouping problem. Self-paced learning, which learns samples from 'easy' to 'complex', is further introduced to refine the grouping result. Moreover, a multimodal graph is constructed to preserve the relationship of both inter- and intra-modality similarity. An alternating minimization method is employed to minimize the non-convex optimization problem, followed by the discussion on its convergence analysis and computational complexity. Experimental results on four multimodal databases show that SCSM outperforms state-of-the-art cross-modal subspace learning methods.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jian Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Jian", "Zhihang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhihang", "Dong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Dong", "Ran He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Ran", "Jingdong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingdong"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
