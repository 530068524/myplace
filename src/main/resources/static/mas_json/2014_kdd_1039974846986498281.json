Existing methods for clustering uncertain data compute a single clustering without any indication of its quality and reliability; thus, decisions based on their results are questionable. In this paper, we describe a framework, based on possible-worlds semantics; when applied on an uncertain dataset, it computes a set of representative clusterings, each of which has a probabilistic guarantee not to exceed some maximum distance to the ground truth clustering, i.e., the clustering of the actual (but unknown) data. Our framework can be combined with any existing clustering algorithm and it is the first to provide quality guarantees about its result. In addition, our experimental evaluation shows that our representative clusterings have a much smaller deviation from the ground truth clustering than existing approaches, thus reducing the effect of uncertainty.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "University of Hong Kong", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "authors": ["Andreas Z\u00fcfle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Z=uuml=fle:Andreas", "Tobias Emrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emrich:Tobias", "Klaus Arthur Schmid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmid:Klaus_Arthur", "Nikos Mamoulis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mamoulis:Nikos", "Arthur Zimek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimek:Arthur", "Matthias Renz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Renz:Matthias"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
