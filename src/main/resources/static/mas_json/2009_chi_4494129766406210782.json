In this paper, we present in-depth results from an in situ, longitudinal study of an activity-based computing system, Giornata. We detail the ways that the specific features of this system influenced the everyday work experiences of a small cohort of knowledge workers. Our analysis provides contributions at several levels of granularity-we provide concrete design recommendations based on participants' reactions to the particular features of the Giornata system and a discussion about how our findings can provide insight about the broader understanding of knowledge work and activity within HCI.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Stephen Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Stephen", "Elizabeth D.
