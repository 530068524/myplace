However, extending an IDE is still a possibility restricted to developers with deep knowledge about the specific development environment and its architecture. In this paper we present MASH, a tool that eases the programming of Integrated Development Environments. The tool supports the definition of workflows that can be quickly designed to integrate functionalities offered by multiple plug-ins, without the need of knowing anything about the internal architecture of the IDE. Workflows can be easily reshaped every time an analysis must be modified, without the need of producing Java code and deploying components in the IDE. Early results suggest that this approach can effectively facilitate programming of IDEs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Milano-Bicocca"], "authors": ["Leonardo Mariani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mariani:Leonardo", "Fabrizio Pastore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pastore:Fabrizio"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
