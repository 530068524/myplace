Its applicability to large datasets has been addressed with online and randomized methods, that reduce the complexity in one of the matrix dimension, but not in both of them. In this paper, we tackle very large matrices in both dimensions. We propose a new factorization method that scales gracefully to terabyte-scale datasets. Those could not be processed by previous algorithms in a reasonable amount of time. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on massive functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, and on matrix completion problems for recommender systems, where we obtain significant speed-ups compared to state-of-the art coordinate descent methods.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Arthur Mensch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mensch:Arthur", "Julien Mairal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mairal:Julien", "Bertrand Thirion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thirion:Bertrand", "Ga\u00ebl Varoquaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varoquaux:Ga=euml=l"], "pages": 10}
