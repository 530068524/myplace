One hundred eighty-eight students from four social work programs rated their skills and satisfaction and answered questions about frequency of practicing professional skills in field practicum. In addition, we had performance evaluations by their field instructors for 120 students. More frequent practice of nearly all 38 skills was associated with greater satisfaction with field education and greater self-evaluation of performance. Frequency of practicing about one-third of the skills was also associated with field instructors' evaluations of students. The results support the usefulness of repeatedly practicing skills in field education.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University at Albany, SUNY", "University at Albany, SUNY", "University of Texas\u2013Pan American", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Texas A&M University", "Baylor University", "Open University in the Netherlands", "East China Normal University", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "Boston University", "Institute of Cl ... ersity Hospital", "Institute of Cl ... ersity Hospital"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Elie Cattan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cattan:Elie", "Am\u00e9lie Rochet-Capellan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rochet=Capellan:Am=eacute=lie", "Pascal Perrier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perrier:Pascal", "Fran\u00e7ois B\u00e9rard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=eacute=rard:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 11}
