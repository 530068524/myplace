The parameterised parity game \u00e2   with  n  nodes and  m  distinct values (aka colours or priorities) \u00e2   is proven to be in the class of fixed parameter tractable ( FPT ) problems when parameterised over  m . Both results improve known bounds, from runtime  n   O (\u00e2   n )  to  O ( n  log( m )+6 ) and from an  XP -algorithm with runtime  O ( n  I ( m ) ) for fixed parameter  m  to an  FPT -algorithm with runtime  O ( n  5 )+ g ( m ), for some function  g  depending on  m  only. As an application it is proven that coloured Muller games with  n  nodes and  m  colours can be decided in time  O (( m   m   \ufffd\u00b7  n ) 5 ); it is also shown that this bound cannot be improved to  O ((2  m   \ufffd\u00b7  n )  c  ), for any  c , unless  FPT  =  W[1] .", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Auckland", "National University of Singapore", "University of Auckland", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Cristian S.
