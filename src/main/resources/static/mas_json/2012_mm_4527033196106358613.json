This part of MPEG-V standardizes the description of sensory effects (e.g., light, wind) in order to be rendered on sensory devices (e.g., fans, vibration chairs) aiming at generating a sensory experience stimulating possibly all human senses. Our implementation comprises a toolset to author sensory effects associated with multimedia content and the simulation thereof. Furthermore, it includes a library, a standalone player, and a Web browser plug-in which enables the playback and rendering of sensory effects on off-the-shelf rendering devices and in various contexts.
