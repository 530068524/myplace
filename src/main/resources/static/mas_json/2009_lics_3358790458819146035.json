Locally finite Kripke polynomial coalgebras can be characterized up to bisimulation by a specification language that generalizes Kleene\u2019s regular expressions for finite automata. In this paper, we equip this specification language with an axiomatization and prove it sound and complete with respect to bisimulation, using a purely coalgebraic argument. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework by providing a finite equational system for (non-)deterministic finite automata, la-belled transition systems with explicit termination, and automata on guarded strings.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Leiden University", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Theoretical Computer Science"], "authors": ["Marcello M.
