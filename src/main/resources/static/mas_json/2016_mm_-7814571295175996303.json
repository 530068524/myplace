{"title": "OpenVQ: A Video Quality Assessment Toolkit.", "fields": ["subjective video quality", "toolbox", "video quality", "spite", "structural similarity"], "abstract": "This paper presents an open source video quality assessment tool called OpenVQ and OPVQ, an objective quality metric based on work of the Video Quality Experts Group. It was primarily developed to satisfy the need of the community for a freely accessible and easy-to-use quality assessment tool, which would remove the need for using throughly outdated methods that is still prevalent because only those are easily available. OpenVQ is implemented as a toolbox of full-reference quality assessment methods, which can be extended with improved methods in the future. The primary method provided by OpenVQ at this time is OPVQ, the Open Perceptual Video Quality metric. It is very much inspired by the formal model of ITU-T Rec. J.247 Annex B, however with many modifications to deal with errors and inconsistencies in formulas and pseudo code, and restrictions to avoid violating known patents. OPVQ has been validated with several IRRCyN datasets and was found to yield results similar to those reported in ITU.T J.247. OpenVQ implements also PSNR (Peak signal-to-noise-ratio), because it is in high demand in spite of its bad performance, and SSIM (Structural similarity index), an image quality metric that is known to perform quite well in many cases.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Steria", "University of Oslo", "University of Oslo", "University of Oslo", "LABO Mixed Real ... s, Oslo, Norway"], "authors": ["Kristian Skarseth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skarseth:Kristian", "Henrik Bj\u00f8rlo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bj=oslash=rlo:Henrik", "P\u00e5l Halvorsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halvorsen:P=aring=l", "Michael Riegler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riegler:Michael", "Carsten Griwodz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Griwodz:Carsten"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
