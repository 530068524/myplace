{"title": "Building sensitising terms to understand free-play in open-ended interactive art environments.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "common ground", "multimedia", "situated", "interactive art", "first impression"], "abstract": "In this paper we introduce and discuss the nature of free-play in the context of three open-ended interactive art installation works. We observe the interaction work of situated free-play of the participants in these environments and, building on precedent work, devise a set of sensitising terms derived both from the literature and from what we observe from participants interacting there. These sensitising terms act as guides and are designed to be used by those who experience, evaluate or report on open-ended interactive art. That is, we propose these terms as a common-ground language to be used by participants communicating while in the art work to describe their experience, by researchers in the various stages of research process (observation, coding activity, analysis, reporting, and publication), and by inter-disciplinary researchers working across the fields of HCI and art. This work builds a foundation for understanding the relationship between free-play, open-ended environments, and interactive installations and contributes sensitising terms useful for the HCI community for discussion and analysis of open-ended interactive art works.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ann Judith Morrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morrison:Ann_Judith", "Stephen Viller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viller:Stephen", "Peta Mitchell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitchell:Peta"], "pages": 10}
