In particular, Fischlin and Schroder recently ruled out a large class of three-move blind signatures in the standard model (Eurocrypt'10). In particular, their result shows that finding security proofs for the well-known blind signature schemes by Chaum, and by Pointcheval and Stern in the standard model via black-box reductions is hard. In this work we propose the first roundoptimal, i.e., two-move, blind signature scheme in the standard model (i.e., without assuming random oracles or the existence of a common reference string). Our scheme relies on the Decisional Diffie Hellman assumption and the existence of sub-exponentially hard 1-to-1 one way functions. This scheme is also secure in the concurrent setting.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Tartu"], "authors": ["Sanjam Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Sanjam", "Vanishree Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Vanishree", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit", "Dominique Schr\u00f6der.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schr=ouml=der:Dominique", "Dominique Unruh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unruh:Dominique"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2011", "pages": 19}
