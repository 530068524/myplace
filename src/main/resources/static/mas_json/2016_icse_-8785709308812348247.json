{"title": "Are \"non-functional\" requirements really non-functional?: an investigation of non-functional requirements in practice.", "fields": ["non functional requirement", "functional specification", "non functional testing", "requirements elicitation", "requirements management"], "abstract": "Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are commonly distinguished from functional requirements by differentiating  how  the system shall do something in contrast to  what  the system shall do. This distinction is not only prevalent in research, but also influences how requirements are handled in practice. NFRs are usually documented separately from functional requirements, without quantitative measures, and with relatively vague descriptions. As a result, they remain difficult to analyze and test. Several authors argue, however, that many so-called NFRs actually describe behavioral properties and may be treated the same way as functional requirements. In this paper, we empirically investigate this point of view and aim to increase our understanding on the nature of NFRs addressing system properties. We report on the classification of 530 NFRs extracted from 11 industrial requirements specifications and analyze to which extent these NFRs describe system behavior. Our results suggest that most \"non-functional\" requirements are  not  non-functional as they describe behavior of a system. Consequently, we argue that many so-called NFRs can be handled similarly to functional requirements.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Jonas Eckhardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eckhardt:Jonas", "Andreas Vogelsang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogelsang:Andreas", "Daniel M\u00e9ndez Fern\u00e1ndez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern=aacute=ndez:Daniel_M=eacute=ndez"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
