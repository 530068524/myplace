These changes may lead to design erosion and the introduction of inadequate design solutions, such as design antipatterns. Several empirical studies provide evidence that the presence of antipatterns is generally associated with lower productivity, greater rework, and more significant design efforts for developers. In order to improve the quality and remove antipatterns, refactoring operations are needed. In this demo, we present the Extract class features of ARIES (Automated Refactoring In EclipSe), an Eclipse plug-in that supports the software engineer in removing the \u201cBlob\u201d antipattern.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Salerno", "University of Salerno", "Wayne State University", "University of Molise", "University of Molise"], "authors": ["Gabriele Bavota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bavota:Gabriele", "Andrea De Lucia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucia:Andrea_De", "Andrian Marcus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marcus:Andrian", "Rocco Oliveto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveto:Rocco", "Fabio Palomba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palomba:Fabio"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
