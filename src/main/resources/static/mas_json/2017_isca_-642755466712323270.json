DVMT decouples the virtual-to-physical mapping process from the access permissions, giving applications freedom in choosing mapping schemes, while maintaining security within the operating system. Furthermore, DVMT is designed to support virtualized environments, as a means to collapse the costly, hardware-assisted two-dimensional translations. We describe the architecture in detail and demonstrate its effectiveness by evaluating several different DVMT schemes on a range of virtualized applications with a model based on measurements from a commercial system. We show that different DVMT configurations preserve the native performance, while achieving speedups of 1.2x to 2.0x in virtualized environments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Hanna Alam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alam:Hanna", "Tianhao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tianhao", "Mattan Erez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erez:Mattan", "Yoav Etsion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etsion:Yoav"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
