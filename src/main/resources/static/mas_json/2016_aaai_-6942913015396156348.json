{"title": "SDDs Are Exponentially More Succinct than OBDDs.", "fields": ["knowledge compilation", "open problem", "binary decision diagram", "exponential growth", "exponential function"], "abstract": "Introduced by Darwiche (2011), sentential decision diagrams (SDDs) are essentially as tractable as ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs), but tend to be more succinct in practice. This makes SDDs a prominent representation language, with many applications in artificial intelligence and knowledge compilation.\n\nWe prove that SDDs are more succinct than OBDDs also in theory, by constructing a family of boolean functions where each member has polynomial SDD size but exponential OBDD size. This exponential separation improves a quasipolynomial separation recently established by Razgon (2014a), and settles an open problem in knowledge compilation (Darwiche 2011).", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Simone Bova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bova:Simone"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
