{"title": "Smashing SQUASH-0.", "fields": ["key recovery attack", "mount", "coins", "cryptosystem", "cryptanalysis"], "abstract": "At the RFID Security Workshop 2007, Adi Shamir presented a new challenge-response protocol well suited for RFIDs, although based on the Rabin public-key cryptosystem. This protocol, which we call SQUASH-0, was using a linear mixing function which was subsequently withdrawn. Essentially, we mount an attack against SQUASH-0 with full window which could be used as a \"known random coins attack\" against Rabin-SAEP. We then extend it for SQUASH-0 with arbitrary window. We apply it with the proposed modulus 21 277*** 1 to run a key recovery attack using 1 024 chosen challenges. Since the security arguments equally apply to the final version of SQUASH and to SQUASH-0, we challenge the blame-game argument for the security of SQUASH. Nevertheless, our attacks are inefficient when using non-linear mixing so the security of SQUASH remains open.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Khaled Ouafi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouafi:Khaled", "Serge Vaudenay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaudenay:Serge"], "pages": 13}
