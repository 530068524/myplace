{"title": "Networked Empowerment on Facebook Groups for Parents of Children with Special Needs.", "fields": ["politics", "social media", "empowerment", "the internet", "special needs"], "abstract": "Theories of empowerment explain how people gain personal and political control to take action to improve their lives. However, empowerment theories were developed prior to the Internet and fail to account for the speed and scale that people can find one another online. One domain where empowerment is critical is caring for children with special needs, in which parents are required to navigate a complex maze of services and processes to access care for their child. We conducted 43 interviews with parents of children with special needs to investigate whether using social media sites helps them to perform this caregiving work. Critically, parents are able to do this through almost real-time access to other parents on Facebook. This work introduces the concept of networked empowerment, that describes how parents find other parents, access resources, and explore new ways for promoting health advocacy among caregivers at a local and national level. We conclude with design implications for facilitating faster and better access to information and support for caregivers.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tawfiq Ammari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ammari:Tawfiq", "Sarita Yardi Schoenebeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schoenebeck:Sarita_Yardi"], "pages": 10}
