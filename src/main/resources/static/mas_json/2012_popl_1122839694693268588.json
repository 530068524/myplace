By associating fundamental formal models (vector addition systems with recursive transitions) to each fragment, we provide a common platform for exposing the relative difficulties of algorithmic reasoning. For each case we measure the complexity of deciding state-reachability for finite-data recursive programs, and propose algorithms for the decidable cases. The complexities which include PTIME, NP, EXPSPACE, and 2EXPTIME contrast with undecidable state-reachability for recursive multi-threaded programs.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "departments": ["Paris Diderot University", "Paris Diderot University", "Paris Diderot University", "Paris Diderot University"], "authors": ["Ahmed Bouajjani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouajjani:Ahmed", "Michael Emmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emmi:Michael"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
