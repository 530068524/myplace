In a database-first development scenario, the onus is on the developer to construct a meaningful object layer for the application because shipping tools, as ORM tools only ship database reverse-engineering tools that generate objects with a trivial one-to-one mapping. We built a tool, EdmGen++, that combines pattern-finding rules from conceptual modelling literature with configurable conditions that increase the likelihood that found patterns are semantically relevant. EdmGen++ produces a conceptual model with inheritance in Microsoft's Entity Data Model, which Microsoft's Entity Framework uses to support an executable object-to-relational mapping. The execution time of EdmGen++ on customer databases is reasonable for design-time.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Madras", "Microsoft", "Google", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Ankit Malpani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malpani:Ankit", "Philip A.
