In this paper, we are interested in inferring the fluents of vehicles from video. For example, a door (hood, trunk) is open or closed through various actions, light is blinking to turn. Recognizing these fluents has broad applications, yet have received scant attention in the computer vision literature. Car fluent recognition entails a unified framework for car detection, car part localization and part status recognition, which is made difficult by large structural and appearance variations, low resolutions and occlusions. This paper learns a spatial-temporal And-Or hierarchical model to represent car fluent s. The learning of this model is formulated under the latent structural SVM framework. Since there are no publicly related dataset, we collect and annotate a carfluent dataset consisting ofcar videos with diverse fluents. In experiments, the proposed method outperforms several highly related baseline methods in terms of car fluent recognition and car part localization.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Bo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0031:Bo", "Tianfu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Tianfu", "Caiming Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Caiming", "Song-Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song=Chun"], "pages": 10}
