{"title": "New input modalities for modern game design and virtual embodiment.", "fields": ["controller", "headphones", "game design", "input device", "modalities"], "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are not often used as input devices for modern games, due largely to their low bandwidth. However, BCIs can become a useful input modality when adapting the dynamics of the brain-game interaction, as well as combining them with devices based on other physiological signal to make BCIs more powerful and flexible. We introduce the Graz BCI Game Controller (GBGC) and describe how techniques such as context dependence, dwell timers and other intelligent software tools were implemented in a new system to control the Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game World of Warcraft (WoW).", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "authors": ["Reinhold Scherer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scherer:Reinhold", "Markus Pr\u00f6ll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pr=ouml=ll:Markus", "Brendan Z.
