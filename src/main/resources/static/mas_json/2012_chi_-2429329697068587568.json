Standard metrics such as words per minute and keystrokes per character yield information only about the effectiveness of the technology and the interaction techniques developed for eye typing. We conducted an extensive study with almost five hours of eye typing per participant and report on extended qualitative and quantitative analysis of the relationship of dwell time, text entry rate, errors made, and workload experienced by the participants. The analysis method is comprehensive and stresses the need to consider different metrics in unison. The results highlight the importance of catering for individual differences and lead to suggestions for improvements in the interface.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Tampere", "University of Tampere"], "authors": ["Kari-Jouko R\u00e4ih\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=ih=auml=:Kari=Jouko", "Saila Ovaska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ovaska:Saila"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
