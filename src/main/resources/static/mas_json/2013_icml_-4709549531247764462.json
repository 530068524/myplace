Based on a new forecastability measure, ForeCA finds an optimal transformation to separate a multivariate time series into a forecastable and an orthogonal white noise space. I present a converging algorithm with a fast eigenvector solution. Applications to financial and macro-economic time series show that ForeCA can successfully discover informative structure, which can be used for forecasting as well as classification.\n\nThe R package ForeCA accompanies this work and is publicly available on CRAN.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Georg M.
