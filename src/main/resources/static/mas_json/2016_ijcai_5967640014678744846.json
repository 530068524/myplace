We describe a decision procedure to reason about such types. The procedure has been integrated into CVC4, a modern SMT (satisfiability modulo theories) solver, which can be used both as a constraint solver and as an automatic theorem prover. An evaluation based on formalizations developed in the Isabelle proof assistant shows the potential of the procedure.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Iowa", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Andrew Reynolds.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reynolds:Andrew", "Jasmin Christian Blanchette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanchette:Jasmin_Christian"], "pages": 5}
