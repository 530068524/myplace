The main question relevant to the MIQ model is how many queries must we allow to the ideal world adversary? The importance of the above question stems from the fact that if the answer is positive, then it would enable meaningful security guarantees in many application scenarios, as well as, lead to resolution of long standing open questions such as fully concurrent password based key exchange in the plain model.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Boston University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Vipul Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Vipul", "Abhishek Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0002:Abhishek"], "pages": 18}
