{"title": "Scalable consistency in Scatter.", "fields": ["paxos", "trade off", "distributed transaction", "scalability", "distributed data store"], "abstract": "Distributed storage systems often trade off strong semantics for improved scalability. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of Scatter, a scalable and consistent distributed key-value storage system. Scatter adopts the highly decentralized and self-organizing structure of scalable peer-to-peer systems, while preserving linearizable consistency even under adverse circumstances. Our prototype implementation demonstrates that even with very short node lifetimes, it is possible to build a scalable and consistent system with practical performance.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Lisa Glendenning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glendenning:Lisa", "Ivan Beschastnikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beschastnikh:Ivan", "Arvind Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Arvind", "Thomas E.
