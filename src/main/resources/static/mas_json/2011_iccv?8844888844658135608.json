The proposed framework conceptually integrates these two concepts via constructing a graphical model to account for their relationships, and concurrently improves their estimation by iteratively optimizing a novel energy function realizing the model. Specifically, the energy function comprises the objectness, the saliency, and the interaction energy, respectively corresponding to explain their individual regularities and the mutual effects. Minimizing the energy by fixing one or the other would elegantly transform the model into solving the problem of objectness or saliency estimation, while the useful information from the other concept can be utilized through the interaction term. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can simultaneously yield a saliency map of better quality and a more meaningful objectness output for salient object detection.", "citation": "Citations (323)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Kai-Yueh Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kai=Yueh", "Tyng-Luh Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tyng=Luh", "Hwann-Tzong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hwann=Tzong", "Shang-Hong Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Shang=Hong"], "pages": 8}
