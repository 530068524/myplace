{"title": "Intentions in Equilibrium.", "fields": ["mental state", "knowledge management", "teamwork", "computer science", "game theory"], "abstract": "Intentions have been widely studied in AI, both in the context of decision-making within individual agents and in multi-agent systems. Work on intentions in multi-agent systems has focused on joint intention models, which characterise the mental state of agents with a shared goal engaged in teamwork. In the absence of shared goals, however, intentions play another crucial role in multi-agent activity: they provide a basis around which agents can mutually coordinate activities. Models based on shared goals do not attempt to account for or explain this role of intentions. In this paper, we present a formal model of multi-agent systems in which belief-desire-intention agents choose their intentions taking into account the intentions of others. To understand rational mental states in such a setting, we formally define and investigate notions of multi-agent intention equilibrium, which are related to equilibrium concepts in game theory.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Liverpool"], "authors": ["John Grant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grant:John", "Sarit Kraus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraus:Sarit", "Michael Wooldridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wooldridge:Michael"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
