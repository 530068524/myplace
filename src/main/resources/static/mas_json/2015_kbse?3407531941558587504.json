Given a software system with n optional features, measuring all its 2^n possible configurations to determine their performances is usually infeasible. Thus, various techniques have been proposed to predict software performances based on a small sample of measured configurations. We propose a novel algorithm based on Fourier transform that is able to make predictions of any configurable software system with theoretical guarantees of accuracy and confidence level specified by the user, while using minimum number of samples up to a constant factor. Empirical results on the case studies constructed from real-world configurable systems demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Yi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yi", "Jianmei Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jianmei", "Eric Blais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blais:Eric", "Krzysztof Czarnecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czarnecki:Krzysztof"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
