{"title": "Authoring personal histories: exploring the timeline as a framework for meaning making.", "fields": ["timeline", "craft", "salient", "meaning making", "storytelling"], "abstract": "It has been argued that technologies for 'memory' should be designed to support creativity and meaning building, rather than the passive capture of cues for remembering [25]. We report findings from a study inspired by this insight, in which older people made personal digital timelines using a new tool called Project Greenwich. We explore how the constraints of the timeline metaphor offer a framework for authoring, and examine how timelines can be used to underpin meaning building in relation to personal content. We highlight the importance of making, this being a vehicle for connecting with others in the present, and a potential means of emphasizing those elements of the past felt to be most salient when looking back.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Elizabeth Thiry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thiry:Elizabeth", "Si\u00e2n E.
