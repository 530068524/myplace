{"title": "Psychologically Based Virtual-Suspect for Interrogative Interview Training.", "fields": ["interrogation", "respondent", "machine learning", "interrogative", "suspect", "natural language processing", "artificial intelligence", "personality"], "abstract": "This paper presents a Virtual-Suspect system designed for use in police interrogation training simulations. The system allows users to preconfigure various scenarios based on real cases, as well as different suspect histories and personality types. The responses given by the Virtual-Suspect during the interrogation are selected based on context and the suspect\u2019s psychological state, which changes in response to each interrogator\u2019s statement. Experiments with 24 subjects have shown that the Virtual-Suspect\u2019s responses in an interrogation scenario are similar to those of a human respondent.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Israeli Police Department"], "authors": ["Moshe Bitan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bitan:Moshe", "Galit Nahari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nahari:Galit", "Zvi Nisin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nisin:Zvi", "Ariel Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Ariel", "Sarit Kraus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraus:Sarit"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
