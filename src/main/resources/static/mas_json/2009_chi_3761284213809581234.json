Several cursors are displayed on the screen with one of them selected as the active cursor. Eye tracking is used to choose the active cursor. An experiment with 13 participants showed that multiple cursors speed up the selection over long distances, but not over short distances. Participants felt the technique was fastest with 4 cursors per monitor, but still preferred to have only 1 cursor per monitor for their own use.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Tampere", "University of Tampere"], "authors": ["Kari-Jouko R\u00e4ih\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=ih=auml=:Kari=Jouko", "Oleg Spakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spakov:Oleg"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
