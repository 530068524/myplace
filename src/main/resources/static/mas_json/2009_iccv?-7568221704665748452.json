Given point sets from two views of a stationary scene, our algorithm registers the point sets while retaining internal scene structure. It simultaneously ensures that the resultant registration is consistent with that of a moving camera viewing a static scene (adheres to some epipolar constraint). Our statistical formulation can incorporate but does not necessarily require additional constraints such as brightness constancy and high dimensional point descriptors such as SIFT. We show that our algorithm is stable over a variety of scenes and offers a pose from edge system which handles currently difficult structure from motion scenes more robustly.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Defense Science ... tion, Singapore", "Defense Science ... tion, Singapore"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Wen-Yan Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Wen=Yan", "Guo Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Guo", "Ping Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Ping", "Loong Fah Cheong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheong:Loong_Fah", "Chye Hwang Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Chye_Hwang"], "pages": 8}
