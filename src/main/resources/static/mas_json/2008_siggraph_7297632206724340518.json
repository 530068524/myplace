There are two kinds of haptic styli termed wUbi-Pen. The type I has functions of providing vibration, impact, texture and sound and it is a stand alone system including own battery and wireless communication module. The type II does not include the texture display module and it is a miniaturized version. We present a new interaction scheme on the Windows graphical user interface based on pointer movement haptic feedback events such as clicking, drag, drop, moving and etc. In addition, a simple interactive digital sketchbook has been implemented, which is providing haptic and auditory feedback while drawing and touching objects. We also introduce a tactile image display method on a touch screen with the wUbi-Pen and a simple fitting puzzle utilizing haptic feedback events.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute", "Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"], "authors": ["Ki-Uk Kyung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kyung:Ki=Uk", "Jun-Young Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Jun=Young"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2008", "pages": 1}
