Rubato DB employs the staged grid architecture with a novel formula based protocol for distributed concurrency control. Our demonstration will present Rubato DB as one NewSQL database management system running on a collection of commodity servers against two of benchmark sets.   The demo attendees can modify the configuration of system size, fine-tune the query workload, and visualize the performance on the fly by the graphical user interface. Attendees can experiment with various system scales, and thus grasp the potential scalability of Rubato DB, whose performance, with the increase of the number of servers used, can achieve a linear growth for both OLTP application with the strong consistency properties and key-value storage applications with the weak consistency properties.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "Computing Scien ... ton, AB, Canada", "Shanghai Shifan ...
