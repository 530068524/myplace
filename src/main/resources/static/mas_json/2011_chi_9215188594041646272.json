{"title": "Designing from within: humanaquarium.", "fields": ["interaction design", "human computer interaction", "computer science"], "abstract": "We present an experience-based approach to designing a collaborative interactive performance, humanaquarium. Our research explores public interaction with digital technology through the practice-based inquiry of an inter-disciplinary team of interaction designers and musicians. We present a method of designing experience from within, literally situating ourselves within the performance/use space and assuming the roles both of performers and of designers as we develop and refine the humanaquarium project over the course of a year's worth of public performances.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Robyn Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Robyn", "Guy Schofield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schofield:Guy", "John Shearer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shearer:John", "Jayne Wallace.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wallace:Jayne", "Peter C.
