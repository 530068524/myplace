The ligands differ in the substituents at the phenyl ring to probe their influence on the redox behavior, biological activity, and magnetochemistry of the complexes, for which the results are presented and discussed. All synthesized ligands and vanadium(IV) complexes have been characterized by various physicochemical techniques, namely, elemental analysis, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, spectroscopic methods (UV/vis and IR), and cyclic voltammetry. X-ray crystallography of 1 and 3 revealed the presence of a twisted arrangement of the edged-shared bridging core unit. In agreement with the distorted nature of the twisted core, antiferromagnetic exchange interactions were observed between the vanadium(IV) ...", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "University of Jena", "Maharaja Engineering College", "University of Jena", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "University of Granada", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Stanford University", "University of Tokyo", "University of Warsaw"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["David Kohel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohel:David"], "pages": 20}
