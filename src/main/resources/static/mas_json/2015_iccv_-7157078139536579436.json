{"title": "DeepBox: Learning Objectness with Convolutional Networks.", "fields": ["ranking", "machine learning", "convolutional neural network", "architecture", "recall"], "abstract": "Existing object proposal approaches use primarily bottom-up cues to rank proposals, while we believe that \"objectness\" is in fact a high level construct. We argue for a data-driven, semantic approach for ranking object proposals. Our framework, which we call DeepBox, uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to rerank proposals from a bottom-up method. We use a novel four-layer CNN architecture that is as good as much larger networks on the task of evaluating objectness while being much faster. We show that DeepBox significantly improves over the bottom-up ranking, achieving the same recall with 500 proposals as achieved by bottom-up methods with 2000. This improvement generalizes to categories the CNN has never seen before and leads to a 4.5-point gain in detection mAP. Our implementation achieves this performance while running at 260 ms per image.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Weicheng Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Weicheng", "Bharath Hariharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hariharan:Bharath", "Jitendra Malik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malik:Jitendra"], "pages": 9}
