Recent progress on communication tracing opens up novel opportunities for communication modeling due to its lossless yet scalable trace collection. Estimating the impact of scaling on communication efficiency still remains non-trivial due to execution-time variations and exposure to hardware and software artifacts. This work contributes a fundamentally novel modeling scheme. We synthetically generate the application trace for large numbers of nodes by extrapolation from a set of smaller traces. We devise an innovative approach for topology extrapolation of single program, multiple data (SPMD) codes with stencil or mesh communication. The extrapolated trace can subsequently be (a) replayed to assess communication requirements before porting an application, (b) transformed to auto-generate communication benchmarks for various target platforms, and (c) analyzed to detect communication inefficiencies and scalability limitations. To the best of our knowledge, rapidly obtaining the communication behavior of parallel applications at arbitrary scale with the availability of timed replay, yet without actual execution of the application at this scale is without precedence and has the potential to enable otherwise infeasible system simulation at the exascale level.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Xing Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xing", "Frank Mueller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mueller:Frank"], "pages": 10}
