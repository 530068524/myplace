{"title": "Maxing and Ranking with Few Assumptions.", "fields": ["transitive relation", "binary logarithm", "quadratic growth", "pairwise comparison", "ranking"], "abstract": "PAC maximum selection (maxing) and ranking of $n$ elements via random pairwise comparisons have diverse applications and have been studied under many models and assumptions. With just one simple natural assumption: strong stochastic transitivity, we show that maxing can be performed with linearly many comparisons yet ranking requires quadratically many. With no assumptions at all, we show that for the Borda-score metric, maximum selection can be performed with linearly many comparisons and ranking can be performed with $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$ comparisons.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Moein Falahatgar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Falahatgar:Moein", "Yi Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Yi", "Alon Orlitsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orlitsky:Alon", "Venkatadheeraj Pichapati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pichapati:Venkatadheeraj", "Vaishakh Ravindrakumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravindrakumar:Vaishakh"], "pages": 11}
