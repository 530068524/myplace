{"title": "A Characterization of n-Player Strongly Monotone Scheduling Mechanisms.", "fields": ["strongly monotone", "monotonic function", "continuous function", "affine transformation", "combinatorial auction"], "abstract": "Our work deals with the important problem of globally characterizing truthful mechanisms where players have multi-parameter, additive valuations, like scheduling unrelated machines or additive combinatorial auctions. Very few mechanisms are known for these settings and the question is: Can we prove that no other truthful mechanisms exist? We characterize truthful mechanisms for n players and 2 tasks or items, as either task-independent, or a player-grouping minimizer, a new class of mechanisms we discover, which generalizes affine minimizers. We assume decisiveness, strong monotonicity and that the truthful payments are continuous functions of players' bids.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Goethe University Frankfurt", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "authors": ["Annam\u00e1ria Kov\u00e1cs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kov=aacute=cs:Annam=aacute=ria", "Angelina Vidali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidali:Angelina"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
