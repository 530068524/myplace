A particularly effective technique to improve XQuery processing performance consists of using materialized views to answer queries. In this work, we consider the problem of choosing the best views to materialize within a given space budget in order to improve the performance of a query workload. The paper is the first to address the view selection problem for queries and views with value joins and multiple return nodes. The challenges we face stem from the expressive power and features of both the query and view languages and from the size of the search space of candidate views to materialize. While the general problem has prohibitive complexity, we propose and study a heuristic algorithm and demonstrate its superior performance compared to the state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud", "Athens University of Economics and Business"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Asterios Katsifodimos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katsifodimos:Asterios", "Ioana Manolescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manolescu:Ioana", "Vasilis Vassalos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vassalos:Vasilis"], "pages": 12}
