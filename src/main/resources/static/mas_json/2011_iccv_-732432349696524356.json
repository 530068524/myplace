Percent tree cover per 500-m MODIS pixel is estimated using a supervised regression tree algorithm. Data derived from the MODIS visible bands contribute the most to discriminating tree cover. The results show that MODIS data yield greater spatial detail in the characterization of tree cover compared to past efforts using AVHRR data. This finer-scale depiction should allow for using successive tree cover maps in change detection studies at the global scale. Initial validation efforts show a reasonable relationship between the MODIS-estimated tree cover and tree cover from validation sites.", "citation": "Citations (941)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Microsoft", "Stanford University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Vienna University of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology", "Kyoto University", "National Agrarian University", "National Agrarian University", "University of Oxford", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Sebastian Nowozin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nowozin:Sebastian", "Carsten Rother.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rother:Carsten", "Shai Bagon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagon:Shai", "Toby Sharp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharp:Toby", "Bangpeng Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Bangpeng", "Pushmeet Kohli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohli:Pushmeet"], "pages": 8}
