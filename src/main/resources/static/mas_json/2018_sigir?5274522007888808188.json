{"title": "Online Job Search: Study of Users' Search Behavior using Search Engine Query Logs.", "fields": ["data mining", "information retrieval", "the internet", "computer science", "search engine"], "abstract": "Over the last few years, an increasing number of user's and enterprises on the internet has generated a global marketplace for both employers and job seekers. Despite the fact that online job search is now more preferable than traditional methods - leading to better matches between the job seekers and the employer's intents - there is still little insight into how online job searches are different from general web searches. In this paper, we explore the different characteristics of online job search and their differences with general searches, by leveraging search engine query logs. Our experimental results show that job searches have specific attributes which can be used by search engines to increase the quality of the search results.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Iran Telecommun ... r, Tehran, Iran", "Iran Telecommun ... r, Tehran, Iran", "Polytechnic Ins ...
