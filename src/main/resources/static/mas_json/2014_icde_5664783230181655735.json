We present the salient results of research in this fresh area, addressing all aspects of the query processing stack. Throughout the discussion we draw analogies to the general code generation techniques used in contemporary compiler technology. At the same time we describe the open research problems of the area.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Stratis D.
