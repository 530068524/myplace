{"title": "Asymptotic Analysis of MAP Estimation via the Replica Method and Compressed Sensing.", "fields": ["replica", "estimator", "maximum a posteriori estimation", "compressed sensing", "lasso"], "abstract": "The replica method is a non-rigorous but widely-accepted technique from statistical physics used in the asymptotic analysis of large, random, nonlinear problems. This paper applies the replica method to non-Gaussian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. It is shown that with random linear measurements and Gaussian noise, the asymptotic behavior of the MAP estimate of an n-dimensional vector \"decouples\" as n scalar MAP estimators. The result is a counterpart to Guo and Verdu's replica analysis of minimum mean-squared error estimation.\n\nThe replica MAP analysis can be readily applied to many estimators used in compressed sensing, including basis pursuit, lasso, linear estimation with thresholding, and zero norm-regularized estimation. In the case of lasso estimation the scalar estimator reduces to a soft-thresholding operator, and for zero norm-regularized estimation it reduces to a hard-threshold. Among other benefits, the replica method provides a computationally-tractable method for exactly computing various performance metrics including mean-squared error and sparsity pattern recovery probability.", "citation": "Citations (194)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Qualcomm", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Sundeep Rangan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangan:Sundeep", "Alyson K.
