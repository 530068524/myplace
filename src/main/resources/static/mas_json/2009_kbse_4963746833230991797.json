{"title": "Cache-Based Model Checking of Networked Applications: From Linear to Branching Time.", "fields": ["cache", "model checking", "thread", "backtracking", "schedule"], "abstract": "Many applications are concurrent and communicate over a network. The non-determinism in the thread and communication schedules makes it desirable to model check such systems. However, a simple state space exploration scheme is not applicable, as backtracking results in repeated communication operations. A cache-based approach solves this problem by hiding redundant communication operations from the environment. In this work, we propose a change from a linear-time to a branching-time cache, allowing us to relax restrictions in previous work regarding communication traces that differ between schedules. We successfully applied the new algorithm to real-life programs where a previous solution is not applicable.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Chiba University"], "authors": ["Cyrille Artho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Artho:Cyrille", "Watcharin Leungwattanakit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leungwattanakit:Watcharin", "Masami Hagiya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hagiya:Masami", "Yoshinori Tanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanabe:Yoshinori", "Mitsuharu Yamamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamamoto:Mitsuharu"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
