{"title": "iProbe: A lightweight user-level dynamic instrumentation tool.", "fields": ["instrumentation", "flags register", "executable", "spec", "tracing"], "abstract": "We introduce a new hybrid instrumentation tool for dynamic application instrumentation called  iProbe , which is flexible and has low overhead. iProbe takes a novel 2-stage design, and offloads much of the dynamic instrumentation complexity to an offline compilation stage. It leverages standard compiler flags to introduce \"place-holders\" for hooks in the program executable. Then it utilizes an efficient user-space \"HotPatching\" mechanism which modifies the functions to be traced and enables execution of instrumented code in a safe and secure manner. In its evaluation on a micro-benchmark and SPEC CPU2006 benchmark applications, the iProbe prototype achieved the instrumentation overhead an order of magnitude lower than existing state-of-the-art dynamic instrumentation tools like SystemTap and DynInst.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Nipun Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Nipun", "Hui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Hui", "Junghwan Rhee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhee:Junghwan", "Kenji Yoshihira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshihira:Kenji", "Guofei Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Guofei"], "pages": 4}
