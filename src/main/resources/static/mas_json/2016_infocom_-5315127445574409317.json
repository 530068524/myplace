{"title": "Crowdlet: Optimal worker recruitment for self-organized mobile crowdsourcing.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "exploit", "system model", "android", "nice"], "abstract": "In this paper, we advocate Crowdlet, a novel self-organized mobile crowdsourcing paradigm, in which a mobile task requester can proactively exploit a massive crowd of encountered mobile workers at real-time for quick and high-quality results. We present a comprehensive system model of Crowdlet that defines task, worker arrival and worker ability models. Further, we introduce a service quality concept to indicate the expected service gain that a requester can enjoy when he recruits an encountered worker, by jointly taking into account worker ability, real-timeness and task reward. Based on the models, we formulate an online worker recruitment problem to maximize the expected sum of service quality. We derive an optimal worker recruitment policy through the dynamic programming principle, and show that it exhibits a nice threshold based structure. We conduct extensive performance evaluation based on real traces, and numerical results demonstrate that our policy can achieve superior performance and improve more than 30% performance gain over classic policies. Besides, our Android prototype shows that Crowdlet is cost-efficient, requiring less than 7 seconds and 6 Joule in terms of time and energy cost for policy computation in most cases.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Nankai University", "University of G\u00f6ttingen", "Nankai University", "University of G\u00f6ttingen"], "authors": ["Lingjun Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Lingjun", "Xu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xu", "Jingdong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jingdong", "Xiaoming Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu_0001:Xiaoming"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
