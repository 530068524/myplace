{"title": "Targeted Threat Index: Characterizing and Quantifying Politically-Motivated Targeted Malware.", "fields": ["civil society", "sophistication", "compromise", "social engineering", "targeted threat"], "abstract": "Targeted attacks on civil society and nongovernmental organizations have gone underreported despite the fact that these organizations have been shown to be frequent targets of these attacks. In this paper, we shed light on targeted malware attacks faced by these organizations by studying malicious e-mails received by 10 civil society organizations (the majority of which are from groups related to China and Tibet issues) over a period of 4 years.\n\nOur study highlights important properties of malware threats faced by these organizations with implications on how these organizations defend themselves and how we quantify these threats. We find that the technical sophistication of malware we observe is fairly low, with more effort placed on socially engineering the e-mail content. Based on this observation, we develop the Targeted Threat Index (TTI), a metric which incorporates both social engineering and technical sophistication when assessing the risk of malware threats. We demonstrate that this metric is more effective than simple technical sophistication for identifying malware threats with the highest potential to successfully compromise victims. We also discuss how education efforts focused on changing user behaviour can help prevent compromise. For two of the three Tibetan groups in our study simple steps such as avoiding the use of email attachments could cut document-based malware threats delivered through e-mail that we observed by up to 95%.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Seth Hardy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardy:Seth", "Masashi Crete-Nishihata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crete=Nishihata:Masashi", "Katharine Kleemola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleemola:Katharine", "Adam Senft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Senft:Adam", "Byron Sonne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sonne:Byron", "Greg Wiseman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiseman:Greg", "Phillipa Gill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gill:Phillipa", "Ronald J.
