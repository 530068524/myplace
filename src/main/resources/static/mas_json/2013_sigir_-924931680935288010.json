We propose a probabilistic field-of-view model which captures the uncertainty in camera sensor data. This model can be used to retrieve a set of candidate images. The visual similarity computation of the candidate images relies on the sparse coding technique. We also propose an ANN filtering technique to speedup the sparse coding. The final ranking combines an uncertain geometric relevance with the visual similarity. Our preliminary experiments conducted in an urban area of a large city show promising results. The most distinguishing feature of our framework is its ability to perform well in contaminated, real-world online image database. Besides, our framework is highly scalable as it does not incur any complex data structure.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Pai Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Pai", "Lidan Shou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shou:Lidan", "Ke Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0005:Ke", "Gang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Gang", "Sai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Sai"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
