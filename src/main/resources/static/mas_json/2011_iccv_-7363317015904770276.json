Unlike traditional multi-view stereo approaches that generally handle a single static scene or an object, we show that depth estimation and segmentation can be jointly modeled and be globally solved in an energy minimization framework for ubiquitous scenes containing multiple independently moving rigid objects. Our major contribution includes a new multi-body stereo model, which integrates the color, geometry, and layer constraints for spatio-temporal depth recovery and automatic object segmentation. A two-pass optimization scheme is proposed to progressively update the estimates. Our method is applied to a variety of challenging examples.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Guofeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Guofeng", "Jiaya Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jiaya", "Hujun Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Hujun"], "pages": 8}
