Unlike most other operations in lattice-based cryptography, however, the known algorithm for this task (due to Gentry, Peikert, and Vaikuntanathan; STOC 2008) is rather inefficient, and is inherently sequential.\n\nWe present a new Gaussian sampling algorithm for lattices that is efficient and highly parallelizable. We also show that in most cryptographic applications, the algorithm's efficiency comes at almost no cost in asymptotic security. At a high level, our algorithm resembles the \"perturbation\" heuristic proposed as part of NTRUSign (Hoffstein et al., CTRSA 2003), though the details are quite different. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm and rigorous analysis demonstrating the security of a perturbation-like technique.", "citation": "Citations (197)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2010", "pages": 18}
