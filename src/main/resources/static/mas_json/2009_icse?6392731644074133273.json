An alternative to drastic change are internal changes that adjust current options within a software project. In this paper, we show that the effects of numerous internal changes can out-weigh the effects of drastic changes. That is, the benefits of drastic change can often be achieved without disrupting a project.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "Oussama El-Rawa ...
