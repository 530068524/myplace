With our optimizations, these contexts are eliminated and merged into hardware interrupts or I/O participating threads without introducing side effects. This was achieved by pipelining fine grained host controller operations with the cooperation of I/O participating threads. To safely expose fine grained host controller operations to upper layers, we present a low level hardware abstraction layer interface. Evaluations with micro-benchmarks showed that our optimizations were capable of accommodating up to five, AHCI controller attached, SATA 3.0 SSD devices at 671k IOPS, while current Linux SCSI based I/O path was limited at 354k IOPS failing to accommodate more than three devices. Evaluation on an SSD backed key value system also showed IOPS improvement using our I/O optimizations.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Woong Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Woong", "Qichen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qichen", "Myoungwon Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Myoungwon", "Hyeonsang Eom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eom:Hyeonsang", "Heon Y.
