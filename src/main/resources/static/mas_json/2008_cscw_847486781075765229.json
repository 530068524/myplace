We contribute to this line of research by analyzing collaboration in 5-person instance runs in World of Warcraft, an aspect of the game that is considered routine and mundane work by players yet remains largely unexamined in current literature. Using a combination of ethnographic observation, interview, chat and video log analysis, we unpack the conditions under which players can produce the most effective outcomes while having fun, and offer a three-level model of successful instance runs.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Shaowen Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Shaowen", "Jeffrey Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Jeffrey", "Tyler Pace.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pace:Tyler", "Kayce N.
