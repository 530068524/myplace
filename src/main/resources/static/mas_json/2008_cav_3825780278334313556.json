As the well-quasi order required for a well-structured transition system we use the graph minor ordering. We give an explicit construction of the backward step and apply our theory in order to show the correctness of a leader election protocol.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Abteilung f\u00fcr I ...
