In applications where there are multiple data delivery tasks with high data rates and time constraints, low-duty-cycle working mode may cause severe transmission congestion and data loss. In order to alleviate congestion and reduce data loss, the tasks need to be carefully scheduled to balance the workloads among the sensor nodes in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This paper studies the load balancing problem, and proves it is NP-Complete in general network graphs. Two efficient scheduling algorithms to achieve load balance are proposed and analyzed. Furthermore, a task scheduling protocol is designed relying on the proposed algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to tackle multiple task scheduling for low-duty-cycled sensor networks. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms greatly improve the network performance in most scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Nanyang Technological University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Shuguang Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Shuguang", "Jianzhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianzhong", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo", "Jiliang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jiliang", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
