{"title": "An efficient reduction from two-source to non-malleable extractors: achieving near-logarithmic min-entropy.", "fields": ["logarithm", "extractor", "binary logarithm", "min entropy", "bipartite graph"], "abstract": "The breakthrough result of Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman (2016) gives a reduction from the construction of explicit two-source extractors to the construction of explicit non-malleable extractors. However, even assuming the existence of optimal explicit non-malleable extractors only gives a two-source extractor (or a Ramsey graph) for  poly (log n ) entropy, rather than the optimal  O (log n ).   In this paper we modify the construction to solve the above barrier. Using the currently best explicit non-malleable extractors we get an explicit bipartite Ramsey graphs for sets of size 2  k  , for  k = O (log n  loglog n ). Any further improvement in the construction of non-malleable extractors would immediately yield a corresponding two-source extractor.   Intuitively, Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman use an extractor as a sampler, and we observe that one could use a weaker object \u00e2   a  somewhere-random condenser  with a small entropy gap and a very short seed. We also show how to explicitly construct this weaker object using the error reduction technique of Raz, Reingold and Vadhan (1999), and the constant-degree dispersers of Zuckerman (2006) that also work against extremely small tests.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Avraham Ben-Aroya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Aroya:Avraham", "Dean Doron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doron:Dean", "Amnon Ta-Shma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Ta=Shma:Amnon"], "pages": 10}
