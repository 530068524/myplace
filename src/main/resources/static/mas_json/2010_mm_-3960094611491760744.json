We therefore revisit  patching , a video-on-demand idea from the 1990s. We have built Pull-Patching, an approach that combines the patching ideas with  adaptive segmented HTTP streaming , a unicast technique that is used by most commercial providers of large-scale, true video-on-demand in the Internet today. The prototype is tested in a combined Internet and lab en- vironment where we show the influence of practical factors like packet loss, delay and limited resource availability, and identify several details that require further study.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Oslo", "University of Oslo", "University of Oslo"], "authors": ["Espen Jacobsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobsen:Espen", "Carsten Griwodz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Griwodz:Carsten", "P\u00e5l Halvorsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halvorsen:P=aring=l"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
