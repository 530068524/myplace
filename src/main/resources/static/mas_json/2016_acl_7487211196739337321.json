{"title": "Neural Semantic Role Labeling with Dependency Path Embeddings.", "fields": ["predicate", "natural language processing", "semantic role labeling", "embedding", "syntax"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel model for semantic role labeling that makes use of neural sequence modeling techniques. Our approach is motivated by the observation that complex syntactic structures and related phenomena, such as nested subordinations and nominal predicates, are not handled well by existing models. Our model treats such instances as subsequences of lexicalized dependency paths and learns suitable embedding representations. We experimentally demonstrate that such embeddings can improve results over previous state-of-the-art semantic role labelers, and showcase qualitative improvements obtained by our method.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["School of Informatics", "School of Informatics"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Michael Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Michael", "Mirella Lapata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lapata:Mirella"], "pages": -1}
