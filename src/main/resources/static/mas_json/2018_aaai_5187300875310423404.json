GVIN emulates the value iteration algorithm by using a novel graph convolution operator, which enables GVIN to learn and plan on irregular spatial graphs. We propose three novel differentiable kernels as graph convolution operators and show that the embedding based kernel achieves the best performance. We further propose episodic Q-learning, an improvement upon traditional n-step Q-learning that stabilizes training for networks that contain a planning module. Lastly, we evaluate GVIN on planning problems in 2D mazes, irregular graphs, and real-world street networks, showing that GVIN generalizes well for both arbitrary graphs and unseen graphs of larger scale and outperforms a naive generalization of VIN (discretizing a spatial graph into a 2D image).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Clemson University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Sufeng Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Sufeng", "Siheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Siheng", "Hanyu Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Hanyu", "Colin Targonski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Targonski:Colin", "Melissa C.
