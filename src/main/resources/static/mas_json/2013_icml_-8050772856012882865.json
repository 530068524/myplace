Our formulation includes as special cases Vector-valued Manifold Regularization and Multi-view Learning, thus provides in particular a unifying framework linking these two important learning approaches. In the case of least square loss function, we provide a closed form solution with an efficient implementation. Numerical experiments on challenging multi-class categorization problems show that our multi-view learning formulation achieves results which are comparable with state of the art and are significantly better than single-view learning.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"], "authors": ["Ha Quang Minh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minh:Ha_Quang", "Loris Bazzani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bazzani:Loris", "Vittorio Murino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murino:Vittorio"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
