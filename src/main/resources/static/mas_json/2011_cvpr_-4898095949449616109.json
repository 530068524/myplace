It entails learning a low dimensional subspace over sample-specific regressors. For a given input, the model predicts a subspace thought to contain the corresponding response. Using this subspace as a prior, the search space is considerably more constrained. An efficient local optimisation strategy is proposed for learning and a practical choice for its initialisation suggested. The utility of PRA is demonstrated on the task of non-rigid face and car alignment using challenging \"in the wild\" datasets, where substantial performance improvements are observed over alignment with a conventional prior.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jason M.
