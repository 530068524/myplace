{"title": "HinDroid: An Intelligent Android Malware Detection System Based on Structured Heterogeneous Information Network.", "fields": ["cryptovirology", "cloud computing security", "malware", "application programming interface", "android"], "abstract": "With explosive growth of Android malware and due to the severity of its damages to smart phone users, the detection of Android malware has become increasingly important in cybersecurity. The increasing sophistication of Android malware calls for new defensive techniques that are capable against novel threats and harder to evade. In this paper, to detect Android malware, instead of using Application Programming Interface (API) calls only, we further analyze the different relationships between them and create higher-level semantics which require more effort for attackers to evade the detection. We represent the Android applications (apps), related APIs, and their rich relationships as a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN). Then we use a meta-path based approach to characterize the semantic relatedness of apps and APIs. We use each meta-path to formulate a similarity measure over Android apps, and aggregate different similarities using multi-kernel learning. Then each meta-path is automatically weighted by the learning algorithm to make predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use structured HIN for Android malware detection. Comprehensive experiments on real sample collections from Comodo Cloud Security Center are conducted to compare various malware detection approaches. Promising experimental results demonstrate that our developed system  HinDroid  outperforms other alternative Android malware detection techniques.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["West Virginia University", "West Virginia University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Comodo Security ... lifton, NJ, USA"], "authors": ["Shifu Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Shifu", "Yanfang Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Yanfang", "Yangqiu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yangqiu", "Melih Abdulhayoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdulhayoglu:Melih"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
