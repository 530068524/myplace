{"title": "The computational geowiki: what, why, and how.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "data mining", "computer science", "web mapping"], "abstract": "Google Maps and its spin-offs are highly successful, but they have a major limitation: users see only  pictures  of geographic data. These data are inaccessible except by limited vendor-defined APIs, and associated user data are weakly linked to them. But some applications require access, specifically  geowikis  and  computational geowikis . We present the design and implementation of a computational geowiki. We also show empirically that both geowiki and computational geowiki features are necessary for a representative domain, bicycling, because (a) cyclists have useful knowledge unavailable except from cyclists and (b) cyclist-oriented automatic route-finding is enhanced by user input. Finally, we derive design implications: for example, user contributions presented within a route description are useful, and wikis should support contribution of opinion as well as fact.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Reid Priedhorsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Priedhorsky:Reid", "Loren G.
