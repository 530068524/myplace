{"title": "Massive graph triangulation.", "fields": ["vertex", "graph power", "competitor analysis", "complement graph", "order of magnitude"], "abstract": "This paper studies I/O-efficient algorithms for settling the classic  triangle listing  problem, whose solution is a basic operator in dealing with many other graph problems. Specifically, given an undirected graph  G , the objective of triangle listing is to find all the cliques involving 3 vertices in  G . The problem has been well studied in internal memory, but remains an urgent difficult challenge when  G  does not fit in memory, rendering any algorithm to entail frequent I/O accesses. Although previous research has attempted to tackle the challenge, the state-of-the-art solutions rely on a set of crippling assumptions to guarantee good performance. Motivated by this, we develop a new algorithm that is provably I/O and CPU efficient at the same time, without making any assumption on the input  G  at all. The algorithm uses ideas drastically different from all the previous approaches, and outperformed the existing competitors by a factor over an order of magnitude in our extensive experimentation.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "KAIST"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xiaocheng Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Xiaocheng", "Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei", "Chin-Wan Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Chin=Wan"], "pages": 12}
