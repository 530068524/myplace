Conversely, evolutionary and developmental methods focusing on exploration like novelty search, quality-diversity or goal exploration processes are less sample efficient during exploitation. In this paper, we present the GEP-PG approach, taking the best of both worlds by sequentially combining two variants of a goal exploration process and two variants of DDPG. We study the learning performance of these components and their combination on a low dimensional deceptive reward problem and on the larger Half-Cheetah benchmark. Among other things, we show that DDPG fails on the former and that GEP-PG obtains performance above the state-of-the-art on the latter.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Superior National School of Advanced Techniques", "Superior National School of Advanced Techniques"], "authors": ["C\u00e9dric Colas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colas:C=eacute=dric", "Olivier Sigaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sigaud:Olivier", "Pierre-Yves Oudeyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oudeyer:Pierre=Yves"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
