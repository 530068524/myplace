{"title": "Context-Sensitive Dynamic Partial Order Reduction.", "fields": ["computer science", "theoretical computer science", "swap", "partial order reduction"], "abstract": "Dynamic Partial Order Reduction (DPOR) is a powerful technique used in verification and testing to reduce the number of equivalent executions explored. Two executions are equivalent if they can be obtained from each other by swapping adjacent, non-conflicting (independent) execution steps. Existing DPOR algorithms rely on a notion of independence that is context-insensitive, i.e., the execution steps must be independent in all contexts. In practice, independence is often proved by just checking no execution step writes on a shared variable. We present context-sensitive DPOR, an extension of DPOR that uses context-sensitive independence, where two steps might be independent only in the particular context explored. We show theoretically and experimentally how context-sensitive DPOR can achieve exponential gains.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Complutense University of Madrid", "Complutense University of Madrid", "IMDEA", "University of Melbourne", "Complutense University of Madrid", "Monash University", "IMDEA"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Elvira Albert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albert:Elvira", "Puri Arenas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arenas:Puri", "Maria Garcia de la Banda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banda:Maria_Garcia_de_la", "Miguel G\u00f3mez-Zamalloa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=oacute=mez=Zamalloa:Miguel", "Peter J.
