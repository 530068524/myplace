{"title": "Scheduling Arbitrary-Deadline Sporadic Task Systems on Multiprocessors.", "fields": ["scheduling", "metrical task system", "real time computing", "multiprocessing", "algorithm design"], "abstract": "A new algorithm is proposed for scheduling preemptible arbitrary-deadline sporadic task systems upon multiprocessor platforms, with interprocessor migration permitted. This algorithm is based on a task-splitting approach - while most tasks are entirely assigned to specific processors, a few tasks (fewer than the number of processors) may be split across two processors. This algorithm can be used for two distinct purposes: for actually scheduling specific sporadic task systems, and for feasibility analysis. Simulation- based evaluation indicates that this algorithm offers a significant improvement on the ability to schedule arbitrary- deadline sporadic task systems as compared to the contemporary state-of-art. With regard to feasibility analysis, the new algorithm is proved to offer superior performance guarantees in comparison to prior feasibility tests.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Res.
