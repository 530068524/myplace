Our model, the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader, integrates a multi-hop architecture with a novel attention mechanism, which is based on multiplicative interactions between the query embedding and the intermediate states of a recurrent neural network document reader. This enables the reader to build query-specific representations of tokens in the document for accurate answer selection. The GA Reader obtains state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks for this task--the CNN \\& Daily Mail news stories and the Who Did What dataset. The effectiveness of multiplicative interaction is demonstrated by an ablation study, and by comparing to alternative compositional operators for implementing the gated-attention.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Bhuwan Dhingra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhingra:Bhuwan", "Hanxiao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hanxiao", "Zhilin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhilin", "William W.
