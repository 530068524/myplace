This problem is difficult because the camera is not directly facing the display, but instead captures the eyes of a person in front of the display. Reconstruction of eyes and display is useful for point-of-gaze estimation, which can be approximated from the 3D positions of the iris and display. It is shown that iris boundaries (limbus) and display reflections in a single intrinsically calibrated image provide enough information for such an estimation. The proposed method assumes a simplified geometric eyeball model with certain anatomical constants which are used to reconstruct the eye. A noise performance analysis shows the sensitivity of the proposed method to imperfect data. Experiments on various subjects show that it is possible to determine the approximate area of gaze on a display from a single image.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dirk Schnieders.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schnieders:Dirk", "Xingdou Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Xingdou", "Kwan-Yee Kenneth Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Kwan=Yee_Kenneth"], "pages": 8}
