We give the first polynomial-time deterministic identity testing algorithm for such circuits. Our results also hold in the black-box setting.   The running time of our algorithm is (ns) O(k 3 ) , where n is the number of variables, s is the size of the circuit and k is the fan-in of the top gate. The importance of this model arises from [3], where it was shown that derandomizing black-box polynomial identity testing for general depth-4 circuits implies a derandomization of polynomial identity testing (PIT) for general arithmetic circuits. Prior to our work, the best PIT algorithm for multilinear \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3\u03a0(k) circuits [13] ran in quasi-polynomial-time, with the running time being n O(k 6  log(k) log 2  s ) .   We obtain our results by showing a strong  structural result  for multilinear \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3\u03a0(k) circuits that compute the zero polynomial. We show that under some mild technical conditions, any gate of such a circuit must compute a  sparse  polynomial. We then show how to combine the structure theorem with a result by Klivans and Spielman [17], on the identity testing for sparse polynomials, to yield the full result.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Rutgers University", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shubhangi Saraf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saraf:Shubhangi", "Ilya Volkovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Volkovich:Ilya"], "pages": 10}
