{"title": "Semi-Supervised Random Forests.", "fields": ["semi supervised learning", "popularity", "intuition", "boosting", "random forest"], "abstract": "Random Forests (RFs) have become commonplace in many computer vision applications. Their popularity is mainly driven by their high computational efficiency during both training and evaluation while still being able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. This work extends the usage of Random Forests to Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) problems. We show that traditional decision trees are optimizing multi-class margin maximizing loss functions. From this intuition, we develop a novel multi-class margin definition for the unlabeled data, and an iterative deterministic annealing-style training algorithm maximizing both the multi-class margin of labeled and unlabeled samples. In particular, this allows us to use the predicted labels of the unlabeled data as additional optimization variables. Furthermore, we propose a control mechanism based on the out-of-bag error, which prevents the algorithm from degradation if the unlabeled data is not useful for the task. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning performance in typical machine learning problems and constant improvement using unlabeled data for the Caltech-101 object categorization task.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Christian Leistner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leistner:Christian", "Amir Saffari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saffari:Amir", "Jakob Santner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santner:Jakob", "Horst Bischof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischof:Horst"], "pages": 8}
