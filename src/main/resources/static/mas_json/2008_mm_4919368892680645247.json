{"title": "Interactivity and scalability enhancements for quality-adaptive streaming.", "fields": ["interactivity", "distributed collaboration", "network processor", "amateur", "user generated content"], "abstract": "In this paper we describe the design and implementation of our adaptive media streaming system and its support for fully interactive video navigation. The system builds upon and extends previous work on adaptive streaming, to encompass coordinated adaptation of network, processor, and storage resources. The adaptation methods we describe allow our application to provide robust and responsive streaming, that supports a wider set of video navigation modes unseen before in any previous streaming application.   In addition to the technical contributions toward streaming, and to shed light on the motivation for our approach, this paper also outlines a prototype application we are building above our adaptive-streaming framework for distributed collaborative video authoring. The goal of this application is to assist (distributed) teams of amateur cinematographers in authoring video projects, and, through teamwork, to elevate the quality of user generated content.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Charles Krasic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krasic:Charles", "Jean-S\u00e9bastien L\u00e9gar\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=eacute=gar=eacute=:Jean=S=eacute=bastien"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
