Using data from 380 members of Congress' Twitter activity during the winter of 2012, we find that officials frequently use Twitter to advertise their political positions and to provide information but rarely to request political action from their constituents or to recognize the good work of others. We highlight a number of differences in communication frequency between men and women, Senators and Representatives, Republicans and Democrats. We provide groundwork for future research examining the behavior of public officials online and testing the predictive power of officials' social media behavior.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Libby Hemphill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hemphill:Libby", "Jahna Otterbacher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otterbacher:Jahna", "Matthew Shapiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shapiro:Matthew"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
