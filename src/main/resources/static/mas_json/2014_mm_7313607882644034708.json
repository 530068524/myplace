Our approach is centered around designing an effective method for displaying the image parts to the users such that they generate measurable brain reactions. When an image region, specifically a block of pixels, is displayed we estimate the probability of the block containing the object of interest using a score based on EEG activity. After several such blocks are displayed, the resulting probability map is binarized and combined with the GrabCut algorithm to segment the image into object and background regions. This study shows that BCI and simple EEG analysis are useful in locating object boundaries in images.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Dublin City University", "Dublin City University", "Dublin City University", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Dublin City University"], "authors": ["Eva Mohedano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohedano:Eva", "Graham Healy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Healy:Graham", "Kevin McGuinness.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGuinness:Kevin", "Xavier Gir\u00f3 i Nieto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nieto:Xavier_Gir=oacute=_i", "Noel E.
