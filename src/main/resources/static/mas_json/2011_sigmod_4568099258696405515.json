More specifically, our system U-Map uses query logs to generate correspondences between the attributes of two different schemas and the complex mapping rules to transform and restructure data records from one of these schemas to another. We introduce several novel features showing the benefit of incorporating query log analysis into these key components of data integration and data exchange systems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["AT&T Labs", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Hazem Elmeleegy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elmeleegy:Hazem", "Jaewoo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jaewoo", "El Kindi Rezig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezig:El_Kindi", "Mourad Ouzzani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouzzani:Mourad", "Ahmed K.
