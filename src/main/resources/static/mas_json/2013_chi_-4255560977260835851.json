When a thin magnetic sensor grid is attached to the back of the display, the 3D position and partial 3D orientation of the  GaussBits  can be resolved by the proposed bi-polar magnetic field tracking technique. This portable platform can therefore enrich tangible interactions by extending the design space to the near-surface space. Since non-ferrous materials, such as the user's hand, do not occlude the magnetic field, interaction designers can freely incorporate a magnetic unit into an appropriately shaped non-ferrous object to exploit the metaphors of the real-world tasks, and users can freely manipulate the  GaussBits  by hands or using other non-ferrous tools without causing interference. The presented example applications and the collected feedback from an explorative workshop revealed that this new approach is widely applicable.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan University of Science and Technology", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Rong-Hao Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Rong=Hao", "Kai-Yin Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Kai=Yin", "Li-Wei Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Li=Wei", "Chuan-Xhyuan Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Chuan=Xhyuan", "Mike Y.
