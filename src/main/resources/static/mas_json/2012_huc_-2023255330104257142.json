Rapid subject movement, non-controlled fast light variation and partial or total occlusions are the main problems that must be overcome. Furthermore, sunlight's infrared component makes it difficult the use of active artificial infrared light sources. In this paper, we describe a novel algorithm that combines Viola Jones face detector and TLD (Tracking Learning Detection) algorithm. In a standard driving scenario, it achieves a 84% rate of detection. Furthermore, we have designed a filtering stage that allows a low false positive rate. The algorithms hardware requirement is a standard web cam, and it can potentially work in real time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Navarra", "University of Navarra", "University of Navarra"], "authors": ["Jose Javier Bengoechea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengoechea:Jose_Javier", "Arantxa Villanueva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villanueva:Arantxa", "Rafael Cabeza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cabeza:Rafael"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
