{"title": "Summarizing Graph Patterns.", "fields": ["strength of a graph", "simplex graph", "complement graph", "null graph", "factor critical graph"], "abstract": "Several efficient frequent subgraph mining algorithms have been recently proposed. However, the number of frequent graph patterns generated by these graph mining algorithms may be too large to be effectively explored by users, especially when the support threshold is low. In this paper, we propose to summarize frequent graph patterns by a much smaller number of representative graph patterns. Several novel concepts such as delta- cover   graph,   jump   value   and   delta-jump   pattern  are proposed for efficiently summarizing frequent graph patterns. Based on the fact that all delta- jump   patterns  must be representative graph patterns, we propose two efficient algorithms for summarizing frequent graph patterns, RP-FP and RP-GD. The RP-FP algorithm computes representative graph patterns from a set of closed frequent graph patterns, whereas the RP-GD algorithm directly mines representative graph patterns from graph databases. Experimental results show that RP-FP and RP-GD are able to obtain compact summarization in both real and synthetic graph databases. When the number of closed graph patterns is very large, RP-GD is much more efficient than RP-FP, while achieving comparable summarization quality.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yong", "Jianzhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianzhong", "Hong Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Hong"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
