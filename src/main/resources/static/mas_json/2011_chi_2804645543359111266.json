We ran through the whole application development cycle, in miniature, from needs analysis through design, implementation, and evaluation, for planning needs of one NASA Mission Control group. Based on our needs analysis, we developed prototype software that matched domain structure better than did the legacy system. We compared our new prototype to the legacy application in a laboratory, high-fidelity analog of the natural planning work. We found large performance differences favoring the prototype, which better captured domain structure. Our research illustrates the importance of needs analysis (particularly Domain Structure Analysis), and the viability of the design process that we are exploring.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dorrit Billman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Billman:Dorrit", "Lucia Arsintescucu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arsintescucu:Lucia", "Michael Feary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feary:Michael", "Jessica Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jessica", "Asha Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Asha", "Rachna Tiwary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwary:Rachna"], "pages": 10}
