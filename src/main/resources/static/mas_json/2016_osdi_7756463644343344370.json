{"title": "Exploring the Hidden Dimension in Graph Processing.", "fields": ["graph partition", "cube", "vertex", "speedup"], "abstract": "Task partitioning of a graph-parallel system is traditionally considered equivalent to the graph partition problem. Such equivalence exists because the properties associated with each vertex/edge are normally considered indivisible. However, this assumption is not true for many Machine Learning and Data Mining (MLDM) problems: instead of a single value, a vector of data elements is defined as the property for each vertex/edge. This feature opens a new dimension for task partitioning because a vertex could be divided and assigned to different nodes.\n\nTo explore this new opportunity, this paper presents 3D partitioning, a novel category of task partition algorithms that significantly reduces network traffic for certain MLDM applications. Based on 3D partitioning, we build a distributed graph engine CUBE. Our evaluation results show that CUBE outperforms state-of-the-art graph-parallel system PowerLyra by up to 4:7\u00d7 (up to 7:3\u00d7 speedup against PowerGraph).", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "University of Southern California", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Mingxing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Mingxing", "Yongwei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yongwei", "Kang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kang", "Xuehai Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Xuehai", "Xue Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xue", "Weimin Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Weimin"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2016", "pages": 16}
