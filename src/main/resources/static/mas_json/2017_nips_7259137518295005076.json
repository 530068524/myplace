For both the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform and the angular kernel, we show that we can select matrices yielding guaranteed improved performance in accuracy and/or speed compared to earlier methods. We introduce matrices with complex entries which give significant further accuracy improvement. We provide geometric and Markov chain-based perspectives to help understand the benefits, and empirical results which suggest that the approach is helpful in a wider range of applications.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Krzysztof Marcin Choromanski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choromanski:Krzysztof_Marcin", "Mark Rowland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rowland:Mark", "Adrian Weller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weller:Adrian"], "pages": 10}
