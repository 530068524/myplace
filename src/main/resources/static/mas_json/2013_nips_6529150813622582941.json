At present it is usually solved by matching the sets pairwise, in series. In contrast, we propose a new method, Permutation Synchronization, which finds all the matchings jointly, in one shot, via a relaxation to eigenvector decomposition. The resulting algorithm is both computationally efficient, and, as we demonstrate with theoretical arguments as well as experimental results, much more stable to noise than previous methods.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Deepti Pachauri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pachauri:Deepti", "Risi Kondor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kondor:Risi", "Vikas Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Vikas"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
