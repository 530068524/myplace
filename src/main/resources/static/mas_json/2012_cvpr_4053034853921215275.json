We propose a novel \u201cshrink boost\u201d method to address this problem. It solves a sparse regularization problem with two iterative steps. First, a \u201cboosting\u201d step uses weighted training samples to learn a full high dimensional classifier on all features. This avoids over fitting to few features and improves generalization. Next, a \u201cshrinkage\u201d step shrinks least discriminative classifier dimension to zero to remove the redundant features. In our object detection system, we use \u201cshrink boost\u201d to select sparse features from histograms of local binary pattern (LBP) of multiple quantization and image channels to learn classifier of additive lookup tables (LUT). Our evaluation shows that our classifier has much better generalization than those from greedy based boosting and those from SVM methods, even under limited number of train samples. On public dataset of human detection and pedestrian detection, we achieve better performance than state of the arts. On our more challenging dataset of bird detection, we show promising results.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Panasonic", "Panasonic", "Panasonic", "Panasonic"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Cher Keng Heng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heng:Cher_Keng", "Sumio Yokomitsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yokomitsu:Sumio", "Yuichi Matsumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsumoto:Yuichi", "Hajime Tamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamura:Hajime"], "pages": 8}
