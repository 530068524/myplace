{"title": "Scaling deep learning on GPU and knights landing clusters.", "fields": ["deep learning", "gpu cluster", "speedup", "sync", "xeon phi"], "abstract": "Training neural networks has become a big bottleneck. For example, training ImageNet dataset on one Nvidia K20 GPU needs 21 days. To speed up the training process, the current deep learning systems heavily rely on the hardware accelerators. However, these accelerators have limited on-chip memory compared with CPUs.   We use both self-host Intel Knights Landing (KNL) clusters and multi-GPU clusters as our target platforms. From the algorithm aspect, we focus on Elastic Averaging SGD (EASGD) to design algorithms for HPC clusters.   We redesign four efficient algorithms for HPC systems to improve EASGD's poor scaling on clusters. Async EASGD, Async MEASGD, and Hogwild EASGD are faster than existing counter-part methods (Async SGD, Async MSGD, and Hogwild SGD) in all comparisons. Sync EASGD achieves 5.3X speedup over original EASGD on the same platform. We achieve 91.5% weak scaling efficiency on 4253 KNL cores, which is higher than the state-of-the-art implementation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Computer Science Division", "Computer Science Division", "Computer Science Division"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Yang You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Yang", "Aydin Bulu\u00e7.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulu=ccedil=:Aydin", "James Demmel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demmel:James"], "pages": 12}
