We describe the participatory design and longitudinal field testing of  Prism , a hybrid laboratory notebook that lets biologists capture, visualize and interact with cross-linked streams of physical and electronic data. We used Prism as a technology probe that users could adapt to integrate additional activity streams and share information from other biologists. Our key findings include the use of  master notebooks , whether paper or electronic, which act as a reference point for handling and organizing the diverse strands of personal activity, and the importance of  redundancy , which biologists use to make sense of their data. Prism provides a flexible, extensible tool that supports individual and collaborative reflection in creative work.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Aur\u00e9lien Tabard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tabard:Aur=eacute=lien", "Wendy E.
