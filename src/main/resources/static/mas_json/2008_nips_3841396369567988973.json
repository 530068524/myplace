Alternative model formulations, differing in their sensory noise models and inference methods, are compared based on their fit to experimental data. Heavy-tailed sensory likelihoods yield a better description of the subjects\u2019 response behavior than standard Gaussian noise models. We study the underlying cause for this result, and then present several testable predictions of these models.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of California, Los Angeles", "School of Informatics"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Rama Natarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Natarajan:Rama", "Iain Murray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray_0001:Iain", "Ladan Shams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shams:Ladan", "Richard S.
