It has been successfully adopted in a multitude of applications with low to medium dimensionality. However, multimedia applications commonly exhibit high-dimensional feature representations for which the computational complexity of the EMD hinders its adoption. An efficient query processing approach that mitigates and overcomes this effect is crucial. We propose novel dimensionality reduction techniques for the EMD in a filter-and-refine architecture for efficient lossless retrieval. Thorough experimental evaluation on real world data sets demonstrates a substantial reduction of the number of expensive high-dimensional EMD computations and thus remarkably faster response times. Our techniques are fully flexible in the number of reduced dimensions, which is a novel feature in approximation techniques for the EMD.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Marc Wichterich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wichterich:Marc", "Ira Assent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Assent:Ira", "Philipp Kranen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kranen:Philipp", "Thomas Seidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidl_0001:Thomas"], "pages": 14}
