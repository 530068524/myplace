{"title": "Apps on the move: A fine-grained analysis of usage behavior of mobile apps.", "fields": ["mobile web", "mobile search", "mobile technology", "mobile database", "mobile deep linking"], "abstract": "Owing to the proliferation of mobile devices and their corresponding app ecosystems, more and more people are accessing the internet via various mobile apps, which generates tremendous volume of mobile data. Despite the growing importance of these mobile apps, we have a rather sparse understanding of how they are accessed and what issues affect their usage patterns. To address this problem, we perform a comprehensive measurement on large-scale anonymized network data collected from a tier-1 cellular carrier in China. In this measurement, we characterize the usage pattern of mobile apps and exhibit how the mobility, geospatial properties and behaviours of subscribers affect their mobile app usage at a fine-grained level.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Huawei", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Soochow University"], "authors": ["Lin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Lin", "Mingxuan Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Mingxuan", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0050:Wei", "Qian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qian", "Jia Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Jia"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
