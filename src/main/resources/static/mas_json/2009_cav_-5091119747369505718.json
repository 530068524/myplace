Its goal is threefold: provide analysis implementers with ready-to-use numerical abstractions under a unified API, encourage the research in numerical abstract domains by providing a platform for integration and comparison, and provide teaching and demonstration tools to disseminate knowledge on abstract interpretation.", "citation": "Citations (388)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Bertrand Jeannet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeannet:Bertrand", "Antoine Min\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Min=eacute=:Antoine"], "pages": 7}
