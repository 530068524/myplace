We review existing (un)decidability results and identify a significant fragment of the logic for which model checking is decidable. We discuss aspects which makes model checking decidable and prove undecidability of two open fragments over a class of models in which agents always have a choice of doing nothing.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "Delft University of Technology", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Natasha Alechina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alechina:Natasha", "Nils Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Nils", "Brian Logan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Logan:Brian", "Hoang Nga Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hoang_Nga"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
