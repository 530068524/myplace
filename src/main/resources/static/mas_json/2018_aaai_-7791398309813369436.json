{"title": "Learning Binary Residual Representations for Domain-Specific Video Streaming.", "fields": ["fold", "binary number", "autoencoder", "residual", "channel capacity"], "abstract": "We study domain-specific video streaming. Specifically, we target a streaming setting where the videos to be streamed from a server to a client are all in the same domain and they have to be compressed to a small size for low-latency transmission. Several popular video streaming services, such as the video game streaming services of GeForce Now and Twitch, fall in this category. While conventional video compression standards such as H.264 are commonly used for this task, we hypothesize that one can leverage the property that the videos are all in the same domain to achieve better video quality. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a novel video compression pipeline. Specifically, we first apply H.264 to compress domain-specific videos. We then train a novel binary autoencoder to encode the leftover domain-specific residual information frame-by-frame into binary representations. These binary representations are then compressed and sent to the client together with the H.264 stream. In our experiments, we show that our pipeline yields consistent gains over standard H.264 compression across several benchmark datasets while using the same channel bandwidth.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "Nvidia", "Harvard University", "University of California, Merced", "University College London"], "authors": ["Yi-Hsuan Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Yi=Hsuan", "Ming-Yu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ming=Yu", "Deqing Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Deqing", "Ming-Hsuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Ming=Hsuan", "Jan Kautz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kautz:Jan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
