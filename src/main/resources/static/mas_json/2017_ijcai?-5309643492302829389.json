We show that CP solvers are able to solve these problems quicker than dedicated cryptanaly-sis tools, and we prove that a solution claimed to be optimal in two recent cryptanalysis papers is not optimal by providing a better solution.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Lyon", "University of Lyon"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["David Gerault.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerault:David", "Marine Minier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minier:Marine", "Christine Solnon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solnon:Christine"], "pages": 5}
