{"title": "This Time the Robot Settles for a Cost: A Quantitative Approach to Temporal Logic Planning with Partial Satisfaction.", "fields": ["proposition", "linear temporal logic", "robotics", "temporal logic", "abstraction"], "abstract": "The specification of complex motion goals through temporal logics is increasingly favored in robotics to narrow the gap between task and motion planning. A major limiting factor of such logics, however, is their Boolean satisfaction condition. To relax this limitation, we introduce a method for quantifying the satisfaction of co-safe linear temporal logic specifications, and propose a planner that uses this method to synthesize robot trajectories with the optimal satisfaction value. The method assigns costs to violations of specifications from user-defined proposition costs. These violation costs define a distance to satisfaction and can be computed algorithmically using a weighted automaton. The planner utilizes this automaton and an abstraction of the robotic system to construct a product graph that captures all possible robot trajectories and their distances to satisfaction. Then, a plan with the minimum distance to satisfaction is generated by employing this graph as the high-level planner in a synergistic planning framework. The efficacy of the method is illustrated on a robot with unsatisfiable specifications in an office environment.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Morteza Lahijanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lahijanian:Morteza", "Shaull Almagor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almagor:Shaull", "Dror Fried.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fried:Dror", "Lydia E.
