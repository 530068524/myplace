{"title": "Model-Powered Conditional Independence Test.", "fields": ["k nearest neighbors algorithm", "conditional independence", "joint probability distribution", "product distribution", "if and only if"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of non-parametric Conditional Independence testing (CI testing) for continuous random variables. Given i.i.d samples from the joint distribution $f(x,y,z)$ of continuous random vectors $X,Y$ and $Z,$ we determine whether $X \\independent Y \\vert Z$. We approach this by converting the conditional independence test into a classification problem. This allows us to harness very powerful classifiers like gradient-boosted trees and deep neural networks. These models can handle complex probability distributions and allow us to perform significantly better compared to the prior state of the art, for high-dimensional CI testing. The main technical challenge in the classification problem is the need for samples from the conditional product distribution $f^{CI}(x,y,z) = f(x|z)f(y|z)f(z)$ -- the joint distribution if and only if $X \\independent Y \\vert Z.$ -- when given access only to i.i.d. samples from the true joint distribution $f(x,y,z)$. To tackle this problem we propose a novel nearest neighbor bootstrap procedure and theoretically show that our generated samples are indeed close to $f^{CI}$ in terms of total variational distance. We then develop theoretical results regarding the generalization bounds for classification for our problem, which translate into error bounds for CI testing. We provide a novel analysis of Rademacher type classification bounds in the presence of non-i.i.d \\textit{near-independent} samples. We empirically validate the performance of our algorithm on simulated and real datasets and show performance gains over previous methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Google", "IBM", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Rajat Sen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sen:Rajat", "Ananda Theertha Suresh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suresh:Ananda_Theertha", "Karthikeyan Shanmugam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shanmugam:Karthikeyan", "Alexandros G.
