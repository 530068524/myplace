Twenty-six participant pairs engaged in a social dilemma investment game and chatted via Instant Messenger (IM) after every five rounds of investment. Results revealed that,  within chat sessions , lexical mimicry (repetition of words or word phrases by both partners) was significantly higher for high-trusting pairs than for low-trusting pairs, but that lexical mimicry  across chat sessions  was significantly higher for low-trusting pairs than for high-trusting pairs. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Lauren E.
