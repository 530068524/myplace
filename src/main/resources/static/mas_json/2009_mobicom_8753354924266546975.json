However, little work has yet been done on low-duty-cycle wireless sensor networks in which nodes stay asleep most of time and wake up asynchronously. In this type of network, a broadcasting packet is rarely received by multiple nodes simultaneously, a unique constraining feature that makes existing solutions unsuitable. Combined with unreliable links, flooding in low-duty-cycle networks is a new challenging issue.   In this paper, we introduce Opportunistic Flooding, a novel design tailored for low-duty-cycle networks with unreliable wireless links and predetermined working schedules. The key idea is to make probabilistic forwarding decisions at a sender based on the delay distribution of next-hop nodes. Only  opportunistically early  packets are forwarded using links outside the energy optimal tree to reduce the flooding delay and redundancy in transmission. To improve performance further, we propose a forwarder selection method to alleviate the hidden terminal problem and a link-quality-based backoff method to resolve simultaneous forwarding operations. We evaluate Opportunistic Flooding with extensive simulation and a test-bed implementation consisting of 30 MicaZ nodes. Evaluation shows our design is close to the optimal performance achievable by oracle flooding designs. Compared with improved traditional flooding, our design achieves significantly shorter flooding delay while consuming only 20% ~ 60% of the transmission energy in various low-duty-cycle network settings.", "citation": "Citations (274)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Minnesota", "Arista Networks", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Shuo Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Shuo", "Yu Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu_0001:Yu", "Bo Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Bo", "Tian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Tian"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
