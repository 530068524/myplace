{"title": "Proving Parameterized Systems Safe by Generalizing Clausal Proofs of Small Instances.", "fields": ["generalization", "mathematical proof", "parameterized complexity", "modular design", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "We describe an approach to proving safety properties of parameterized reactive systems. Clausal inductive proofs for small instances are generalized to quantified formulae, which are then checked against the whole family of systems. Clausal proofs are generated at the bit-level by the IC3 algorithm. The clauses are partitioned into blocks, each of which is represented by a quantified implication formula, whose antecedent is a conjunction of modular linear arithmetic constraints.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Michael Dooley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dooley:Michael", "Fabio Somenzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Somenzi:Fabio"], "pages": 18}
