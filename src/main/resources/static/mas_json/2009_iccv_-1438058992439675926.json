We characterize the possible distances, show that Euclidean distances can be exactly represented, and review some methods to approximate non-Euclidean distances in order to define novel total variation based regularizers. We show that the convex relaxed problem can be efficiently optimized to a prescribed accuracy with optimality certificates using Nesterov's method, and evaluate and compare our approach on several synthetical and real-world examples.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jan Lellmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lellmann:Jan", "Florian Becker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Becker:Florian", "Christoph Schn\u00f6rr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schn=ouml=rr:Christoph"], "pages": 8}
