However, there are very few studies which evaluated their appropriation in practice. In this paper, we present results of a case study of expert recommender technology in a large European industrial association. Unlike existing expert recommender approaches, the system involves users in selecting textual documents for semi-automatic profile generation. Our study focuses on the appropriation of this functionality and discusses impacts from an organizational perspective.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "University of Siegen"], "authors": ["Tim Reichling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reichling:Tim", "Volker Wulf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulf:Volker"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
