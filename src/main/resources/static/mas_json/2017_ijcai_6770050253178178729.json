When it comes to spatial data, the geo-coordinates are often considered independently as two different attributes. Consequently, rectangular shapes are searched for. Such an arbitrary form is not able to capture interesting regions in general. We thus introduce convex polygons, a good trade-off between expressiv-ity and algorithmic complexity. Our contribution is threefold: (i) We formally introduce such patterns in Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), (ii) we give all the basic bricks for mining convex polygons with exhaustive search and pattern sampling, and (iii) we design several algorithms, which we compare experimentally.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics", "National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics", "Institut national des sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon", "Institut national des sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon"], "authors": ["Aimene Belfodil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belfodil:Aimene", "Sergei O.
