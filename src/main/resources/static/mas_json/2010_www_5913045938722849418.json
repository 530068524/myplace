{"title": "Falconer: once SIOC meets semantic search engine.", "fields": ["semantic grid", "semantic search", "semantic compression", "semantic analytics", "social semantic web"], "abstract": "Falconer is a semantic Web search engine enhanced SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities) application, which is designed to demonstrate the ability of accelerating the creation and reuse process of semantic Web data with easy-to-use user interfaces. In this process, semantic Web search engines feed existing semantic data into the SIOC framework, where new semantic data are composed by the community and indexed again by those search engines. Compared to existing social (semantic) Web applications, Falconer inherently conforms to SIOC specification. It provides semantic search engine based user registration suggestion, friends auto-discovery, and semantic annotation for forum post content. Another distinctive feature is that it enables users to subscribe any resource having a URI as the topic they are interested in. The relationships among users, topics, and posts are further visualized for analyzing the topic trends in the community. As all semantic data are formatted in RDF and RDFa, they can be queried with SPARQL query language.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Southeast University", "Southeast University", "Southeast University", "Southeast University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Gang Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Gang", "Mengdong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Mengdong", "Ke Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ke", "Guilin Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Guilin", "Yuzhong Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Yuzhong"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
