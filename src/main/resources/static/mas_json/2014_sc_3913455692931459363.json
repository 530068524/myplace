{"title": "Managing DRAM Latency Divergence in Irregular GPGPU Applications.", "fields": ["conventional memory", "uniform memory access", "cuda pinned memory", "computing with memory", "interleaved memory"], "abstract": "Memory controllers in modern GPUs aggressively reorder requests for high bandwidth usage, often interleaving requests from different warps. This leads to high variance in the latency of different requests issued by the threads of a warp. Since a warp in a SIMT architecture can proceed only when all of its memory requests are returned by memory, such latency divergence causes significant slowdown when running irregular GPGPU applications. To solve this issue, we propose memory scheduling mechanisms that avoid inter-warp interference in the DRAM system to reduce the average memory stall latency experienced by warps. We further reduce latency divergence through mechanisms that coordinate scheduling decisions across multiple independent memory channels. Finally we show that carefully orchestrating the memory scheduling policy can achieve low average latency for warps, without compromising bandwidth utilization. Our combined scheme yields a 10.1% performance improvement for irregular GPGPU workloads relative to a throughput-optimized GPU memory controller.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Texas at Austin", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "University of Utah"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Niladrish Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Niladrish", "Mike O'Connor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Connor:Mike", "Gabriel H.
