In this paper, we introduce and analyze techniques for finding large coefficients. We show how a previously introduced search technique can be generalized from the Boolean case to the real-valued case, and we apply it in branch-and-bound and beam search algorithms that have significant advantages over the best-first algorithm in which the technique was originally introduced.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Brigham Young University", "Brigham Young University"], "authors": ["Adam Drake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drake:Adam", "Dan Ventura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Ventura:Dan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
