The theoretical analysis motivates us to introduce a new multi-class classification machine based on lp-norm regularization, where the parameter p controls the complexity of the corresponding bounds. We derive an efficient optimization algorithm based on Fenchel duality theory. Benchmarks on several real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant accuracy gains over the state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "Microsoft", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Humboldt University of Berlin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yunwen Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Yunwen", "\u00dcr\u00fcn Dogan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dogan:=Uuml=r=uuml=n", "Alexander Binder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binder:Alexander", "Marius Kloft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kloft:Marius"], "pages": 9}
