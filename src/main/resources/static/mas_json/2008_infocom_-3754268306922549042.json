We propose a \"Diamond\" pattern, which can be viewed as a series of different evolving patterns. When r c /r s  ges radic3, the Diamond pattern coincides with the well-known triangle lattice pattern; when r c /r s  ges radic2, it degenerates to a \"Square\" pattern. We prove the Diamond pattern to be asymptotically optimal when r c /r s  ges radic2- Our work is the first to propose an asymptotically optimal deployment pattern to achieve four connectivity and full coverage for WSNs. We hope our work will provide some insights on how optimal patterns evolve and how to search for them.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Xiaole Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Xiaole", "Ziqiu Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Ziqiu", "Dong Xuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xuan:Dong", "Ten-Hwang Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Ten=Hwang", "Weijia Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Weijia"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 5}
