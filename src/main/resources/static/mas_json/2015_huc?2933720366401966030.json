Using a prototype Quantified Workplace system equipped with passive and participatory sensing modalities, we collected and visualized different workplace metrics (noise, color, air quality, self reported mood, and self reported activity) in two European offices of a research organization for a period of 4 months. Next we surveyed 70 employees to understand their engagement experience with the system. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 employees in which they explained which workplace metrics are useful and why, how they engage with the system and what privacy concerns they have. Our findings suggest that sense of inclusion acts as the initial incentive for engagement which gradually translates into a habitual routine. We found that incorporation of an anonymous participatory sensing aspect into the system could lead to sustained user engagement. Compared to past studies we observed a shift in the privacy concerns, due to the trust and transparency of our prototype system. We conclude by providing a set of design principles for building future Quantified Workplace systems.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Akhil Mathur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathur:Akhil", "Marc Van den Broeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broeck:Marc_Van_den", "Geert Vanderhulst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanderhulst:Geert", "Afra J.
