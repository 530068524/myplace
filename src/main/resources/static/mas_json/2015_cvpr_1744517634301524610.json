Pedestrians were recorded \u201cin-the-wild\u201d from a moving vehicle. Annotations include bounding boxes, tracks, 14 keypoints with occlusion information and the fine-grained categories of age (5 classes), sex (2 classes), weight (3 classes) and clothing style (4 classes). There are a total of 27,454 bounding box and pose labels across 4222 tracks. This dataset is designed to train and test algorithms for fine-grained categorisation of people; it is also useful for benchmarking tracking, detection and pose estimation of pedestrians. State-of-the-art algorithms for fine-grained classification and pose estimation were tested using the dataset and the results are reported as a useful performance baseline.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["David Hall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hall:David", "Pietro Perona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perona:Pietro"], "pages": 10}
