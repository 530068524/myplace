A service hosted by a VM may also be migrated to prevent its visibility to an external adversary who may seek to disrupt its operation by launching a DDoS attack against it. We first show that current systems cannot adequately hide a VM migration from an external adversary. The key reason for this is that a migration typically manifests a traffic pattern with distinguishable statistical properties. We introduce two new attacks that can allow an adversary to effectively track a migration in progress, by leveraging observations of these properties. As our primary contribution, we design and implement a stealth migration framework that causes migration traffic to be indistinguishable from regular Internet traffic, with a negligible latency overhead of approximately 0.37 seconds, on average.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "University of California, Riverside", "Applied Communication Sciences"], "authors": ["Stefan Achleitner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achleitner:Stefan", "Thomas F.
