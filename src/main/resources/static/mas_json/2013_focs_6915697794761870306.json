We show that for these problems, polynomial-sized linear programs are no more powerful than programs arising from a constant number of rounds of the Sherali--Adams hierarchy. In particular, any polynomial-sized linear program for M ax  C ut  has an integrality gap of \u00bd and any such linear program for M ax  3-S at  has an integrality gap of f.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Washington", "University of California, Berkeley", "Cornell University", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "University of California, Berkeley", "Cornell University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Siu On Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Siu_On", "James R.
