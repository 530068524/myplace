Recently, the general purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU) has been widely used to accelerate numerous computational tasks. In this paper, we propose the first parallel variant of the A* search algorithm such that the search process of an agent can be accelerated by a single GPU processor in a massively parallel fashion. Our experiments have demonstrated that the GPU-accelerated A* search is efficient in solving multiple real-world search tasks, including combinatorial optimization problems, pathfinding and game solving. Compared to the traditional sequential CPU-based A* implementation, our GPU-based A* algorithm can achieve a significant speedup by up to 45x on largescale search problems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yichao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yichao", "Jianyang Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Jianyang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
