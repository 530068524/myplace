{"title": "Feature Enhancement Network: A Refined Scene Text Detector.", "fields": ["pooling", "detector", "object detection", "pattern recognition", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a refined scene text detector with a \\textit{novel} Feature Enhancement Network (FEN) for Region Proposal and Text Detection Refinement. Retrospectively, both region proposal with \\textit{only} $3\\times 3$ sliding-window feature and text detection refinement with \\textit{single scale} high level feature are insufficient, especially for smaller scene text. Therefore, we design a new FEN network with \\textit{task-specific}, \\textit{low} and \\textit{high} level semantic features fusion to improve the performance of text detection. Besides, since \\textit{unitary} position-sensitive RoI pooling in general object detection is unreasonable for variable text regions, an \\textit{adaptively weighted} position-sensitive RoI pooling layer is devised for further enhancing the detecting accuracy. To tackle the \\textit{sample-imbalance} problem during the refinement stage, we also propose an effective \\textit{positives mining} strategy for efficiently training our network. Experiments on ICDAR 2011 and 2013 robust text detection benchmarks demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming all reported methods in terms of F-measure.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["South China University of Technology", "South China University of Technology", "South China University of Technology"], "authors": ["Sheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Sheng", "Yuliang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yuliang", "Lianwen Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Lianwen", "Canjie Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Canjie"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
