{"title": "Hierarchical Skill Learning for High-Level Planning.", "fields": ["robot learning", "error driven learning", "reinforcement learning", "abstraction", "bootstrapping"], "abstract": "I present skill bootstrapping, a proposed new research direction for agent learning and planning that allows an agent to start with low-level primitive actions, and develop skills that can be used for higher-level planning. Skills are developed over the course of solving many different problems in a domain, using reinforcement learning techniques to complement the benefits and disadvantages of heuristic-search planning. I describe the overall architecture of the proposed approach and discuss how it relates to other work.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County"], "authors": ["James MacGlashan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/MacGlashan:James"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
