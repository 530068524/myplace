In this investigation, we sought to make good on a proof-of-concept where people interact with a social robot whereby the robot helps people to be more humanly creative. Twenty seven participants interacted with ATR's humanoid robot  Robovie  (through a WoZ interface) in a creativity task. Results supported our proof of concept insofar as 100% of the participants generated creative ideas, and 63% incorporated the robot's ideas into their own ideas for their creative output. Of the participants who had the highest creativity scores, 83% incorporated the robot's ideas into their own. Discussion focuses on next steps toward building the Natural Language Processing system, and integrating the system into a more extensive networked UbiComp environment.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Osaka University", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Intelligent Rob ...
