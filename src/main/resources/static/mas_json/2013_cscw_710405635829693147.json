However, when tightly-knit contacts (friends, family, colleagues) are not available, information seeking becomes more difficult. Inspired by previous work in social navigation, we developed WebWear, a system that collects and displays traces of activity for tightly-knit groups. WebWear allows people to use contextual knowledge of contacts' interests and activities to interpret the meaning of the traces, improving their usefulness. In a comparative study, we found that WebWear helped people complete information-seeking tasks more accurately, without requiring additional effort. A one-week field trial found that WebWear was both usable and useful, and that privacy concerns were reduced in the small-group context. WebWear shows that small-scale social navigation systems are feasible, and that they can improve the effectiveness of information seeking on the World-Wide Web.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Prince Edward Island", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan"], "authors": ["Scott Bateman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bateman:Scott", "Carl Gutwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gutwin:Carl", "Gordon I.
