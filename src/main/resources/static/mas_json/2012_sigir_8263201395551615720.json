However, this market appears to be inherently infested with a significant share of malicious workers who try to maximise their profits through cheating or sloppiness. This serves to undermine the very merits crowdsourcing has come to represent. Based on previous experience as well as psychological insights, we propose the use of a game in order to attract and retain a larger share of reliable workers to frequently-requested crowdsourcing tasks such as relevance assessments and clustering. In a large-scale comparative study conducted using recent TREC data, we investigate the performance of traditional HIT designs and a game-based alternative that is able to achieve high quality at significantly lower pay rates, facing fewer malicious submissions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "University of Iowa", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "University of Iowa"], "authors": ["Carsten Eickhoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eickhoff:Carsten", "Christopher G.
