Experiments found that the present approach outperforms in grammaticality and in relevance a dependency-centric approach (Oguro et al., 2000; Morooka et al., 2004; Yamagata et al., 2006; Fukutomi et al., 2007) \u2212 the only line of work in prior literature (on Japanese compression) we are aware of that allows replication and permits a direct comparison.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["National Institute of Japanese Literature"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Tadashi Nomoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nomoto:Tadashi"], "pages": 9}
