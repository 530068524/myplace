{"title": "Partial-Expansion A* with Selective Node Generation.", "fields": ["domain knowledge", "branching factor", "mathematical optimization", "machine learning", "pathfinding"], "abstract": "A* is often described as being 'optimal', in that it expands the minimum number of unique nodes. But, A* may generate many extra nodes which are never expanded. This is a performance loss, especially when the branching factor is large. Partial Expansion A* (PEA*) (Yoshizumi, Miura, and Ishida 2000) addresses this problem when expanding a node, n, by generating all the children of n but only storing children with the same f-cost as n. n is re-inserted into the OPEN list, but with the f-cost of the next best child. This paper introduces an enhanced version of PEA* (EPEA*). Given a priori domain knowledge, EPEA* generates only the children with the same f-cost as the parent. EPEA* is generalized to its iterative-deepening variant, EPE-IDA*. For some domains, these algorithms yield substantial performance improvements. State-of-the-art results were obtained for the pancake puzzle and for some multi-agent pathfinding instances. Drawbacks of EPEA* are also discussed.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Ariel Felner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felner:Ariel", "Meir Goldenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldenberg:Meir", "Guni Sharon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharon:Guni", "Roni Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Roni", "Tal Beja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beja:Tal", "Nathan R.
