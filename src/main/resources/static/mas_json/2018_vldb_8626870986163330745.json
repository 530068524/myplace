Using a single mathematical object called MultiAspect Graph (MAG) for this analysis, the multilayer perspective enables the unveiling of the particular strategies of each airline to both establish and adapt in a moment of crisis its specific flight network. Similarly, the time-varying perspective allows multi-scale analysis considering different time periods, and thus assessing the impact of the economic crisis on how the different airlines establish their routes as well as the flights that use these routes. Altogether, besides the multilayer and time-varying structural analysis of the Brazilian air transportation network, this paper also acts as a proof-of-concept for the MAG potential for the modeling and analysis of high-order networks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Michigan Career and Technical Institute", "Michigan Career and Technical Institute"], "authors": ["Klaus Wehmuth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wehmuth:Klaus", "Bernardo Costa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costa:Bernardo", "Jo\u00e3o Victor Bechara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bechara:Jo=atilde=o_Victor", "Artur Ziviani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Ziviani:Artur"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
