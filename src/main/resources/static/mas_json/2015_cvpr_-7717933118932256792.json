In our formulation, the depth cues from stereo matching and fog information reinforce each other, and produce superior results than conventional stereo or defogging algorithms. We first improve the photo-consistency term to explicitly model the appearance change due to the scattering effects. The prior matting Laplacian constraint on fog transmission imposes a detail-preserving smoothness constraint on the scene depth. We further enforce the ordering consistency between scene depth and fog transmission at neighboring points. These novel constraints are formulated together in an MRF framework, which is optimized iteratively by introducing auxiliary variables. The experiment results on real videos demonstrate the strength of our method.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Simon Fraser University", "SIM University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhuwen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhuwen", "Ping Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Ping", "Robby T.
