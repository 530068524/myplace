A model encompassing both hardware and software dynamics is developed together with an on-line estimation scheme in order reduce dependence on a-priori information. A control structure is presented in order to control performance under constrained resource situations and to reduce effects of estimation errors and disturbances. The approach is applied to a conversational video case and evaluated through simulations.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Lund University", "Lund University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Mikael Lindberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindberg:Mikael", "Karl-Erik \u00c5rz\u00e9n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Aring=rz=eacute=n:Karl=Erik"], "pages": 10}
