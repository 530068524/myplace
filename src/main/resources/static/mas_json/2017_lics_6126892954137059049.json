We identify the collection of heaps as an object in a different functor category equipped with a monad for adding hiding/encapsulation capabilities to the heaps. We derive a monad for full ground references supporting effect masking by applying a state monad transformer to the encapsulation monad. To evaluate the monad, we present a denotational semantics for a call-by-value calculus with full ground references, and validate associated code transformations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Birmingham", "University of Cambridge", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Ohad Kammar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kammar:Ohad", "Paul Blain Levy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levy:Paul_Blain", "Sean K.
