{"title": "Automatic melodic and structural analysis of music material for enriched concert related experiences.", "fields": ["new interfaces for musical expression", "theme", "musical composition", "melody", "modalities"], "abstract": "This PhD thesis proposal deals with the automatic analysis of musical audio, focusing on the estimation of the predominant melodic lines, which are used as a basis for extracting musical themes, and (along with other features) for structure recognition. The main focus is set on classical western music in large ensemble settings, which poses interesting research challenges to current state-of-the art algorithms. We will study the limitations of current approaches in this genre, and elaborate specific descriptors and methods, combining audio based analysis with further sources of knowledge and modalities. The creation of appropriate datasets will also be a main aspect, in order to properly evaluate the developed approaches. This work will be used to enrich musical concert related experiences, from music consumers to editors.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Pompeu Fabra University"], "authors": ["Juan J.
