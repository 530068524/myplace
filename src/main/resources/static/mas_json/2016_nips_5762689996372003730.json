MI changes the way of how the information flow gets integrated in the computational building block of an RNN, while introducing almost no extra parameters. The new structure can be easily embedded into many popular RNN models, including LSTMs and GRUs. We empirically analyze its learning behaviour and conduct evaluations on several tasks using different RNN models. Our experimental results demonstrate that Multiplicative Integration can provide a substantial performance boost over many of the existing RNN models.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Yuhuai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yuhuai", "Saizheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Saizheng", "Ying Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ying", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua", "Ruslan Salakhutdinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salakhutdinov:Ruslan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
