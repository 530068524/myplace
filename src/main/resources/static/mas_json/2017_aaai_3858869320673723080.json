{"title": "Causal Discovery Using Regression-Based Conditional Independence Tests.", "fields": ["equivalence class", "conditional independence", "markov chain", "curse of dimensionality", "kernel"], "abstract": "Conditional independence (CI) testing is an important tool in causal discovery. Generally, by using CI tests, a set of Markov equivalence classes w.r.t. the observed data can be estimated by checking whether each pair of variables  x  and  y  is  d -separated, given a set of variables  Z.  Due to the curse of dimensionality, CI testing is often difficult to return a reliable result for high-dimensional  Z.  In this paper, we propose a regression-based CI test to relax the test of  x  \u22a5  y | Z  to simpler unconditional independence tests of  x  \u2212  f ( Z ) \u22a5  y \u2212 g ( Z ), and  x \u2212 f ( Z ) \u22a5  Z  or  y \u2212 g ( Z ) \u22a5  Z  under the assumption that the data-generating procedure follows additive noise models (ANMs). When the ANM is identifiable, we prove that  x  \u2212  f ( Z ) \u22a5  y  \u2212  g ( Z ) \u21d2  x  \u22a5  y | Z . We also show that 1)  f  and  g  can be easily estimated by regression, 2) our test is more powerful than the state-of-the-art kernel CI tests, and 3) existing causal learning algorithms can infer much more causal directions by using the proposed method.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tongji University"], "authors": ["Hao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hao", "Shuigeng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Shuigeng", "Kun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Kun", "Jihong Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Jihong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
