Yet How-To content - including text, images, animations, and videos - is available online for a wide variety of crafts. We interviewed people engaged in various crafts to investigate how online resources contributed to their craft practice. We found that participants sought creative inspiration as well as technical clarification online. In this domain, keyword search can be difficult, so supplemental strategies are used. Participants sought information iteratively, because they often needed to enact their knowledge in order to evaluate it. Our description of people learning how allows us to elaborate existing understandings of information-seeking behavior by considering how search originates and is evaluated in knowledge domains involving physical objects and physical processes.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Yahoo!", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Cristen Torrey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torrey:Cristen", "Elizabeth F.
