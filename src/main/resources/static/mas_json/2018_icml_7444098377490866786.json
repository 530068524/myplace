Given a sample from a discrete distribution $p$, some functional $f$, and accuracy and privacy parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\varepsilon$, the goal is to estimate $f(p)$ up to accuracy $\\alpha$, while maintaining $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy of the sample. \nWe prove almost-tight bounds on the sample size required for this problem for several functionals of interest, including support size, support coverage, and entropy. We show that the cost of privacy is negligible in a variety of settings, both theoretically and experimentally. Our methods are based on a sensitivity analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for estimating these properties with sublinear sample complexities.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Jayadev Acharya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acharya:Jayadev", "Gautam Kamath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamath:Gautam", "Ziteng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Ziteng", "Huanyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Huanyu"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
