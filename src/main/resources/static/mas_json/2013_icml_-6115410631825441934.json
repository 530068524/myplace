{"title": "Cost-Sensitive Tree of Classifiers.", "fields": ["email spam", "traverse", "central processing unit", "computation", "search engine"], "abstract": "Recently, machine learning algorithms have successfully entered large-scale real-world industrial applications (e.g. search engines and email spam filters). Here, the CPU cost during test-time must be budgeted and accounted for. In this paper, we address the challenge of balancing the test-time cost and the classifier accuracy in a principled fashion. The test-time cost of a classifier is often dominated by the computation required for feature extraction--which can vary drastically across features. We decrease this extraction time by constructing a tree of classifiers, through which test inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different features and is optimized for a specific subpartition of the input space. By only computing features for inputs that benefit from them the most, our cost-sensitive tree of classifiers can match the high accuracies of the current state-of-the-art at a small fraction of the computational cost.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Zhixiang Eddie Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zhixiang_Eddie", "Matt J.
