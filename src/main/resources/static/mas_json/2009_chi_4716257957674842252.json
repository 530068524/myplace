Study participants used our tool, a simple browser-based textual note-taking utility, to capture personal information over the course of ten days. We examined the information they kept in notes using the tool, how this information was expressed, and aspects of note creation, editing, deletion, and search. We found that notes were recorded extremely quickly and tersely, combined information of multiple types, and were rarely revised or deleted. The results of the study demonstrate the need for a tool such as ours to support the rapid capture and retrieval of short notes-to-self, and afford insights into how users' actual note-keeping tendencies could be used to better support their needs in future PIM tools.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Max Van Kleek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleek:Max_Van", "Michael S.
