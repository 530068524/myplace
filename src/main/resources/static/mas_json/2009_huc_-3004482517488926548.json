In our setting, everyday objects are instrumented with UHF RFID tags called WISPs that are equipped with accelerometers. RFID readers detect when the objects are used by examining this sensor data, and daily activities are then inferred from the traces of object use via a Hidden Markov Model. In a study of 10 participants performing 14 activities in a model apartment, our approach yielded recognition rates with precision and recall both in the 90% range. This compares well to recognition with a more intrusive short-range RFID bracelet that detects objects in the proximity of the user; this approach saw roughly 95% precision and 60% recall in the same study. We conclude that RFID sensor networks are a promising approach for indoor activity monitoring.", "citation": "Citations (275)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Intel", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Michael Buettner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buettner:Michael", "Richa Prasad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prasad:Richa", "Matthai Philipose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Philipose:Matthai", "David Wetherall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wetherall:David"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
