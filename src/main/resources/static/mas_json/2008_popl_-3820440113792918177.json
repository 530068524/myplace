{"title": "Lifting abstract interpreters to quantified logical domains.", "fields": ["soundness", "sorting algorithm", "correctness", "pointer", "variable elimination"], "abstract": "We describe a general technique for building abstract interpreters over powerful  universally quantified  abstract domains that leverage existing quantifier-free domains. Our quantified abstract domain can represent universally quantified facts like \u2200 i (0 \u2264  i   n  \u21d2 \u03b1[ i ] = 0). The principal challenge in this effort is that, while most domains supply over-approximations of operations like join, meet, and variable elimination, working with the guards of quantified facts requires  under -approximation. We present an automatic technique to convert the standard over-approximation operations provided with all domains into sound under-approximations. We establish the correctness of our abstract interpreters by identifying two lattices---one that establishes the soundness of the abstract interpreter and another that defines its precision, or completeness. Our experiments on a variety of programs using arrays and pointers (including several sorting algorithms) demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on challenging examples.", "citation": "Citations (170)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of California, Berkeley", "SRI International"], "authors": ["Sumit Gulwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gulwani:Sumit", "Bill McCloskey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCloskey:Bill", "Ashish Tiwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwari:Ashish"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
