{"title": "Continuous sampling for online aggregation over multiple queries.", "fields": ["online aggregation", "exploit", "cosmos", "data flow diagram", "graph"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an online aggregation system called COSMOS (Continuous Sampling for Multiple queries in an Online aggregation System), to process multiple aggregate queries efficiently. In COSMOS, a dataset is first scrambled so that sequentially scanning the dataset gives rise to a stream of random samples for all queries. Moreover, COSMOS organizes queries into a dissemination graph to exploit the dependencies across queries. In this way, aggregates of queries closer to the root (source of data flow) can potentially be used to compute the aggregates of descendent/dependent queries. COSMOS applies some statistical approach to combine answers from ancestor nodes to generate the online aggregates for a node. COSMOS also offers a partitioning strategy to further salvage intermediate answers. We have implemented COSMOS and conducted an extensive experimental study in PostgreSQL. Our results on the TPC-H benchmark show the efficiency and effectiveness of COSMOS.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Sai", "Beng Chin Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Beng_Chin", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee"], "pages": 12}
