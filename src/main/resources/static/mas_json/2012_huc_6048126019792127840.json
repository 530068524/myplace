Few research teams have begun noticing that not only we need to offer appropriate services at the right time, but also that we need to adapt them to the resident profile. To do so, we must increase the accuracy and the granularity of our knowledge about the current state of environment. In this paper, we propose a new system based on the cheap and non intrusive passive RFID technology for fine grained localization of objects inside a smart home. We do so in regard for better service delivery by providing richer information about the environment.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi", "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi", "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi", "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi"], "authors": ["Kevin Bouchard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouchard:Kevin", "Jeremy Lapalu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lapalu:Jeremy", "Bruno Bouchard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouchard_0001:Bruno", "Abdenour Bouzouane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouzouane:Abdenour"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
