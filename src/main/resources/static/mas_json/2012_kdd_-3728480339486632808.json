{"title": "A shapelet transform for time series classification.", "fields": ["data mining", "explanatory power", "machine learning", "pattern recognition", "decision tree"], "abstract": "The problem of time series classification (TSC), where we consider any real-valued ordered data a time series, presents a specific machine learning challenge as the ordering of variables is often crucial in finding the best discriminating features. One of the most promising recent approaches is to find shapelets within a data set. A shapelet is a time series subsequence that is identified as being representative of class membership. The original research in this field embedded the procedure of finding shapelets within a decision tree. We propose disconnecting the process of finding shapelets from the classification algorithm by proposing a shapelet transformation. We describe a means of extracting the  k  best shapelets from a data set in a single pass, and then use these shapelets to transform data by calculating the distances from a series to each shapelet. We demonstrate that transformation into this new data space can improve classification accuracy, whilst retaining the explanatory power provided by shapelets.", "citation": "Citations (150)", "departments": ["University of East Anglia", "University of East Anglia", "University of East Anglia", "University of East Anglia"], "authors": ["Jason Lines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lines:Jason", "Luke M.
