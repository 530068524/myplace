To succeed in this endeavor, systems need to be able to extract and prove game-specific knowledge from the mere game rules. We present a practical approach to this challenge with the help of Answer Set Programming. The key idea is to reduce the automated theorem proving task to a simple proof of an induction step and its base case. We prove correctness of this method and report on experiments with an off-the-shelf Answer Set  Programming system in combination with a successful general game player.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Stephan Schiffel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiffel:Stephan", "Michael Thielscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thielscher:Michael"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
