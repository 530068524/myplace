{"title": "An online mechanism for dynamic virtual cluster provisioning in geo-distributed clouds.", "fields": ["virtual machine", "online algorithm", "revenue", "rationality", "provisioning"], "abstract": "It is common for cloud users to require clusters of inter-connected virtual machines (VMs) in a geo-distributed IaaS cloud, to run their services. Compared to isolated VMs, key challenges on dynamic virtual cluster (VC) provisioning (computation + communication resources) lie in two folds: (1) optimal placement of VCs and inter-VM traffic routing involve NP-hard problems, which are non-trivial to solve offline, not to mention if an online efficient algorithm is sought; (2) an efficient pricing mechanism is missing, which charges a market-driven price for each VC as a whole upon request, while maximizing system efficiency or provider revenue over the entire span. This paper proposes efficient online auction mechanisms to address the above challenges. We first design SWMOA, a novel online algorithm for dynamic VC provisioning and pricing, achieving truthfulness, individual rationality, computation efficiency, and (1 + 2 log \u03bc)-competitiveness in social welfare, where \u03bc is related to the problem size. Next, applying a randomized reduction technique, we convert the social welfare maximizing auction into a revenue maximizing online auction, PRMOA, achieving O(log \u03bc)-competitiveness in provider revenue, as well as truthfulness, individual rationality and computation efficiency. We validate the efficacy of the mechanisms through solid theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Weijie Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Weijie", "Chuan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Chuan", "Zongpeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zongpeng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
