Our framework allows to model arbitrary reactive protocol tasks (by specifying an ideal functionality) and comes with a universal composition theorem. We show that given natural setup assumptions, we can construct incoercible two-party protocols realising arbitrary functionalities (with respect to static adversaries).", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Dominique Unruh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unruh:Dominique", "J\u00f6rn M\u00fcller-Quade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller=Quade:J=ouml=rn"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2010", "pages": 18}
