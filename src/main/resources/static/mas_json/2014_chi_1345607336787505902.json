However, due to the high cost associated with the data collection process, many developing countries conduct such surveys very infrequently and include only a rather small sample of the population, thus failing to accurately capture the current socio-economic status of the country's population. In this paper, we address this problem by means of a methodology that relies on an alternative source of data from which to derive up to date poverty indicators, at a very fine level of spatio-temporal granularity. Taking two developing countries as examples, we show how to analyse the aggregated call detail records of mobile phone subscribers and extract features that are strongly correlated with poverty indexes currently derived from census data.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University College London", "Alcatel-Lucent", "University College London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christopher Smith-Clarke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith=Clarke:Christopher", "Afra J.
