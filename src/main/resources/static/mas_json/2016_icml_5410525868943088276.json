A proximal gradient homotopy algorithm is developed to solve the proposed optimization problem. Theoretically, we first prove that the proposed estimator attains a faster statistical rate than the traditional low-rank matrix estimator with nuclear norm penalty. Moreover, we rigorously show that under a certain condition on the magnitude of the nonzero singular values, the proposed estimator enjoys oracle property (i.e., exactly recovers the true rank of the matrix), besides attaining a faster rate. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Virginia"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Huan Gui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gui:Huan", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "Quanquan Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Quanquan"], "pages": 10}
