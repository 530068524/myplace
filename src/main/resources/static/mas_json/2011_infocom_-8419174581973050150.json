{"title": "Physical layer wireless security made fast and channel independent.", "fields": ["shared secret", "key distribution", "key generation", "physical layer", "bit error rate"], "abstract": "There is a growing interest in physical layer security. Recent work has demonstrated that wireless devices can generate a shared secret key by exploiting variations in their channel. The rate at which the secret bits are generated, however, depends heavily on how fast the channel changes. As a result, existing schemes have a low secrecy rate and are mainly applicable to mobile environments. In contrast, this paper presents a new physical-layer approach to secret key generation that is both fast and independent of channel variations. Our approach makes a receiver jam the signal in a manner that still allows it to decode the data, yet prevents other nodes from decoding. Results from a testbed implementation show that our method is significantly faster and more accurate than state of the art physical-layer secret key generation protocols. Specifically, while past work generates up to 44 secret bits/s with a 4% bit disagreement between the two devices, our design has a secrecy rate of 3\u201318 Kb/s with 0% bit disagreement.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Shyamnath Gollakota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollakota:Shyamnath", "Dina Katabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katabi:Dina"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
