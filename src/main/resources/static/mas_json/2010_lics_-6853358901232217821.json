{"title": "An Intuitionistic Logic that Proves Markov's Principle.", "fields": ["minimal logic", "predicate functor logic", "principle of explosion", "double negation", "predicate variable"], "abstract": "We design an intuitionistic predicate logic that supports a limited amount of classical reasoning, just enough to prove a variant of Markov's principle suited for predicate logic. At the computational level, the extraction of an existential witness out of a proof of its double negation is done by using a form of statically-bound exception mechanism, what can be seen as a direct-style variant of Friedman's A-translation.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Hugo Herbelin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herbelin:Hugo"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 7}
