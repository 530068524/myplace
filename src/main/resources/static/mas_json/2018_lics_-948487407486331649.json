{"title": "Concurrency and Probability: Removing Confusion, Compositionally.", "fields": ["confusion", "branching", "probabilistic logic", "concurrency", "recursion"], "abstract": "Assigning a satisfactory truly concurrent semantics to Petri nets with confusion and distributed decisions is a long standing problem, especially if one wants to resolve decisions by drawing from some probability distribution. Here we propose a general solution based on a recursive, static decomposition of (occurrence) nets in loci of decision, called structural branching cells (s-cells). Each s-cell exposes a set of alternatives, called transactions. Our solution transforms a given Petri net into another net whose transitions are the transactions of the s-cells and whose places are those of the original net, with some auxiliary structure for bookkeeping. The resulting net is confusion-free, and thus conflicting alternatives can be equipped with probabilistic choices, while nonintersecting alternatives are purely concurrent and their probability distributions are independent. The validity of the construction is witnessed by a tight correspondence with the recursively stopped configurations of Abbes and Benveniste. Some advantages of our approach are that: i) s-cells are defined statically and locally in a compositional way; ii) our resulting nets faithfully account for concurrency.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Pisa", "University of Buenos Aires", "University of Pisa"], "authors": ["Roberto Bruni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruni:Roberto", "Hern\u00e1n C.
