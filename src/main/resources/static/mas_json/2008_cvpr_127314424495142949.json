{"title": "Summarizing visual data using bidirectional similarity.", "fields": ["optimization problem", "similarity measure", "visual artifact", "versa", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "We propose a principled approach to summarization of visual data (images or video) based on optimization of a well-defined similarity measure. The problem we consider is re-targeting (or summarization) of image/video data into smaller sizes. A good ldquovisual summaryrdquo should satisfy two properties: (1) it should contain as much as possible visual information from the input data; (2) it should introduce as few as possible new visual artifacts that were not in the input data (i.e., preserve visual coherence). We propose a bi-directional similarity measure which quantitatively captures these two requirements: Two signals S and T are considered visually similar if all patches of S (at multiple scales) are contained in T, and vice versa. The problem of summarization/re-targeting is posed as an optimization problem of this bi-directional similarity measure. We show summarization results for image and video data. We further show that the same approach can be used to address a variety of other problems, including automatic cropping, completion and synthesis of visual data, image collage, object removal, photo reshuffling and more.", "citation": "Citations (485)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Adobe Systems", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Denis Simakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simakov:Denis", "Yaron Caspi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caspi:Yaron", "Eli Shechtman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shechtman:Eli", "Michal Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Michal"], "pages": -1}
