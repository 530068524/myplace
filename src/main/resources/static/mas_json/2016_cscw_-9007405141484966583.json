Today's tools, however, are based on the following assumptions: increased information encourages interaction, profiles are good representations of users to other users, and computer-mediated communications prior to face-to-face meetings lead to better outcomes. This paper describes CommonTies, a gentle technological in the form of a wearable accessory, that encourages immediate, face-to-face, organic social interactions among strangers at conferences. By not exposing any profile information, CommonTies preserves an element of mystery and enables self-disclosure of information through conversation. We evaluate our system through a field study at a three-day research conference - CSCW 2014. We find that despite our information-scarce design, users were willing to interact with strangers and 74% of the interactions initiated by CommonTies were reported as novel and useful.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["New York University Abu Dhabi", "Abu Dhabi"], "authors": ["Jay Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jay", "Azza Abouzied.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abouzied:Azza"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
