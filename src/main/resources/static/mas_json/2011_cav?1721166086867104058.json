{"title": "Complete Formal Hardware Verification of Interfaces for a FlexRay-Like Bus.", "fields": ["bus", "control bus", "back side bus", "local bus", "clock synchronization"], "abstract": "We report the first complete formal verification of a timetriggered bus interface at the gate and register level. We discuss hardware models for multiple clock domains and we review known results and proof techniques about the essential components of such bus interfaces: among others serial interfaces, clock synchronization and bus control. Combining such results into a single proof leads to an amazingly subtle theory about the realization of direct connections between units (as assumed in existing correctness proofs for components of interfaces) by properly controlled time-triggered buses. It also requires an induction arguing simultaneously about bit transmission across clock domains, clock synchronization and bus control.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Christian A.
