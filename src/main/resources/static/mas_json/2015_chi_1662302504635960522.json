{"title": "Content Destabilization for Head-Mounted Displays.", "fields": ["multimedia", "head up display", "computer science"], "abstract": "With recent progress in display technology, visual see-through head-mounted displays are beginning to enter our everyday lives. Especially in cars they may replace head-up displays, as they can theoretically perfectly imitate them but are more flexible to use. However, prior work has shown that both screen- and vehicle-stabilized content suffer from drawbacks such as occlusion or technological limitations. As a potential alternative, we propose three concept alternatives, in which head rotation is used to manipulate the displayed content differently from both of the known stabilization techniques. In a qualitative user study, we identify the best concept proposal and then evaluate it against the established content stabilization techniques. The presented concept is perceived to be more applicable for the proposed use case and effectively reduces some of the known problems of both stabilization techniques.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Felix Lauber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lauber:Felix", "Sophia Cook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cook:Sophia", "Andreas Butz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Butz:Andreas"], "pages": 4}
