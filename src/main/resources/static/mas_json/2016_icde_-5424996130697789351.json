{"title": "Efficient handling of concept drift and concept evolution over Stream Data.", "fields": ["margin classifier", "concept drift", "exploit", "quadratic classifier", "sliding window protocol"], "abstract": "To decide if an update to a data stream classifier is necessary, existing sliding window based techniques monitor classifier performance on recent instances. If there is a significant change in classifier performance, these approaches determine a chunk boundary, and update the classifier. However, monitoring classifier performance is costly due to scarcity of labeled data. In our previous work, we presented a semi-supervised framework SAND, which uses change detection on classifier confidence to detect a concept drift. Unlike most approaches, it requires only a limited amount of labeled data to detect chunk boundaries and to update the classifier. However, SAND is expensive in terms of execution time due to exhaustive invocation of the change detection module. In this paper, we present an efficient framework, which is based on the same principle as SAND, but exploits dynamic programming and executes the change detection module selectively. Moreover, we provide theoretical justification of the confidence calculation, and show effect of a concept drift on subsequent confidence scores. Experiment results show efficiency of the proposed framework in terms of both accuracy and execution time.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "IBM"], "authors": ["Ahsanul Haque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haque:Ahsanul", "Latifur Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Latifur", "Michael Baron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baron:Michael", "Bhavani M.
