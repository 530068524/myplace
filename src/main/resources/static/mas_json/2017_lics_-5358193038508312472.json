The abstract lattice is finite and has the following key properties. (i) There is a Galois insertion between it and the lattice of languages of finite and infinite words over a given alphabet. (ii) The abstraction is faithful with respect to acceptance by the automaton. (iii) Least fixpoints and \u03c9-iterations (but not in general greatest fixpoints) can be computed on the level of the abstract lattice.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "authors": ["Martin Hofmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofmann_0001:Martin", "J\u00e9r\u00e9my Ledent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ledent:J=eacute=r=eacute=my"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
