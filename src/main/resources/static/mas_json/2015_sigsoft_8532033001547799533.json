To address this need, we introduce UEDashboard, a tool which automatically detects unusual events in a commit history based on metrics and smells, and surfaces them in an event feed. Our preliminary evaluation with a team of professional software developers showed that our conceptualization of unusual correlates with developers' perceptions of task difficulty, and that UEDashboard could be useful in supporting development meetings and for pre-commit warnings.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte", "Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte", "Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte"], "authors": ["Larissa Leite.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leite:Larissa", "Christoph Treude.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Treude:Christoph", "Fernando Marques Figueira Filho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filho:Fernando_Marques_Figueira"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
