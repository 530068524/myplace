{"title": "Image-Based Synthesis and Re-synthesis of Viewpoints Guided by 3D Models.", "fields": ["training set", "image based modeling and rendering", "inpainting", "active appearance model", "engineering physics", "viewpoints", "computer science", "applied mathematics"], "abstract": "We propose a technique to use the structural informa- tion extracted from a set of 3D models of an object class to improve novel-view synthesis for images showing unknown instances of this class. These novel views can be used to \"amplify\" training image collections that typically contain only a low number of views or lack certain classes of views entirely (e. g. top views). We extract the correlation of position, normal, re- flectance and appearance from computer-generated images of a few exemplars and use this information to infer new appearance for new instances. We show that our approach can improve performance of state-of-the-art detectors using real-world training data. Additional applications include guided versions of inpainting, 2D-to-3D conversion, super- resolution and non-local smoothing.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Konstantinos Rematas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rematas:Konstantinos", "Tobias Ritschel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ritschel:Tobias", "Mario Fritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fritz:Mario", "Tinne Tuytelaars.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuytelaars:Tinne"], "pages": 8}
