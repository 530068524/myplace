{"title": "On Approximating Maximum Independent Set of Rectangles.", "fields": ["approximation algorithm", "open problem", "binary logarithm", "log log plot", "independent set"], "abstract": "We study the Maximum Independent Set of Rectangles (MISR) problem: given a set of n axis-parallel rectangles, find a largest-cardinality subset of the rectangles, such that no two of them overlap. MISR is a basic geometric optimization problem with many applications, that has been studied extensively. Until recently, the best approximation algorithm for it achieved an O(log log n)-approximation factor. In a recent breakthrough, Adamaszek and Wiese provided a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme: a (1-e)-approximation algorithm with running time nO(poly(log n)/e). Despite this result, obtaining a PTAS or even a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation remains a challenging open problem. In this paper we make progress towards this goal by providing an algorithm for MISR that achieves a (1-e)-approximation in time nO(poly(log logn/e)). We introduce several new technical ideas, that we hope will lead to further progress on this and related problems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "University of Warwick"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Julia Chuzhoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuzhoy:Julia", "Alina Ene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ene:Alina"], "pages": 10}
