Engineering such applications is challenging with a need for health care plan meta-models, per-patient instantiation of care plans, and development and deployment of supporting Web and mobile device applications. We describe a novel prototype environment for visually modelling health care plans and automated plan and mobile device application code generation.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Auckland", "University of Auckland", "University of Auckland", "University of Auckland"], "authors": ["Abizer Khambati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khambati:Abizer", "John C.
