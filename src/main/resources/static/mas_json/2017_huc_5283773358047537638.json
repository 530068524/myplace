By using the method, we can analyze the behavior of the attendees at some large-scale exhibition, such as the order of the visited booth and the duration of the stay. Using mobile BLE tags has some advantages: to collect a large amount of data easily, to provide location estimation without smart-phones. However, in a real environment, the BLE signal is unstable due to many people and obstacles. Fingerprinting is difficult because arranging booths finishes few hours before exhibition starts. Our previous trilateration method resulted in 10--30 meter accuracy with the data collected at Geospatial EXPO 2015 because of packet loss. We, to decrease packet loss, have developed  tandem scanner  that is equipped with multiple Bluetooth adapters. This paper presents the result of the improved method with the data collected by tandem scanners at Geospatial EXPO 2016. We also examined what improves accuracy: shorter advertising interval of the BLE tag and a larger number of tandem scanner's available adapters. Average location estimation accuracy was 4.51 meters when using best settings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nagoya University", "Aichi Institute of Technology", "Nagoya University", "Nagoya University"], "authors": ["Kenta Urano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urano:Kenta", "Katsuhiko Kaji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaji:Katsuhiko", "Kei Hiroi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hiroi:Kei", "Nobuo Kawaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawaguchi:Nobuo"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
