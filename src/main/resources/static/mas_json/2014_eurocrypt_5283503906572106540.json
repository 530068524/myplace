Assume that we have some cryptographic application P that expects a uniformly random m-bit key R and ensures that the best attack (in some complexity class) against P(R) has success probability at most \u03b4. Our goal is to design a key-derivation function (KDF) h that converts any random source X of min-entropy k into a sufficiently \u201cgood\u201d key h(X), guaranteeing that P(h(X)) has comparable security \u03b4\u2032 which is \u2018close\u2019 to \u03b4.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["New York University", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Yevgeniy Dodis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodis:Yevgeniy", "Krzysztof Pietrzak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietrzak:Krzysztof", "Daniel Wichs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wichs:Daniel"], "pages": 18}
