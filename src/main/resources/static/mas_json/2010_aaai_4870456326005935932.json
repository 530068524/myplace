Our approach uses thread and data parallelism to achieve high performance for all components of sample-based algorithms, including random sampling, nearest neighbor computation, local planning, collision queries and graph search. This approach can efficiently solve both the multi-query and single-query versions of the problem and obtain considerable speedups over prior CPU-based algorithms. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms by applying them to a number of 6DOF planning benchmarks in 3D environments. Overall, this is the first algorithm that can perform real-time motion planning and global navigation using commodity hardware.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Jia Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Jia", "Christian Lauterbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lauterbach:Christian", "Dinesh Manocha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manocha:Dinesh"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
