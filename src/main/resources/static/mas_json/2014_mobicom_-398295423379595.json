Based on in-depth understanding of the nature of the MEMS gyroscope and other IMU sensors commonly equipped on smartphones, we propose A 3  - an accurate and automatic attitude detector for commodity smartphones. A 3  primarily leverages the gyroscope, but intelligently incorporates the accelerometer and magnetometer to select the best sensing capabilities and derive the most accurate attitude estimation. Extensive experimental evaluation on various types of Android smartphones confirms the outstanding performance of A 3 . Compared with other existing solutions, A 3  provides 3x improvement on the accuracy of attitude estimation.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Pengfei Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Pengfei", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo", "Guobin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Guobin"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
