{"title": "Every \u03bb-Term is Meaningful for the Infinitary Relational Model.", "fields": ["relational model", "denotation", "arity", "curry howard correspondence", "coinduction"], "abstract": "Infinite types and formulas are known to have really curious and unsound behaviors. For instance, they allow to type \u03a9, the auto-autoapplication and they thus do not ensure any form of normalization/productivity. Moreover, in most infinitary frameworks, it is not difficult to define a type R that can be assigned to every \u03bb-term. However, these observations do not say much about what coinductive (i.e. infinitary) type grammars are able to provide: it is for instance very difficult to know what types (besides R) can be assigned to a given term in this setting. We begin with a discussion on the expressivity of different forms of infinite types. Then, using the resource-awareness of sequential intersection types (system S) and tracking, we prove that infinite types are able to characterize the arity of every \u03bb-terms and that, in the infinitary extension of the relational model, every term has a \"meaning\" i.e. a non-empty denotation. From the technical point of view, we must deal with the total lack of guarantee of productivity for typable terms: we do so by importing methods inspired by first order model theory.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Pierre Vial.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vial:Pierre"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
