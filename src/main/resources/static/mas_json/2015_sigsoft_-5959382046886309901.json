To inform tool design for making sense of the information available about a developer's activity, we conducted an empirical study with 156 GitHub users to investigate what information they would expect in a summary of development activity, how they would measure development activity, and what factors influence how such activity can be condensed into textual summaries or numbers. We found that unexpected events are as important as expected events in summaries of what a developer did, and that many developers do not believe in measuring development activity. Among the factors that influence summarization and measurement of development activity, we identified development experience and programming languages.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte", "Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte", "Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte"], "authors": ["Christoph Treude.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Treude:Christoph", "Fernando Marques Figueira Filho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filho:Fernando_Marques_Figueira", "Uir\u00e1 Kulesza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulesza:Uir=aacute="], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
