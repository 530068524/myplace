Research to date has mainly focused on non-cooperative networking games, where the selfish agents cannot reach a binding agreement on the way they would share the network infrastructure and the operating points are the Nash equilibria. These are typically inefficient, as manifested by large values of the Price of Anarchy (PoA). Many approaches have been proposed for mitigating this problem, however under the standing assumption of a non-cooperative game.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Gideon Blocq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blocq:Gideon", "Ariel Orda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orda:Ariel"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
