{"title": "Instant Advertising in Mobile Peer-to-Peer Networks.", "fields": ["location awareness", "peer to peer", "mobile radio", "cost efficiency", "dissemination"], "abstract": "To explore the benefit of advertising instant and location-aware commercials that can not be effectively promoted by traditional medium like TV program and Internet, we propose in this paper a solution for disseminating instant advertisements to users within the area of interest through a Mobile Peer-to-Peer Network. This is a new application scenario, and we devise an opportunistic gossiping model for advertisement propagation with spatial and temporal constraints. As bandwidth and computational resources are limited in a wireless environment, two optimization mechanisms utilizing distance and velocity information are provided for reducing redundant advertising messages. User interest is also considered as another critica factor in adjusting the advertisement propagation model, and we adopt the FM algorithm to achieve efficient counting of distinct users' interests. Finally, we study the performance of our solution through simulation in NS-2. Compared with the naive flooding method, our approach achieves high quality delivery rate while reducing the number of messages by nearly an order of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "Peking University", "University of Queensland"], "authors": ["Zaiben Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zaiben", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao", "Quanqing Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Quanqing", "Xiaofang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaofang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
