However, constructing such a methodology with existing tools is a significant challenge due to the unique languages, design patterns, and tools used in functional-level (FL), cycle-level (CL), and register-transfer-level (RTL) modeling. We introduce a new framework called PyMTL that aims to close this computer architecture research methodology gap by providing a unified design environment for FL, CL, and RTL modeling. PyMTL leverages the Python programming language to create a highly productive domain-specific embedded language for concurrent-structural modeling and hardware design. While the use of Python as a modeling and framework implementation language provides considerable benefits in terms of productivity, it comes at the cost of significantly longer simulation times. We address this performance-productivity gap with a hybrid JIT compilation and JIT specialization approach. We introduce Sim JIT, a custom JIT specialization engine that automatically generates optimized C++ for CL and RTL models. To reduce the performance impact of the remaining unspecialized code, we combine Sim JIT with an off-the-shelf Python interpreter with a meta-tracing JIT compiler (PyPy). Sim JIT+PyPy provides speedups of up to 72\u00d7 for CL models and 200\u00d7 for RTL models, bringing us within 4--6\u00d7 of optimized C++ code while providing significant benefits in terms of productivity and usability.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Derek Lockhart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lockhart:Derek", "Gary Zibrat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zibrat:Gary", "Christopher Batten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Batten:Christopher"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2014", "pages": 13}
