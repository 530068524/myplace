Longitudinal surveys matched to server logs from 415 Facebook users reveal that receiving messages from friends is associated with increases in bridging social capital, but that other uses are not. However, using the site to passively consume news assists those with lower social fluency draw value from their connections. The results inform site designers seeking to increase social connectedness and the value of those connections.", "citation": "Citations (590)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Facebook"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Moira Burke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burke:Moira", "Robert E.
