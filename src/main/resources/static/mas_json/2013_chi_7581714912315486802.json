However, collaboration is not among their strengths. With the advent of embedded projectors this might change. We conducted a study with 56 participants to find out if map navigation and spatial memory performance among users and observers can be improved by using a projector phone with a peephole interface instead of a smartphone with its touchscreen interface. Our results show that users performed map navigation equally well on both interfaces. Spatial memory performance, however, was 41% better for projector phone users. Moreover, observers of the map navigation on the projector phone were 25% more accurate when asked to recall locations of points of interest after they watched a user performing map navigation.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt", "Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt"], "authors": ["Bonifaz Kaufmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufmann:Bonifaz", "David Ahlstr\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahlstr=ouml=m:David"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
