We surveyed 550 participants to understand how people sit in chairs and inform the design of a chair that detects heart and respiratory rate from the armrests and backrests of the chair respectively. In a laboratory study with 18 participants, we evaluated a range of common sitting positions to determine when heart rate and respiratory rate detection was possible (32% of the time for heart rate, 52% for respiratory rate) and evaluate the accuracy of the detected rate (83% for heart rate, 73% for respiratory rate). We discuss the challenges of moving this sensing to the wild by evaluating an in-situ study totaling 40 hours with 11 participants. We show that, as an implicit sensor, the chair can collect vital signs data from its occupant through natural interaction with the chair.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Erin Griffiths.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Griffiths:Erin", "T.
