In this paper, we introduce an algorithmic framework for studying combinatorial problems in the presence of multiple agents with submodular cost functions. We study several fundamental covering problems (Vertex Cover, Shortest Path, Perfect Matching, and Spanning Tree) in this setting and establish tight upper and lower bounds for the approximability of these problems", "citation": "Citations (85)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Gagan Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Gagan", "Chinmay Karande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karande:Chinmay", "Pushkar Tripathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tripathi:Pushkar", "Lei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0010:Lei"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
