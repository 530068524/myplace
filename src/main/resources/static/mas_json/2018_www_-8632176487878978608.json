{"title": "What We Read, What We Search: Media Attention and Public Attention Among 193 Countries.", "fields": ["odds", "news media", "granger causality", "brexit", "terrorism"], "abstract": "In this research, we investigate the alignment of international attention of news media organizations within 193 countries with the expressed international interests of the public within those same countries from March 7, 2016 to April 14, 2017. We collect fourteen months of large-scale longitudinal data of online news from Unfiltered News and web search volume from Google Trends. We build a multiplex network of media attention and public attention in order to study its structural and dynamic properties, along with investigating specific topical interests by country. Structurally, the media attention and the public attention are both similar and different depending on the resolution of the analysis. For example, we find that 63.2\\% of the country-specific media and the public pay the attention to different countries, but local attention flow patterns, which are measured by network motifs, are very similar. We also show that there are strong regional similarities with both media and public attention that is only disrupted by significantly major worldwide incidents (e.g., Brexit, Nice Terrorist Attack). Using Granger causality, we show that there are a substantial number of countries where media attention and public attention are dissimilar by topical interest. Our findings show that the media and public attention toward specific countries are often at odds indicating that the public within these countries may be ignoring their country-specific news outlets and seeking other online sources to address their media needs and desires.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Khalifa University", "Khalifa University", "Khalifa University", "Khalifa University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Haewoon Kwak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwak:Haewoon", "Jisun An.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/An:Jisun", "Joni Salminen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salminen:Joni", "Soon-Gyo Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Soon=Gyo", "Bernard J.
