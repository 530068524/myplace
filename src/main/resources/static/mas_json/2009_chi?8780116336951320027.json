This paper introduces qualitative video-based observations of Japanese families using an interactive portable guide system in a museum. Results show how unexpected usage can occur through particularities of interaction between family members. The paper highlights the necessity to more fully consider familial relationships in HCI.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "National Museum of Ethnology", "National Museum of Ethnology", "ATR Cognitive I ... s, Kyoto, Japan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tom Hope.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hope:Tom", "Yoshiyuki Nakamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakamura:Yoshiyuki", "Toru Takahashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takahashi:Toru", "Atsushi Nobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nobayashi:Atsushi", "Shota Fukuoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukuoka:Shota", "Masahiro Hamasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamasaki:Masahiro", "Takuichi Nishimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishimura:Takuichi"], "pages": 10}
