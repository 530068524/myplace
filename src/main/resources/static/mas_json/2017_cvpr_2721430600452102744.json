{"title": "Discriminative Correlation Filter with Channel and Spatial Reliability.", "fields": ["benchmark", "weighting", "discriminative model", "channel", "channel reliability"], "abstract": "Short-term tracking is an open and challenging problem for which discriminative correlation filters (DCF) have shown excellent performance. We introduce the channel and spatial reliability concepts to DCF tracking and provide a novel learning algorithm for its efficient and seamless integration in the filter update and the tracking process. The spatial reliability map adjusts the filter support to the part of the object suitable for tracking. This allows tracking of non-rectangular objects as well as extending the search region. Channel reliability reflects the quality of the learned filter and it is used as a feature weighting coefficient in localization. Experimentally, with only two simple standard features, HOGs and Colornames, the novel CSR-DCF method \u2013 DCF with Channel and Spatial Reliability \u2013 achieves state-of-the-art results on VOT 2016, VOT 2015 and OTB. The CSR-DCF runs in real-time on a CPU.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Ljubljana", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "University of Ljubljana", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "University of Ljubljana"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Alan Lukezic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lukezic:Alan", "Tomas Vojir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vojir:Tomas", "Luka Cehovin Zajc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zajc:Luka_Cehovin", "Jiri Matas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matas:Jiri", "Matej Kristan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kristan:Matej"], "pages": 10}
