We view our approach as a step forward from using only low-level visual feature cues, towards the eventual goal of high-level seman- tic understanding of feature films. Our approach decom- poses each trailer into a collection of keyframes through shot boundary analysis. From these keyframes, we use state-of- the-art scene detectors and descriptors to extract features, which are then used for shot categorization via unsuper- vised learning. This allows us to represent trailers using a bag-of-visual-words (bovw) model with shot classes as vo- cabularies. We approach the genre classification task by mapping bovw temporally structured trailer features to four high-level movie genres: action, comedy, drama or horror films. We have conducted experiments on 1239 annotated trailers. Our experimental results demonstrate that exploit- ing scene structures improves film genre classification com- pared to using only low-level visual features.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Howard Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Howard", "Tucker Hermans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hermans:Tucker", "Asmita V.
