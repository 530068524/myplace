How do we re-understand about human knowledge and knowing? This work aims at extending the current understanding of human epistemic cognition in online social environments, where epistemic cognition refers to cognitions and cognitive processes related to epistemic matters such as knowledge and beliefs justification. We approach our inquiry with mixed methods: (1) quantitative study to test whether epistemic cognition might differ in individual and social contexts, and whether online interactions might mediate the later; and (2) social cognitive task analysis with interviews to manifest the intricate interplay of dynamics between social epistemic cognition and online interactions. We introduce the new construct of social epistemic cognition and contribute to the field of HCI with an evolved theory which states that epistemic cognition can be promoted in online social environments as mediated by online interactions.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Lingnan University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rosanna Yuen-Yan Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Rosanna_Yuen=Yan", "Silu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Silu", "Diane Hui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hui:Diane"], "pages": 10}
