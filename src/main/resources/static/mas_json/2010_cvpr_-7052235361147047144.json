We formalize the convex decomposition problem as an integer linear programming problem, and obtain approximate optimal solution by minimizing the total cost of decomposition under some concavity constraints. Our method is based on Morse theory and combines information from multiple Morse functions. The obtained decomposition provides a compact representation, both geometrical and topological, of original object. Our experiments show that such representation is very useful in many applications.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Temple University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hairong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hairong", "Wenyu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wenyu", "Longin Jan Latecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Latecki:Longin_Jan"], "pages": 8}
