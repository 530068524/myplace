The behavior of the circuit is based on a subtractive single release model of STD. Experimental results agree well with simulation and exhibit expected STD behavior: the transmitted spike train has negative autocorrelation and lower power spectral density at low frequencies which can remove redundancy in the input spike train, and the mean transmission probability is inversely proportional to the input spike rate which has been suggested as an automatic gain control mechanism in neural systems. The dynamic stochastic synapse could potentially be a powerful addition to existing deterministic VLSI spiking neural systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Peng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Peng", "Timothy K.
