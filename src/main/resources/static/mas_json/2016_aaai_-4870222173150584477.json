{"title": "Scaling Relational Inference Using Proofs and Refutations.", "fields": ["counterexample", "soundness", "exploit", "mathematical proof", "speedup"], "abstract": "Many inference problems are naturally formulated using hard and soft constraints over relational domains: the desired solution must satisfy the hard constraints, while optimizing the objectives expressed by the soft constraints. Existing techniques for solving such constraints rely on efficiently grounding a sufficient subset of constraints that is tractable to solve. We present an eager-lazy grounding algorithm that eagerly exploits proofs and lazily refutes counterexamples. We show that our algorithm achieves significant speedup over existing approaches without sacrificing soundness for real-world applications from information retrieval and program analysis.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ravi Mangal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mangal:Ravi", "Xin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xin", "Aditya Kamath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamath:Aditya", "Aditya V.
