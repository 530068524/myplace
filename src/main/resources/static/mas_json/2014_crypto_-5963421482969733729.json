{"title": "Maliciously Circuit-Private FHE.", "fields": ["homomorphic encryption", "ciphertext", "communication source", "bootstrapping", "public key cryptography"], "abstract": "We present a framework for transforming FHE (fully homomorphic encryption) schemes with no circuit privacy requirements into maliciously circuit-private FHE. That is, even if both maliciously formed public key and ciphertext are used, encrypted outputs only reveal the evaluation of the circuit on some well-formed input x*. Previous literature on FHE only considered semi-honest circuit privacy. Circuit-private FHE schemes have direct applications to computing on encrypted data. In that setting, one party (a receiver) holding an input x wishes to learn the evaluation of a circuit C held by another party (a sender). The goal is to make receiver\u2019s work sublinear (and ideally independent) of \\(\\left\\lvert C \\right\\rvert \\), using a 2-message protocol. The transformation technique may be of independent interest, and have various additional applications. The framework uses techniques akin to Gentry\u2019s bootstrapping and conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS [AIR01]) combining a non circuit private FHE scheme, with a homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme for a smaller class of circuits which is maliciously circuit-private. We devise the first known circuit private FHE, by instantiating our framework by various (standard) FHE schemes from the literature.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Rafail Ostrovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrovsky:Rafail", "Anat Paskin-Cherniavsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paskin=Cherniavsky:Anat", "Beni Paskin-Cherniavsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paskin=Cherniavsky:Beni"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2014", "pages": 18}
