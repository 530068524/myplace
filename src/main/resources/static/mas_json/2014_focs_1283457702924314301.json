That is, we give an explicit family of polynomials of degree d on N variables (with N = d3 in our case) with 0, 1-coefficients such that for any representation of a polynomial f in this family of the form f = \u03a3i \u220fj Qij, where the Qij's are homogeneous polynomials (recall that a polynomial is said to be homogeneous if all its monomials have the same degree), it must hold that \u2211i, j (Number of monomials of Qij)) \u22652\u03a9(\u221ad \u22c5log N). The above mentioned family, which we refer to as the Nisan-Wigderson design-based family of polynomials, is in the complexity class VNP. Our work builds on recent lower bound results [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] and yields an improved quantitative bound as compared to the quasi-polynomial lower bound from an earlier work of the same authors and the N\u03a9(log log N) lower bound in the independent work of [7].", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "authors": ["Neeraj Kayal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kayal:Neeraj", "Nutan Limaye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Limaye:Nutan", "Chandan Saha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saha_0001:Chandan", "Srikanth Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan_0001:Srikanth"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
