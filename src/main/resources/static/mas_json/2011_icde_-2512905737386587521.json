Compared with traditional keyword search, it is far more expensive to answer a keyword query over probabilistic XML data due to the consideration of possible world semantics. In this paper, we firstly define the new problem of studying top-k keyword search over probabilistic XML data, which is to retrieve k SLCA results with the k highest probabilities of existence. And then we propose two efficient algorithms. The first algorithm PrStack can find k SLCA results with the k highest probabilities by scanning the relevant keyword nodes only once. To further improve the efficiency, we propose a second algorithm EagerTopK based on a set of pruning properties which can quickly prune unsatisfied SLCA candidates. Finally, we implement the two algorithms and compare their performance with analysis of extensive experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "departments": ["Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Jianxin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianxin", "Chengfei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chengfei", "Rui Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Rui", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0011:Wei"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
