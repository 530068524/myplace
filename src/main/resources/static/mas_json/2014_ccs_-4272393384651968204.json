{"title": "Context-Based Zero-Interaction Pairing and Key Evolution for Advanced Personal Devices.", "fields": ["pairing", "security association", "internet of things", "wearable technology", "ambient noise level"], "abstract": "Solutions for pairing devices without prior security associations typically require users to actively take part in the pairing process of the devices. Scenarios involving new types of devices like Internet-of-Things (IoT) appliances and wearable devices make it, however, desirable to be able to pair users' personal devices without user involvement. In this paper, we present a new approach for secure zero-interaction pairing suitable for IoT and wearable devices.    We primarily require pairing to happen between \"correct\" devices -- the devices that the user intends to pair. Our pairing scheme identifies the correct devices based on measuring sustained co-presence over time. We do this by having the devices compute a fingerprint of their ambient context using information gathered through commonly available sensor modalities like ambient noise and luminosity. We introduce a novel robust and inexpensive approach for fingerprinting contexts over time. Co-present devices will observe roughly similar context fingerprints that we use in a key evolution protocol to gradually increase the confidence in the authenticity of the correct devices. Our experiments show the effectiveness of this approach for zero-interaction pairing.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "University of Helsinki", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Markus Miettinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miettinen:Markus", "N.
