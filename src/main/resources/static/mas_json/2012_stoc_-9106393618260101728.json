These are subsets of F n  of size |F| (1-e)n  whose intersection with any k-dimensional subspace is bounded by a constant c(k,e). This problem was raised by Guruswami (CCC 2011) as it leads to optimal rate list-decodable codes of constant list size. The main technical ingredient is the construction of k low-degree polynomials whose common set of zeros has small intersection with any k-dimensional subspace.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Zeev Dvir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dvir:Zeev", "Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar"], "pages": 8}
