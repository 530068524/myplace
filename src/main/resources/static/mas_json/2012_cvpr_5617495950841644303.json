We reconstruct the pose and motion of a character from a multi-view video sequence without requiring the cameras to be synchronized and without aligning captured frames in time. By formulating the model-to-image similarity measure as a temporally continuous functional, we are also able to reconstruct motion in much higher temporal detail than was possible with previous synchronized approaches. By purposefully running cameras unsynchronized we can capture even very fast motion at speeds that off-the-shelf but high quality cameras provide.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["MPI Informatik", "MPI Informatik", "MPI Informatik", "MPI Informatik", "MPI Informatik"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["A.
