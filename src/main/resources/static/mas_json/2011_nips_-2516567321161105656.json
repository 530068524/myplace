{"title": "On the Analysis of Multi-Channel Neural Spike Data.", "fields": ["hierarchical dirichlet process", "nonparametric statistics", "sorting", "feature learning", "spike sorting"], "abstract": "Nonparametric Bayesian methods are developed for analysis of multi-channel spike-train data, with the feature learning and spike sorting performed jointly. The feature learning and sorting are performed simultaneously across all channels. Dictionary learning is implemented via the beta-Bernoulli process, with spike sorting performed via the dynamic hierarchical Dirichlet process (dHDP), with these two models coupled. The dHDP is augmented to eliminate refractory-period violations, it allows the \"appearance\" and \"disappearance\" of neurons over time, and it models smooth variation in the spike statistics.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Bo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bo", "David E.
