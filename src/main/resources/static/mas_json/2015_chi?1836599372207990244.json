{"title": "Bootlegger: Turning Fans into Film Crew.", "fields": ["crew", "amateur", "metadata", "workflow", "user generated content"], "abstract": "Bootlegger is a system for creating multi-camera films of live music events using mobile devices. Using readily available technology and a synthesis of film-making conventions, the system coordinates music fans at live shows into an improvised film crew, suggesting shots, collating footage and generating rich metadata in real time. Bootlegger is part of a research project exploring adapting professional media workflows to amateur contexts in order to lower the bar to entry for media production. By enabling concert-goers to contribute to high-quality concert films, the system leverages mobile phone 'bootlegging' practices to support emerging musicians.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Guy Schofield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schofield:Guy", "Tom Bartindale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartindale:Tom", "Peter C.
