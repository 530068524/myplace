This relies on formal methods to ease the development of applications in an efficient and reusable way. Formal methods have been advocated as a means of increasing the reliability of systems, especially those which are safety or business critical. It is still difficult to develop automatic specification and verification tools due to limitations like state explosion, undecidability, etc. To face these problems, we provide LE with a constructive semantic that allows the modular compilation of programs into software and hardware targets (C code, VHDL code, FPGA synthesis, Verification tools). Moreover, we also provide software to design, compile and verify LE programs. Our approach is pertinent according to the two main requirements of critical realistic applications: the modular compilation allows us to deal with large systems, the model-driven approach provides us with formal validation.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Nice Sophia Antipolis", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Daniel Gaff\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaff=eacute=:Daniel", "Annie Ressouche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ressouche:Annie"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
