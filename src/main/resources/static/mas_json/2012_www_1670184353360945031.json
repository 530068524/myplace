{"title": "LINDEN: linking named entities with knowledge base via semantic knowledge.", "fields": ["open knowledge base connectivity", "weak entity", "semantic memory", "wordnet", "entity linking"], "abstract": "Integrating the extracted facts with an existing knowledge base has raised an urgent need to address the problem of entity linking. Specifically, entity linking is the task to link the entity mention in text with the corresponding real world entity in the existing knowledge base. However, this task is challenging due to name ambiguity, textual inconsistency, and lack of world knowledge in the knowledge base. Several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, but they are largely based on the co-occurrence statistics of terms between the text around the entity mention and the document associated with the entity. In this paper, we propose LINDEN, a novel framework to link named entities in text with a knowledge base unifying Wikipedia and WordNet, by leveraging the rich semantic knowledge embedded in the Wikipedia and the taxonomy of the knowledge base. We extensively evaluate the performance of our proposed LINDEN over two public data sets and empirical results show that LINDEN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (203)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Wei Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen_0004:Wei", "Jianyong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jianyong", "Ping Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0001:Ping", "Min Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Min"], "conf": "www", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
