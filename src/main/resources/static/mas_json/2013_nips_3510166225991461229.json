We also explore another factor affecting the search performance -margins of the partitions in these trees. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that large margin partitions can improve tree search performance.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Parikshit Ram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ram:Parikshit", "Alexander G.
