{"title": "Atomic Coherence: Leveraging nanophotonics to build race-free cache coherence protocols.", "fields": ["atomic coherence", "cache coherence", "low latency", "mesif protocol", "mesi protocol"], "abstract": "This paper advocates Atomic Coherence, a framework that simplifies cache coherence protocol specification, design, and verification by decoupling races from the protocol's operation. Atomic Coherence requires conflicting coherence requests to the same addresses be serialized with a mutex before they are issued. Once issued, requests follow a predictable race-free path. Because requests are guaranteed not to race, coherence protocols are simpler and protocol extensions are straightforward. Our implementation of Atomic Coherence uses optical mutexes because optics provides very low latency. We begin with a state-of-the-art non-atomic MOEFSI protocol and demonstrate that an atomic implementation is much simpler while imposing less than a 2% performance penalty. We then show how, in the absence of races, it is easy to add support for speculative coherence and improve performance by up to 70%. Similar performance gains may be possible in a non-atomic protocol, but not without considerable effort in race management.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Dana Vantrease.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vantrease:Dana", "Mikko H.
