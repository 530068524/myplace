The algorithm\u2019s task is to identify the target by adaptively querying vertices. In response to querying a node  q , the algorithm learns either that  q  is the target, or is given an edge out of  q  that lies on a shortest path from  q  to the target. We study this problem in a general noisy model in which each query independently receives a correct answer with probability  p  > 1/2 (a known constant), and an (adversarial) incorrect one with probability 1 \u2212  p .   Our main positive result is that when  p  = 1 (i.e., all answers are correct), log 2   n  queries are always sufficient. For general  p , we give an (almost information-theoretically optimal) algorithm that uses, in expectation, no more than (1 \u2212 \u03b4) log n /1 \u2212  H ( p ) +  o (log n ) +  O (log 2  (1/\u03b4)) queries, and identifies the target correctly with probability at leas 1 \u2212 \u03b4. Here,  H ( p ) = \u2212( p  log p  + (1 \u2212  p ) log(1 \u2212  p )) denotes the entropy. The first bound is achieved by the algorithm that iteratively queries a 1-median of the nodes not ruled out yet; the second bound by careful repeated invocations of a multiplicative weights algorithm.   Even for  p  = 1, we show several hardness results for the problem of determining whether a target can be found using  K  queries. Our upper bound of log 2   n  implies a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for undirected connected graphs; we show that this is best-possible under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Furthermore, for directed graphs, or for undirected graphs with non-uniform node querying costs, the problem is PSPACE-complete. For a semi-adaptive version, in which one may query  r  nodes each in  k  rounds, we show membership in \u03a3 2 k \u22121  in the polynomial hierarchy, and hardness for \u03a3 2 k \u22125 .", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ehsan Emamjomeh-Zadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emamjomeh=Zadeh:Ehsan", "David Kempe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kempe_0001:David", "Vikrant Singhal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singhal:Vikrant"], "pages": 14}
