To achieve this goal, we combine deep syntactic analysis and distributional semantics using a shortest path kernel method and soft clustering. The output of our system is a set of automatically discovered and ontologized semantic relations.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Dipartimento di ... a, Roma, Italy", "Dipartimento di ... a, Roma, Italy"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Andrea Moro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moro_0001:Andrea", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "pages": 7}
