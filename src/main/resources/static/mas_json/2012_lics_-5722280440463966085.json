This implies that there exists a tree generated by a second level collapsible pushdown system (equivalently: by a recursion scheme of second level), which is not generated by any deterministic higher order pushdown system (without collapse) of any level (equivalently: by any safe recursion scheme of any level). As a side effect, we present a pumping lemma for deterministic higher order pushdown automata, which potentially can be useful for other applications.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Pawel Parys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parys:Pawel"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
