Differently from previous approaches, that are confined to affine transformations on either the entire face or separate patches, we extract a nonrigid mapping between facial images. Based on a regularized face model, we frame unsupervised face alignment into the Lucas-Kanade image registration approach. We propose a robust optimization scheme to handle appearance variations. The method is fully automatic and can cope with pose variations and expressions, all in an unsupervised manner. Experiments on a large set of images showed that the approach is effective.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jianke Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jianke", "Luc J.
