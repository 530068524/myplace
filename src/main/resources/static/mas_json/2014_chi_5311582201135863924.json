The study quantifies and describes the thematic evolution of the field based on a total of 3152 CHI articles and their associated 16035 keywords published between 1994 and 2013. The analysis is conducted for two time periods (1994-2003, 2004-2013) and a comparison between them highlights the underlying trends in our community. More significantly, this study identifies the evolution of major themes in the discipline, and highlights individual topics as popular, core, or backbone research topics within HCI.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "\u00c5bo Akademi University", "University of Oulu"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yong", "Jorge Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Jorge", "Denzil Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Denzil", "Bei Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Bei", "Simo Hosio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosio:Simo", "Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis"], "pages": 10}
