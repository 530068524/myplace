We develop a shape-based object detection framework that works with limited texture and can robustly handle extreme illumination and occlusion issues. The contribution of this work is a purely geometric approach for detecting marker-like objects under difficult and realistic outdoor conditions. We demonstrate these techniques for mobile AR experiences by detecting and tracking star-shaped pentagrams embedded in the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 30Hz on a Nokia N900 phone.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Thommen Korah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korah:Thommen", "Jason Wither.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wither:Jason", "Yun-Ta Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Yun=Ta", "Ronald Azuma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azuma:Ronald"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
