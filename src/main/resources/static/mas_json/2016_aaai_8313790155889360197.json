We focus on the SNTV, Bloc, k-Borda, and Chamberlin\u2013Courant rules, as well as on approximate variants of the Chamberlin\u2013Courant rule, since the original rule is NP-hard to compute. We show that SHIFT BRIBERY tends to be significantly harder in the multiwinner setting than in the single-winner one by showing settings where SHIFT BRIBERY is easy in the single-winner cases, but is hard (and hard to approximate) in the multi-winner ones. We show that the non-monotonicity of those rules which are based on approximation algorithms for the Chamberlin\u2013Courant rule sometimes affects the complexity of SHIFT BRIBERY.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "AGH University of Science and Technology", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin"], "authors": ["Robert Bredereck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bredereck:Robert", "Piotr Faliszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faliszewski:Piotr", "Rolf Niedermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niedermeier:Rolf", "Nimrod Talmon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talmon:Nimrod"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
