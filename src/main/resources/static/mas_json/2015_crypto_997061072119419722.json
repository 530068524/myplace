Their construction has since been lauded for its simplicity, yet also criticized for not providing the same security as other block ciphers against generic attacks. In this paper, we prove that if a small number of plaintexts are encrypted under multiple independent keys, the Even-Mansour construction surprisingly offers similar security as an ideal block cipher with the same block and key size. Note that this multi-key setting is of high practical relevance, as real-world implementations often allow frequent rekeying. We hope that the results in this paper will further encourage the use of the Even-Mansour construction, especially when a secure and efficient implementation of a key schedule would result in significant overhead.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Nicky Mouha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mouha:Nicky", "Atul Luykx.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luykx:Atul"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
