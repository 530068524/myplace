{"title": "A systematic approach to using music for mitigating affective effects on driving performance and safety.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "affect", "computer science"], "abstract": "Research has shown that affective effects on driving performance and safety are as dangerous as (or even more dangerous than) effects of the secondary tasks [11]. There has been some research on the use of speech-based systems for the intervention, but little research on the use of music has attempted to mitigate a driver's affective states while driving. The current paper identifies various taxonomies of the effects of music and explores plausible research variables, considerations, and practical application directions.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Michigan Technological University"], "authors": ["Myounghoon Jeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeon:Myounghoon"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 6}
