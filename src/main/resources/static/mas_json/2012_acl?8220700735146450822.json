This deficiency provokes attachment errors in the parsers trained on such data. We propose in this paper to compute lexical affinities, on large corpora, for specific lexico-syntactic configurations that are hard to disambiguate and introduce the new information in a parser. Experiments on the French Treebank showed a relative decrease of the error rate of 7.1% Labeled Accuracy Score yielding the best parsing results on this treebank.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Sharif University of Technology", "Aix-Marseille University", "University of Paris"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirroshandel:Seyed_Abolghasem", "Alexis Nasr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nasr:Alexis", "Joseph Le Roux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roux:Joseph_Le"], "pages": 9}
