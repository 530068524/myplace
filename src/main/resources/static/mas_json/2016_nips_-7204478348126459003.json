SON is an enhanced version of the Online Newton Step, which, via sketching techniques enjoys a running time linear in the dimension and sketch size. We further develop sparse forms of the sketching methods (such as Oja's rule), making the computation linear in the sparsity of features. Together, the algorithm eliminates all computational obstacles in previous second order online learning approaches.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Microsoft", "University of Milan", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Haipeng Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Haipeng", "Alekh Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Alekh", "Nicol\u00f2 Cesa-Bianchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cesa=Bianchi:Nicol=ograve=", "John Langford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langford_0001:John"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
