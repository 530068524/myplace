While most aspects of conversational speech have benefited from a wide availability of analytic, computationally tractable techniques, only qualitative assessments are available for characterizing multi-party turn-taking. The current paper attempts to address this deficiency by first proposing a framework for computing turn-taking model perplexity, and then by evaluating several multi-participant modeling approaches. Experiments show that direct multi-participant models do not generalize to held out data, and likely never will, for practical reasons. In contrast, the Extended-Degree-of-Overlap model represents a suitable candidate for future work in this area, and is shown to successfully predict the distribution of speech in time and across participants in previously unseen conversations.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kornel Laskowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laskowski:Kornel"], "pages": 10}
