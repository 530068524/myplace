In this paper, we propose an approach called evolutionary hierarchical Dirichlet processes (EvoHDP) to discover interesting cluster evolution patterns from such text data. We formulate the EvoHDP as a series of hierarchical Dirichlet processes~(HDP) by adding time dependencies to the adjacent epochs, and propose a cascaded Gibbs sampling scheme to infer the model. This approach can discover different evolving patterns of clusters, including emergence, disappearance, evolution within a corpus and across different corpora. Experiments over synthetic and real-world multiple correlated time-varying data sets illustrate the effectiveness of EvoHDP on discovering cluster evolution patterns.", "citation": "Citations (121)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "IBM", "Tsinghua University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Jianwen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jianwen", "Yangqiu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yangqiu", "Changshui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changshui", "Shixia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shixia"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
