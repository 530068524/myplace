However, multilabeling problems are usually very challenging to solve, especially when some ordering constraints are enforced. We solve in this paper a five-parts labeling problem proposed in [6, 7]. In this model, one wants to find an optimal labeling for an image with five possible parts: \u201cleft\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201ctop\u201d, \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201ccenter\u201d. The geometric ordering constraints can be read naturally from the names. No previous method can solve the problem with globally optimal solutions in a linear space complexity. We propose an efficient dynamic programming based algorithm which guarantees the global optimal labeling for the five-parts model. The time complexity is O(N 1.5 ) and the space complexity is O(N), with N being the number of pixels in the image. In practice, it runs faster than previous methods. Moreover, it works for both 4-neighborhood and 8-neighborhood settings, and can be easily parallelized for GPU.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Iowa", "University of Iowa", "University of Western Ontario", "University of Iowa"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Junjie Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Junjie", "Qi Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Qi", "Olga Veksler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veksler:Olga", "Xiaodong Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xiaodong"], "pages": 8}
