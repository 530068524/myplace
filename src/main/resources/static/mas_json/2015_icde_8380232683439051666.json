Most of the existing algorithms, however, are designed for the distributed-memory setting or the external-memory setting, and cannot take full advantage of a multicore machine, whose capacity has grown to accommodate even the largest of real-world graphs.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Mahidol University International College"], "authors": ["Julian Shun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shun:Julian", "Kanat Tangwongsan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tangwongsan:Kanat"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
