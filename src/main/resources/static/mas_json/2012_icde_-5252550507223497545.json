{"title": "Earlybird: Real-Time Search at Twitter.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "inverted index", "real time search", "concurrency", "low latency"], "abstract": "The web today is increasingly characterized by social and real-time signals, which we believe represent two frontiers in information retrieval. In this paper, we present Early bird, the core retrieval engine that powers Twitter's real-time search service. Although Early bird builds and maintains inverted indexes like nearly all modern retrieval engines, its index structures differ from those built to support traditional web search. We describe these differences and present the rationale behind our design. A key requirement of real-time search is the ability to ingest content rapidly and make it searchable immediately, while concurrently supporting low-latency, high-throughput query evaluation. These demands are met with a single-writer, multiple-reader concurrency model and the targeted use of memory barriers. Early bird represents a point in the design space of real-time search engines that has worked well for Twitter's needs. By sharing our experiences, we hope to spur additional interest and innovation in this exciting space.", "citation": "Citations (167)", "departments": ["Twitter", "Twitter"], "authors": ["Michael Busch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Busch:Michael", "Krishna Gade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gade:Krishna", "Brian Larson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larson:Brian", "Patrick Lok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lok:Patrick", "Samuel Luckenbill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luckenbill:Samuel", "Jimmy J.
