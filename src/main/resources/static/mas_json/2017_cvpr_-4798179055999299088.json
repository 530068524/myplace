In addition to generating simple and geometrically interpretable explanations of 3D objects, our framework also allows us to automatically discover and exploit consistent structure in the data. We demonstrate that using our method allows predicting shape representations which can be leveraged for obtaining a consistent parsing across the instances of a shape collection and constructing an interpretable shape similarity measure. We also examine applications for image-based prediction as well as shape manipulation.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shubham Tulsiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tulsiani:Shubham", "Hao Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Hao", "Leonidas J.
