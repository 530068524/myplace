Several routing protocols have been proposed to improve the packet delivery rate based on enhanced metrics that capture the wireless link quality. However, these metrics do not take into account that some participants can exhibit selfish behavior by selectively dropping packets sent by other mesh routers in order to prioritize their own traffic and increase their network utilization.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Purdue University", "University of Bergamo", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Stefano Paris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paris:Stefano", "Cristina Nita-Rotaru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nita=Rotaru:Cristina", "Fabio Martignon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martignon:Fabio", "Antonio Capone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capone:Antonio"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
