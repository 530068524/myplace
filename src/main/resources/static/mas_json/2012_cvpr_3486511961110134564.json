{"title": "Parsing clothing in fashion photographs.", "fields": ["image retrieval", "effective method", "pose", "clothing", "parsing"], "abstract": "In this paper we demonstrate an effective method for parsing clothing in fashion photographs, an extremely challenging problem due to the large number of possible garment items, variations in configuration, garment appearance, layering, and occlusion. In addition, we provide a large novel dataset and tools for labeling garment items, to enable future research on clothing estimation. Finally, we present intriguing initial results on using clothing estimates to improve pose identification, and demonstrate a prototype application for pose-independent visual garment retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (275)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kota Yamaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamaguchi:Kota", "M.
