{"title": "Online matching: haste makes waste!", "fields": ["matching", "complete graph", "k server problem", "triangle inequality", "competitive analysis"], "abstract": "This paper studies a new online problem, referred to as  min-cost perfect matching with delays (MPMD) , defined over a finite metric space (i.e., a complete graph with positive edge weights obeying the triangle inequality)  M  that is known to the algorithm in advance. Requests arrive in a continuous time online fashion at the points of  M  and should be served by matching them to each other. The algorithm is allowed to delay its request matching commitments, but this does not come for free: the total cost of the algorithm is the sum of metric distances between matched requests  plus  the sum of times each request waited since it arrived until it was matched. A randomized online MPMD algorithm is presented whose competitive ratio is  O  (log 2   n  + log\u0394), where  n  is the number of points in  M  and \u0394 is its aspect ratio. The analysis is based on a machinery developed in the context of a new stochastic process that can be viewed as two interleaved Poisson processes; surprisingly, this new process captures precisely the behavior of our algorithm. A related problem in which the algorithm is allowed to clear any unmatched request at a fixed penalty is also addressed. It is suggested that the MPMD problem is merely the tip of the iceberg for a general framework of online problems with delayed service that captures many more natural problems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yuval Emek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emek:Yuval", "Shay Kutten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kutten:Shay", "Roger Wattenhofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wattenhofer:Roger"], "pages": 12}
