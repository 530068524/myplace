QoSoDoS ensures timely delivery of time sensitive messages over unreliable network, susceptible to high congestion and network flooding DoS attacks. QoSoDoS is based on scheduling multiple transmissions of packets while attempting to minimize overhead and load, and avoiding self-creation of DoS. We present a model and initial empirical results of QoSoDoS implementation. Our results show that under typical scenarios, QoSoDoS can handle high congestion and DoS attacks quite well.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University"], "authors": ["Moti Geva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geva:Moti", "Amir Herzberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herzberg:Amir"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
