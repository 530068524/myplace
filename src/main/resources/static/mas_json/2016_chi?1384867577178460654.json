{"title": "Influence of Content Layout and Motivation on Users' Herd Behavior in Social Discovery.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "knowledge management", "herd behavior", "situated", "herd"], "abstract": "Social product discovery is an emerging paradigm that enables users to seek information and inspiration from peer-contributed contents. Researchers have observed herd behaviors in social discovery, i.e., basing beliefs and decisions on what similarly situated others have done. In this paper, we explore the effects of content layout and motivation on users' herd behaviors in social discovery. We conduct an eye-tracking study with 120 participants to compare goal- and action-oriented users' behaviors on a grid versus waterfall style social discovery site. The results show that users have a higher tendency to herd on a grid-style website, more so for goal-oriented users.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yanzhen Yue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yue:Yanzhen", "Xiaojuan Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaojuan", "Zhenhui Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Zhenhui"], "pages": 5}
