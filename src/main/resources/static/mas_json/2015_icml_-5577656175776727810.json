Instead it trains directly on monolingual data and extracts a bilingual signal from a smaller set of raw-text sentence-aligned data. This is achieved using a novel sampled bag-of-words cross-lingual objective, which is used to regularize two noise-contrastive language models for efficient cross-lingual feature learning. We show that bilingual embeddings learned using the proposed model outperform state-of-the-art methods on a cross-lingual document classification task as well as a lexical translation task on WMT11 data.", "citation": "Citations (164)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Google", "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Stephan Gouws.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gouws:Stephan", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua", "Greg Corrado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corrado:Greg"], "pages": 9}
