However, there is no knowledge on the key-dependent capacity and data complexity so far. Their values were assumed to be close to the average value for a vast majority of keys. This assumption is not accurate. In this paper, under a reasonable condition, we explicitly formulate the capacity as a Gamma distribution and the data complexity as an Inverse Gamma distribution, in terms of the average linear probability and the dimension. The capacity distribution is experimentally verified on the 5-round PRESENT.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Aalto University"], "authors": ["Jialin Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jialin", "Serge Vaudenay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaudenay:Serge", "Xuejia Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Xuejia", "Kaisa Nyberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nyberg:Kaisa"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
