{"title": "Event Extraction via Dynamic Multi-Pooling Convolutional Neural Networks.", "fields": ["deep learning", "machine learning", "sentence", "convolutional neural network", "pooling"], "abstract": "Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event extraction primarily rely on elaborately designed features and complicated natural language processing (NLP) tools. These traditional approaches lack generalization, take a large amount of human effort and are prone to error propagation and data sparsity problems. This paper proposes a novel event-extraction method, which aims to automatically extract lexical-level and sentence-level features without using complicated NLP tools. We introduce a word-representation model to capture meaningful semantic regularities for words and adopt a framework based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture sentence-level clues. However, CNN can only capture the most important information in a sentence and may miss valuable facts when considering multiple-event sentences. We propose a dynamic multi-pooling convolutional neural network (DMCNN), which uses a dynamic multi-pooling layer according to event triggers and arguments, to reserve more crucial information. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yubo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Yubo", "Liheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Liheng", "Kang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Kang", "Daojian Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Daojian", "Jun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Jun"], "pages": 10}
