Our generative model is an n node multilayer network that has degree at most n\u03b3 for some \u03b3 < 1 and each edge has a random edge weight in [-1, 1]. Our algorithm learns almost all networks in this class with polynomial running time. The sample complexity is quadratic or cubic depending upon the details of the model.\n\nThe algorithm uses layerwise learning. It is based upon a novel idea of observing correlations among features and using these to infer the underlying edge structure via a global graph recovery procedure. The analysis of the algorithm reveals interesting structure of neural nets with random edge weights.", "citation": "Citations (196)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Google", "Microsoft", "Princeton University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Sanjeev Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Sanjeev", "Aditya Bhaskara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhaskara:Aditya", "Rong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge_0001:Rong", "Tengyu Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Tengyu"], "pages": 9}
