{"title": "Brahmastra: Driving Apps to Test the Security of Third-Party Components.", "fields": ["rewriting", "personally identifiable information", "use case", "graphical user interface testing", "access token"], "abstract": "We present an app automation tool called Brahmastra for helping app stores and security researchers to test third-party components in mobile apps at runtime. The main challenge is that call sites that invoke third-party code may be deeply embedded in the app, beyond the reach of traditional GUI testing tools. Our approach uses static analysis to construct a page transition graph and discover execution paths to invoke third-party code. We then perform binary rewriting to \"jump start\" the third-party code by following the execution path, efficiently pruning out undesired executions. Compared with the state-of-the-art GUI testing tools, Brahmastra is able to successfully analyse third-party code in 2.7\u00d7 more apps and decrease test duration by a factor of 7. We use Brahmastra to uncover interesting results for two use cases: 175 out of 220 children's apps we tested display ads that point to web pages that attempt to collect personal information, which is a potential violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA); and 13 of the 200 apps with the Facebook SDK that we tested are vulnerable to a known access token attack.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of California, Riverside", "Microsoft"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Ravi Bhoraskar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhoraskar:Ravi", "Seungyeop Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Seungyeop", "Jinseong Jeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeon:Jinseong", "Tanzirul Azim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azim:Tanzirul", "Shuo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Shuo", "Jaeyeon Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Jaeyeon", "Suman Nath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nath:Suman", "Rui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0010:Rui", "David Wetherall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wetherall:David"], "pages": 16}
