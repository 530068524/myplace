We derive a quadratic formula by analyzing the kinematics of the gripping hand. Model fit is high for the thumb-motion trajectories of 20 participants. The model predicts the functional area for a given 1) surface size, 2) hand size, and 3) position of the index finger on the back of the device. Designers can use this model to ensure that a user interface is suitable for interaction with the thumb. The model can also be used inversely - that is, to infer the grips assumed by a given user interface layout.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Joanna Bergstrom-Lehtovirta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergstrom=Lehtovirta:Joanna", "Antti Oulasvirta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oulasvirta:Antti"], "pages": 10}
