{"title": "A Scalable Approach to Probabilistic Latent Space Inference of Large-Scale Networks.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "vertex", "scalability", "inference", "statistical model"], "abstract": "We propose a scalable approach for making inference about latent spaces of large networks. With a succinct representation of networks as a bag of triangular motifs, a parsimonious statistical model, and an efficient stochastic variational inference algorithm, we are able to analyze real networks with over a million vertices and hundreds of latent roles on a single machine in a matter of hours, a setting that is out of reach for many existing methods. When compared to the state-of-the-art probabilistic approaches, our method is several orders of magnitude faster, with competitive or improved accuracy for latent space recovery and link prediction.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Junming Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Junming", "Qirong Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Qirong", "Eric P.
