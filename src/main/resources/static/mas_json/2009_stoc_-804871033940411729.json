As linear-sized spectral sparsifiers of complete graphs are expanders, our sparsifiers of arbitrary graphs can be viewed as generalizations of expander graphs. In particular, we prove that for every d > 1 and every undirected, weighted graph G = (V,E,w) on n vertices, there exists a weighted graph H=(V,F,~{w}) with at most \u2308d(n-1)\u2309 edges such that for every x \u2208 R V , [x T  L G  x \u2264 x T  L H  x \u2264 ((d+1+2\u221ad)/(d+1-2\u221ad)) \u2022 x T  L G  x] where L G  and L H  are the Laplacian matrices of G and H, respectively. Thus, H approximates G spectrally at least as well as a Ramanujan expander with dn/2 edges approximates the complete graph. We give an elementary deterministic polynomial time algorithm for constructing H.", "citation": "Citations (216)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Yale University", "Yale University"], "authors": ["Joshua D.
