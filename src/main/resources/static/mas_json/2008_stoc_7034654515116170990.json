[9]. We show that this simple framework can be used to design combinatorial algorithms that achieve O(log n) approximation factor and whose running time is dominated by a poly-logarithmic number of single-commodity max-flow computations. This matches the performance of the algorithm of Arora and Kale [2]. Moreover, we also show that it is impossible to get an approximation factor of better than \u03a9(\u221alog n) in the cut-matching game framework. These results suggest that the simple and concrete abstraction of the cut-matching game may be powerful enough to capture the essential features of the complexity of Sparsest Cut.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "California Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "IBM"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Lorenzo Orecchia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orecchia:Lorenzo", "Leonard J.
