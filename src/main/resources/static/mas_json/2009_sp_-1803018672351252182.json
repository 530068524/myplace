{"title": "Fingerprinting Blank Paper Using Commodity Scanners.", "fields": ["world wide web", "physical security", "commodity", "secrecy", "compromise", "computer science", "blank", "counterfeit"], "abstract": "We develop a novel technique for authenticating physical documents by using random, naturally occurring imperfections in paper texture. To this end, we devised a new method for measuring the three-dimensional surface of a paper without modifying the document in any way, using only a commodity scanner. From this physical feature, we generate a concise fingerprint that uniquely identifies the document. Our method is secure against counterfeiting, robust to harsh handling, and applicable even before any content is printed on a page. It has a wide range of applications, including detecting forged currency and tickets, authenticating passports, and halting counterfeit goods. On a more sinister note, document identification could be used to de-anonymize printed surveys and to compromise the secrecy of paper ballots.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Electrical Engi ... and Engineering"], "authors": ["William Clarkson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clarkson:William", "Tim Weyrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weyrich:Tim", "Adam Finkelstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finkelstein:Adam", "Nadia Heninger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heninger:Nadia", "J.
