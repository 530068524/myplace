{"title": "An Efficient Filter-based Addressing Protocol for Autoconfiguration of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks.", "fields": ["mobile ad hoc network", "merge", "distributive property", "hash function", "low latency"], "abstract": "the network and the detection of address collisions after the merging of several partitions. With the filters, any node can check if an address is available before trying to allocate it. Also, a node can check if the hash of its filter is the same of the hash of the filter of its neighbors, to identify partitions. Therefore, the filters reduce the control overhead and allow an accurate detection of partition mergings. This is important because the higher the control overhead, the less the lifetime of nodes and the less the available bandwidth to send data. The procedures of FAP assure the correct update of states in each node in a distributive way with no address collisions. The analysis and the simulation experiments show that FAP achieves low complexity, low storage, low communication overhead and low latency, resolving address collisions in a timely manner. The paper is structured as follows. Related research efforts concerning addressing in ad hoc networks are introduced in Section II. The proposed protocol is detailed in Section III and the performance of FAP is analytically evaluated in Section IV. Besides, we performed a simulation described in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["GTA/COPPE, Univ ...  Rio de Janeiro", "GTA/COPPE, Univ ...  Rio de Janeiro", "GTA/COPPE, Univ ...
