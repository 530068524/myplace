We first relate CRFs and structured SVMs and show that in CRFs a variant of the log-partition function, known as the soft-max, smoothly approximates the hinge loss function of structured SVMs. We then propose an intuitive approximation for the structured prediction problem, using duality, based on a local entropy approximation and derive an efficient message-passing algorithm that is guaranteed to converge. Unlike existing approaches, this allows us to learn efficiently graphical models with cycles and very large number of parameters.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["TTI Chicago", "TTI Chicago"], "authors": ["Tamir Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Tamir", "Raquel Urtasun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urtasun:Raquel"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
