The analysis shows that for these classes an incremental, globally consistent, locally conservative, set-driven learner always exists. Additionally, the analysis provides a recipe for constructing new learnable classes. Potential applications include learnable models for aspects of natural language and cognition.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Delaware", "University of Delaware"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heinz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinz:Jeffrey"], "pages": 10}
