{"title": "Object-Relational Queries over CFDI", "fields": ["monad", "schema", "data access", "description logic", "sql"], "abstract": "We consider how SQL-like query languages over object-relational schemata can be preserved in the setting of ontology based data access (OBDA), thus leveraging wide familiarity with relational technology. This is enabled by the adoption of the logic CFDInc\u2200-, a member of the CFD family of description logics (DLs). Of particular note is that this logic can fully simulate DL-LitecoreF, a member of the DL-Lite family commonly used in the OBDA setting. Our main results present efficient algorithms that allow computation of certain answers with respect to CFDInc\u2200- knowledge bases, facilitating direct access to a pre-existing row-based relational encoding of the data without any need for mappings to triple-based representations.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jason St. Jacques.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacques:Jason_St=", "David Toman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toman:David", "Grant E.
