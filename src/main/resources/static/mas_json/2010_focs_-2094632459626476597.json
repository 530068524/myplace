A few works have suggested studying the complexity of generating\u2014or sampling\u2014the distribution $h(x)$ for uniform $x$, given random bits. We further advocate this study, with a new emphasis on lower bounds for restricted computational models. Our main results are the following: (1) Any function $f : \\{0, 1\\}^\\ell \\to \\{0, 1\\}^n$ such that (i) each output bit $f_i$ depends on $o(\\log n)$ input bits, and (ii) $\\ell \\le \\log_2 \\binom{n}{\\alpha n} + n^{0.99}$ has output distribution $f(U)$ at statistical distance $\\ge 1 - 1/n^{0.49}$ from the uniform distribution over $n$-bit strings of hamming weight $\\alpha n$. We also prove lower bounds for generating $(X,b(X))$ for Boolean $b$, and in the case in which each bit $f_i$ is a small-depth decision tree. These lower bounds seem to be the first of their kind; the proofs use anticoncentration results for the sum of random variables. (2) Lower bounds for succinct data structures. As a corollary of (1), we obtain the first lower bound for the membership problem of representing a set $S \\subseteq [n]$ of size $\\alpha n$, in the case where $1/\\alpha$ is a power of $2$: If queries \u201c$i \\in S$?\u201d are answered by nonadaptively probing $o(\\log n)$ bits, then the representation uses $\\ge \\log_2 \\binom{n}{\\alpha n} + \\Omega(\\log n)$ bits. (3) Upper bounds complementing the bounds in (1) for various settings of parameters. (4) Uniform randomized $\\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits of $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ size and depth $d = O(1)$ with error $\\epsilon$ can be simulated by uniform randomized $\\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits of $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ size and depth $d+1$ with error $\\epsilon + o(1)$ using $\\le (\\log n)^{O( \\log \\log n)}$ random bits.
