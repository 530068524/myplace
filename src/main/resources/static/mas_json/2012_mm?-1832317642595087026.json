Dinner of Luciernaga is an interdisciplinary project produced by more than ten talented members which include the director, dancer, choreographer, artist, interactive designer, sound designer, iPhone app engineer, image processing designer, stage designer and light designer. The goal of this project is to create new modes of interactive participation between the performers and audience through the use of an innovative iPhone application that links dancer to audience and audience to dancer.
