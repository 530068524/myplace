{"title": "When TEDDY meets GrizzLY: temporal dependency discovery for triggering road deicing operations.", "fields": ["data mining", "computer science", "wireless sensor network"], "abstract": "Temporal dependencies between multiple sensor data sources link two types of events if the occurrence of one is repeatedly followed by the appearance of the other in a certain time interval. TEDDY algorithm aims at discovering such dependencies, identifying the statically significant time intervals with a chi2 test. We present how these dependencies can be used within the GrizzLY project to tackle an environmental and technical issue: the deicing of the roads. This project aims to wisely organize the deicing operations of an urban area, based on several sensor network measures of local atmospheric phenomena. A spatial and temporal dependency-based model is built from these data to predict freezing alerts.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Institut national des sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon", "Institut national des sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon", "University of Lyon", "HiKoB, Villeurbanne, France"], "authors": ["C\u00e9line Robardet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robardet:C=eacute=line", "Vasile-Marian Scuturici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scuturici:Vasile=Marian", "Marc Plantevit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plantevit:Marc", "Antoine Fraboulet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fraboulet:Antoine"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
