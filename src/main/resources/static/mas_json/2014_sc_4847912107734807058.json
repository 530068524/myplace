{"title": "Structure Slicing: Extending Logical Regions with Fields.", "fields": ["slicing", "programmer", "abstraction", "program slicing", "task parallelism"], "abstract": "Applications on modern supercomputers are increasingly limited by the cost of data movement, but mainstream programming systems have few abstractions for describing the structure of a program's data. Consequently, the burden of managing data movement, placement, and layout currently falls primarily upon the programmer.   To address this problem we previously proposed a data model based on  logical regions  and described Legion, a programming system incorporating logical regions. In this paper, we present  structure slicing , which incorporates  fields  into the logical region data model. We show that structure slicing enables Legion to automatically infer task parallelism from field non-interference, decouple the specification of data usage from layout, and reduce the overall amount of data moved. We demonstrate that structure slicing enables both strong and weak scaling of three Legion applications including S3D, a production combustion simulation that uses logical regions with thousands of fields, with speedups of up to 3.68X over a vectorized CPU-only Fortran implementation and 1.88X over an independently hand-tuned OpenACC code.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Michael Bauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauer:Michael", "Sean Treichler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Treichler:Sean", "Elliott Slaughter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slaughter:Elliott", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
