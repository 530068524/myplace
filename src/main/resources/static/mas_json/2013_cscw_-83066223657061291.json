This paper presents a case study of one strategy Etsy, one such online creative community, uses to articulate the creative dispositions of the community's exemplar members: Featured Seller interviews. For this study, we report on a combined content analysis and close reading of Featured Seller interviews on Etsy.com, followed up with member check interviews. Our analysis highlights the demographics of featured sellers, the ways in they express their identities and creative processes, and how they position themselves within the broader Etsy community. Our findings demonstrate that Etsy's administrators provide both a platform and scaffolding for community leaders to co-articulate with them the creative ideals they believe will strengthen the bonds of the Etsy community.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Tyler Pace.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pace:Tyler", "Katie O'Donnell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Donnell:Katie", "Natalie DeWitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeWitt:Natalie", "Shaowen Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Shaowen", "Jeffrey Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Jeffrey"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
