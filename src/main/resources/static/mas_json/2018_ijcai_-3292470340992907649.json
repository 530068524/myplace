This paper explores three important and interrelated themes in social network theory: the center/periphery partition of the network; network dynamics; and social integration of newcomers. We tackle the question: How would a newcomer harness information brokerage to integrate into a dynamic network going from periphery to center? We model integration as the interplay between the newcomer and the dynamics network and capture information brokerage using a process of relationship building. We analyze theoretical guarantees for the newcomer to reach the center through tactics; proving that a winning tactic always exists for certain types of network dynamics. We then propose three tactics and show their superior performance over alternative methods on four real-world datasets and four network models. In general, our tactics place the newcomer to the center by adding very few new edges on dynamic networks with approximately 14000 nodes.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "University of Auckland", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Bo Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Bo", "Yiping Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yiping", "Jiamou Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jiamou", "Yijin Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Yijin", "Hongyi Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Hongyi", "Hong Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Hong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
