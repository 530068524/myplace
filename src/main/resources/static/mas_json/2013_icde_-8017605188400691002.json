We argue that knowledge about attributes (of concepts or entities) plays a critical role in inferencing. In this paper, we propose methods to derive attributes for millions of concepts and we quantify the typicality of the attributes with regard to their corresponding concepts. We employ multiple data sources such as web documents, search logs, and existing knowledge bases, and we derive typicality scores for attributes by aggregating different distributions derived from different sources using different methods. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach to integrate concept- and instance-based patterns into probabilistic typicality scores that scale to broad concept space. We have conducted extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Renmin University of China", "Microsoft", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Taesung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Taesung", "Zhongyuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhongyuan", "Haixun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haixun", "Seung-won Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Seung=won"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
