However, our understanding of how to actually build secure iO remains in its infancy. While many candidate constructions have been published, some have been broken, and it is unclear which of the remaining candidates are secure.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Prabhanjan Ananth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ananth:Prabhanjan", "Aayush Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Aayush", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit"], "pages": 31}
