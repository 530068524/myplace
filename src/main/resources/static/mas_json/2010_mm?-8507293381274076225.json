We first use the adaptive mean shift algorithm to extract superpixels from the input image, then apply Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster superpixels based on their color similarity, and finally calculate the saliency value for each cluster using compactness metric together with modified PageRank propagation. This solution is able to represent the image in a perceptually meaningful way and is robust to over-segmentation. It highlights salient regions with full resolution, well-defined boundary. Experimental results show that both the adaptive mean shift and the modified PageRank algorithm contribute substantially to the saliency detection result. In addition, the ROC analysis demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms five existing popular methods.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Zhixiang Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Zhixiang", "Yiqun Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yiqun", "Liang-Tien Chia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chia:Liang=Tien", "Deepu Rajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajan:Deepu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
