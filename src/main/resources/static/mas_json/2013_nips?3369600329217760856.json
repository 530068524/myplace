Unfortunately, such models are difficult to train because inference over latent variables must be performed concurrently with parameter optimization\u2014creating a highly non-convex problem. Instead of proposing another local training method, we develop a convex relaxation of hidden-layer conditional models that admits global training. Our approach extends current convex modeling approaches to handle two nested nonlinearities separated by a non-trivial adaptive latent layer. The resulting methods are able to acquire two-layer models that cannot be represented by any single-layer model over the same features, while improving training quality over local heuristics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "Australian National University", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["\u00d6zlem Aslan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aslan:=Ouml=zlem", "Hao Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Hao", "Xinhua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinhua", "Dale Schuurmans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuurmans:Dale"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
