We provide, for the first time, an efficient algorithm that is able to realize this upper bound, and we empirically demonstrate its good performance.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Christopher Tosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tosh:Christopher", "Sanjoy Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Sanjoy"], "pages": 9}
