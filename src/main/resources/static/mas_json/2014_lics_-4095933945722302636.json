We study the time complexity of deciding graph properties definable by first-order sentences in prenex normal form with  k  variables. The trivial algorithm for this problem runs in  O ( n   k  ) time on  n -node graphs (the big-O hides the dependence on  k ).   Answering a question of Miklos Ajtai, we give the first algorithms running faster than the trivial algorithm, in the general case of arbitrary first-order sentences and arbitrary graphs. One algorithm runs in  O ( n   k -3+ \u03c9  ) \u2264  O ( n   k -0.627 ) time for all  k  \u2265 3, where  \u03c9   n  x  n  matrix multiplication exponent. By applying fast rectangular matrix multiplication, the algorithm can be improved further to run in  n   k -1+ o (1)  time, for all  k  \u2265 9. Finally, we observe that the exponent of  k  - 1 is optimal, under the popular hypothesis that CNF satisfiability with  n  variables and  m  clauses cannot be solved in (2 - e)  n   \u00b7 poly( m ) time for some e > 0.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Stanford University"], "authors": ["Ryan Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams_0001:Ryan"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 6}
