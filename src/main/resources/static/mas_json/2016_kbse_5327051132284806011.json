Recently, a new paradigm has emerged: filtered software product line engineering transfers the established check-out/modify/commit workflow from version control to variability management, allowing to iteratively develop the multi-variant model in a single-variant view. This paper demonstrates  SuperMod , a tool that supports collaborative filtered model-driven product line engineering, implemented for and with the Eclipse Modeling Framework. Concerning variability management, the tool offers capabilities for editing feature models and specifying feature configurations, both being well-known formalisms in product line engineering. Furthermore, collaborative editing of product lines is provided through distributed version control. The accompanying video shows that SuperMod seamlessly integrates into existing tool landscapes, reduces the complexity of multi-variant editing, automates a large part of variability management, and ensures consistency.
