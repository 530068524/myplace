{"title": "gRegress: Extracting Features from Graph Transactions for Regression.", "fields": ["subgraph isomorphism problem", "induced subgraph isomorphism problem", "speedup", "factor critical graph", "order of magnitude"], "abstract": "In this work we propose gRegress, a new algorithm which given set a of labeled graphs and a real value associated with each graph extracts the complete set of subgraphs such that a) each subgraph in this set has correlation with the real value above a user-specified threshold and b) each subgraph in this set has correlation with any other subgraph in the set below a user-specified threshold. gRegress incorporates novel pruning mechanisms based on correlation of a subgraph feature with the output and correlation with other subgraph features. These pruning mechanisms lead to significant speedup.\n\nExperimental results indicate that in terms of run-time, gRegress substantially outperforms gSpan, often by an order of magnitude while the regression models produced by both approaches have comparable accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Washington State University", "Washington State University", "Washington State University"], "authors": ["Nikhil S.
