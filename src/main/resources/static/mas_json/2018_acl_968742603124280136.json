We test this method on a highly parallel corpus and learn semantic representations of words in 1259 different languages in a single common space. An extensive experimental evaluation on crosslingual word similarity and sentiment analysis indicates that concept-based multilingual embedding learning performs better than previous approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Roi Reichart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reichart:Roi", "Anna Korhonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korhonen:Anna", "Ivan Vulic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vulic:Ivan", "Edoardo Maria Ponti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponti:Edoardo_Maria"], "pages": 12}
