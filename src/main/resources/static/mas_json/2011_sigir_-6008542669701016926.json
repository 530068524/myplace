These measures are often formulated as a sum over the product of a discount function of ranks and a gain function mapping relevance assessments to numeric utility values. We develop a conceptual framework for analyzing such effectiveness measures based on classifying members of this broad family of measures into four distinct families, each of which reflects a different notion of system utility. Within this framework we can hypothesize about the properties that such a measure should have and test those hypotheses against user and system data. Along the way we present a collection of novel results about specific measures and relationships between them.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["University of Delaware"], "authors": ["Ben Carterette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carterette:Ben"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
