It has broad applications in vision, graphics, and robotics. Our study indicates that the widely-used generative adversarial network (GAN) may learn \"incomplete\" representations due to the single-pathway framework: an encoder-decoder network followed by a discriminator network. We propose CR-GAN to address this problem. In addition to the single reconstruction path, we introduce a generation sideway to maintain the completeness of the learned embedding space. The two learning pathways collaborate and compete in a parameter-sharing manner, yielding considerably improved generalization ability to \"unseen\" dataset. More importantly, the two-pathway framework makes it possible to combine both labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which further enriches the embedding space for realistic generations. The experimental results prove that CR-GAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially when generating from \"unseen\" inputs in wild conditions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Yu Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Yu", "Xi Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng_0005:Xi", "Long Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Long", "Shaoting Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shaoting", "Dimitris N.
