We present a scale space perspective on blind deblurring algorithms, and introduce a cascaded scale space formulation for blind deblurring. This new formulation suggests a natural approach robust to noise and small scale structures through tying the estimation across multiple scales and balancing the contributions of different scales automatically by learning from data. The proposed formulation also allows to handle non-uniform blur with a straightforward extension. Experiments are conducted on both benchmark dataset and real-world images to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. One surprising finding based on our approach is that blur kernel estimation is not necessarily best at the finest scale.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Duke University", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Haichao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haichao", "Jianchao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jianchao"], "pages": 9}
