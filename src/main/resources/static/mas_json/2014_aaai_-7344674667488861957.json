While label reduction is critical to the efficient computation of merge-and-shrink heuristics, current theory only permits reducing labels in a limited number of cases. We generalize this theory so that labels can be reduced in every intermediate abstraction of a merge-and-shrink tree. This is particularly important for efficiently computing merge-and-shrink abstractions based on non-linear merge strategies. As a case study, we implement a nonlinear merge strategy based on the original work on merge-and-shrink heuristics in model checking by Drager et al.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e4t Bas ... l, Switzerland", "Universit\u00e4t Bas ... l, Switzerland", "Universit\u00e4t Bas ... l, Switzerland"], "authors": ["Silvan Sievers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sievers:Silvan", "Martin Wehrle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wehrle:Martin", "Malte Helmert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmert:Malte"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
