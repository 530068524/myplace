{"title": "Pushdown control-flow analysis for free.", "fields": ["control flow analysis", "intuition", "spurious relationship", "abstract interpretation", "static analysis"], "abstract": "Traditional control-flow analysis (CFA) for higher-order languages introduces spurious connections between callers and callees, and different invocations of a function may pollute each other's return flows. Recently, three distinct approaches have been published that provide perfect call-stack precision in a computable manner: CFA2, PDCFA, and AAC. Unfortunately, implementing CFA2 and PDCFA requires significant engineering effort. Furthermore, all three are computationally expensive. For a monovariant analysis, CFA2 is in O(2^n), PDCFA is in O(n^6), and AAC is in O(n^8). In this paper, we describe a new technique that builds on these but is both straightforward to implement and computationally inexpensive. The crucial insight is an unusual state-dependent allocation strategy for the addresses of continuations. Our technique imposes only a constant-factor overhead on the underlying analysis and costs only O(n^3) in the monovariant case. We present the intuitions behind this development, benchmarks demonstrating its efficacy, and a proof of the precision of this analysis.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Thomas Gilray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilray:Thomas", "Steven Lyde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyde:Steven", "Michael D.
