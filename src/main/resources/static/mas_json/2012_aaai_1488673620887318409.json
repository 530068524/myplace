{"title": "Evaluating Resistance to False-Name Manipulations in Elections.", "fields": ["voting", "correctness", "artificial intelligence", "statistical hypothesis testing", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In many mechanisms (especially online mechanisms), a strategic agent can influence the outcome by creating multiple false identities. We consider voting settings where the mechanism designer cannot completely prevent false-name manipulation, but may use false-name-limiting methods such as CAPTCHAs to influence the amount and characteristics of such manipulation. Such a designer would prefer, first, a high probability of obtaining the \"correct\" outcome, and second, a statistical method for evaluating the correctness of the outcome. In this paper, we focus on settings with two alternatives. We model voters as independently drawing a number of identities from a distribution that may be influenced by the choice of the false-name-limiting method. We give a criterion for the evaluation and comparison of these distributions. Then, given the results of an election in which false-name manipulation may have occurred, we propose and justify a statistical test for evaluating the outcome.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Bo Waggoner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waggoner:Bo", "Lirong Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Lirong", "Vincent Conitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conitzer:Vincent"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
