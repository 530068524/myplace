However, due to a lack of reliable indicators, it is still unclear how commonplace these attacks occur in the wild. In this work, we have designed and implemented a method to detect the occurrence of SSL man-in-the-middle attack on a top global website, Facebook. Over 3 million real-world SSL connections to this website were analyzed. Our results indicate that 0.2% of the SSL connections analyzed were tampered with forged SSL certificates, most of them related to antivirus software and corporate-scale content filters. We have also identified some SSL connections intercepted by malware. Limitations of the method and possible defenses to such attacks are also discussed.", "citation": "Citations (115)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Lin-Shung Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Lin=Shung", "Alex Rice.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rice:Alex", "Erling Ellingsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ellingsen:Erling", "Collin Jackson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jackson:Collin"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2014", "pages": 15}
