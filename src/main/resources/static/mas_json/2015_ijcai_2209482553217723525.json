{"title": "Optimal Network Security Hardening Using Attack Graph Games.", "fields": ["ciphertext only attack", "network administrator", "best response", "honeypot", "pre play attack"], "abstract": "Preventing attacks in a computer network is the core problem in network security. We introduce a new game-theoretic model of the interaction between a network administrator who uses limited resource to harden a network and an attacker who follows a multi-stage plan to attack the network. The possible plans of the attacker are compactly represented using attack graphs, while the defender adds fake targets (honeypots) to the network to deceive the attacker. The compact representation of the attacker's strategies presents a computational challenge and finding the best response of the attacker is NP-hard. We present a solution method that first translates an attack graph into an MDP and solves it using policy search with a set of pruning techniques. We present an empirical evaluation of the model and solution algorithms, evaluating scalability, the types of solutions that are generated for realistic cases, and sensitivity analysis.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Aarhus University", "University of Texas at El Paso"], "authors": ["Karel Durkota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durkota:Karel", "Viliam Lis\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lis=yacute=:Viliam", "Branislav Bosansk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosansk=yacute=:Branislav", "Christopher Kiekintveld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiekintveld:Christopher"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
