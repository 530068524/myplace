Focused on the creation of immersive and collaborative museum experiences, it provides a rationale for involving carefully selected multidisciplinary teams and users in the entire design cycle, and presents a process that supports this task, from research to development, pointing its value and limitations. In order to bring the discussion into context and exemplify the use of a group of methods that can support collaborative design, it introduces the case of a Brazilian Planetarium and Science Museum.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro", "Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro", "Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro", "Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro", "Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro"], "authors": ["Hugo Fuks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuks:Hugo", "Heloisa Moura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moura:Heloisa", "Debora Cardador.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cardador:Debora", "Katia Vega.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vega:Katia", "Wallace Ugulino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ugulino:Wallace", "Marcos Barbato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbato:Marcos"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
