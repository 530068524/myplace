{"title": "Exploring Expressive Augmented Reality: The FingAR Puppet System for Social Pretend Play.", "fields": ["divergent thinking", "cognitive development", "augmented reality", "early childhood", "tangible user interface"], "abstract": "We present \"FingAR Puppet\", an Augmented Reality (AR) system enhancing social pretend play by young children. Unlike goal-oriented AR systems that augment reality with informative instructions, FingAR Puppet helps children associate expressive interpretations with immediate reality. Empirical results show that FingAR Puppet promotes reasoning about emotional states, communication and divergent thinking during social pretend play for children 4-6 years old. We suggest that this study opens an interesting space for future AR systems to support complex cognitive and social development in early childhood. We also identify broader implications from using theories of cognitive development to guide the design of tangible and augmented interactions.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Zhen Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Zhen", "Alan F.
