{"title": "Profile-guided meta-programming.", "fields": ["parametric statistics", "profile guided optimization", "metaprogramming", "profiling", "compiler"], "abstract": "Contemporary compiler systems such as GCC, .NET, and LLVM incorporate profile-guided optimizations (PGOs) on low-level intermediate code and basic blocks, with impressive results over purely static heuristics. Recent work shows that profile information is also useful for performing source-to-source optimizations via meta-programming. For example, using profiling information to inform decisions about data structures and algorithms can potentially lead to asymptotic improvements in performance. We present a design for profile-guided meta-programming in a general-purpose meta-programming system. Our design is parametric over the particular profiler and meta-programming system. We implement this design in two different meta-programming systems---the syntactic extensions systems of Chez Scheme and Racket---and provide several profile-guided meta-programs as usability case studies.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Cisco Systems, Inc.", "Northeastern University", "Cisco Systems, Inc."], "authors": ["William J.
