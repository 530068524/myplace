The goal is to address the deadlock issue caused by the broken down of the targeted tower , and to reduce transmission power consumption. Performance analysis of the new mechanism is presented, in which the configuration of different number of electrical towers is discussed. Upon examination of the simulation results, we conclude that the proposed mechanism provides lower latency and power consumption compared to the traditional transmission mechanism, and guarantees the transmission robustness for the smart grid.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Wuhan University", "University of Tennessee", "Shanghai Inst.  ...
