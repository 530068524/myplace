{"title": "Im-O-Ret: Immersive object retrieval.", "fields": ["image retrieval", "multimedia information retrieval", "query expansion", "thumbnail", "data visualization"], "abstract": "The growing number of three-dimensional (3D) objects stored in digital libraries brought forth the challenge of search in 3D model collections. To address it, several approaches have been developed for 3D object retrieval. However, these approaches traditionally present query results as a list of thumbnails, and fail to take advantage of recent visualization and interaction technologies. In this paper, we propose an approach to 3D object retrieval using immersive VR for query result visualization. Query results are shown in a three-dimensional virtual space as 3D objects and users can explore these results by navigating in this virtual space and manipulating the scattered objects.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["INESC-ID", "INESC-ID", "INESC-ID"], "authors": ["Pedro B.
