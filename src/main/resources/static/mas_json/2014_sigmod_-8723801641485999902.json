{"title": "The PH-tree: a space-efficient storage structure and multi-dimensional index.", "fields": ["quadtree", "prefix", "radix tree", "range query", "spatial database"], "abstract": "We propose the PATRICIA-hypercube-tree, or PH-tree, a multi-dimensional data storage and indexing structure. It is based on binary PATRICIA-tries combined with hypercubes for efficient data access. Space efficiency is achieved by combining prefix sharing with a space optimised implementation. This leads to storage space requirements that are comparable or below storage of the same data in non-index structures such as arrays of objects. The storage structure also serves as a multi-dimensional index on all dimensions of the stored data. This enables efficient access to stored data via point and range queries. We explain the concept of the PH-tree and demonstrate the performance of a sample implementation on various datasets and compare it to other spatial indices such as the kD-tree. The experiments show that for larger datasets beyond 10^7 entries, the PH-tree increasingly and consistently outperforms other structures in terms of space efficiency, query performance and update performance.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Tilmann Z\u00e4schke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Z=auml=schke:Tilmann", "Christoph Zimmerli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmerli:Christoph", "Moira C.
