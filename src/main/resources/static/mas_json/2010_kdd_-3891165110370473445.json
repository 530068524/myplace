However, uncertainties are inherently accompanied with graph data in practice, and there is very few work on mining uncertain graph data. This paper investigates frequent subgraph mining on uncertain graphs under probabilistic semantics. Specifically, a measure called \u03c6-frequent probability is introduced to evaluate the degree of recurrence of subgraphs. Given a set of uncertain graphs and two numbers 0  S  with probability at least (1 - \u03b4/2) s , where  s  is the number of edges of  S . In addition, it is thoroughly discussed how to set \u03b4 to guarantee the overall approximation quality of the algorithm. The extensive experiments on real uncertain graph data verify that the algorithm is efficient and that the mining results have very high quality.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Zhaonian Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou:Zhaonian", "Hong Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Hong", "Jianzhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianzhong"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
