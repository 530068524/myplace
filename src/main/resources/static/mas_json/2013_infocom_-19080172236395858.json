Though current schedulers for Hadoop are quite successful, they still have room for improvement: map tasks (MapTasks) and reduce tasks (ReduceTasks) are not jointly optimized, albeit there is a strong dependence between them. This can cause job starvation and unfavorable data locality. In this paper, we design and implement a resource-aware scheduler for Hadoop. It couples the progresses of MapTasks and ReduceTasks, utilizing Wait Scheduling for ReduceTasks and Random Peeking Scheduling for MapTasks to jointly optimize the task placement. This mitigates the starvation problem and improves the overall data locality. Our extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in job response times.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Jian Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Jian", "Xiaoqiao Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Xiaoqiao", "Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Li"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
