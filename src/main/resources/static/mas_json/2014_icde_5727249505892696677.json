The era of big data calls for scalable algorithms to support large-scale string similarity joins. In this paper, we study scalable string similarity joins using MapReduce. We propose a MapReduce-based framework, called MASSJOIN, which supports both set-based similarity functions and character-based similarity functions. We extend the existing partition-based signature scheme to support set-based similarity functions. We utilize the signatures to generate key-value pairs. To reduce the transmission cost, we merge key-value pairs to significantly reduce the number of key-value pairs, from cubic to linear complexity, while not sacrificing the pruning power. To improve the performance, we incorporate \u201clight-weight\u201d filter units into the key-value pairs which can be utilized to prune large number of dissimilar pairs without significantly increasing the transmission cost. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Dong Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Dong", "Guoliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Guoliang", "Shuang Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Shuang", "Jiannan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jiannan", "Jianhua Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jianhua"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
