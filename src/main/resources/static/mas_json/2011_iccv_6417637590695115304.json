As another extension, we adopt a nonlinear distance function and approximate it by neural network. For fair comparison, we also experiment on the regression problem of age estimation from face images, and the results are very competitive among the state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["East China Normal University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Na Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Na"], "pages": 6}
