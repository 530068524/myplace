However, these grammar-based systems have difficulty scaling to large data sets and large numbers of rules. Inspired by traditional database research, we propose an algebraic approach to rule-based IE that addresses these scalability issues through query optimization. The operators of our algebra are motivated by our experience in building several rule-based extraction programs over diverse data sets. We present the operators of our algebra and propose several optimization strategies motivated by the text-specific characteristics of our operators. Finally we validate the potential benefits of our approach by extensive experiments over real-world blog data.", "citation": "Citations (139)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Frederick Reiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reiss:Frederick", "Sriram Raghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavan:Sriram", "Rajasekar Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Rajasekar", "Huaiyu Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Huaiyu", "Shivakumar Vaithyanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaithyanathan:Shivakumar"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
