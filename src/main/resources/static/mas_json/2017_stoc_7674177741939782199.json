Specifically, we provide nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the space complexity of calculating a (1\u00b1N )-approximation to the norm of the stream, for every 0 \u00e2  1  log n ) factors.) We further extend those bounds to any large approximation ratio  D \u00e2 \ufffd 1.1, showing that the decrease in space complexity is proportional to  D  2 , and that this factor the best possible. All of the bounds depend on the median of  l ( x ) when  x  is drawn uniformly from the  l  2  unit sphere. The same median governs many phenomena in high-dimensional spaces, such as large-deviation bounds and the critical dimension in Dvoretzky\u00e2  s Theorem.   The family of symmetric norms contains several well-studied norms, such as all  l   p  \ufffd norms, and indeed we provide a new explanation for the disparity in space complexity between  p \u00e2 \ufffd 2 and  p >2. In addition, we apply our general results to easily derive bounds for several norms that were not studied before in the streaming model, including the top- k  norm and the  k -support norm, which was recently employed for machine learning tasks. Overall, these results make progress on two outstanding problems in the area of sublinear algorithms (Problems 5 and 30 in\ufffd  ) .", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Johns Hopkins University", "ETH Zurich", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jaroslaw Blasiok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blasiok:Jaroslaw", "Vladimir Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Vladimir", "Stephen R.
