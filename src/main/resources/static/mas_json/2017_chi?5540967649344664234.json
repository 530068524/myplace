{"title": "GazeEverywhere: Enabling Gaze-only User Interaction on an Unmodified Desktop PC in Everyday Scenarios.", "fields": ["touchpad", "eye tracking", "smooth pursuit", "gaze", "dwell time"], "abstract": "Eye tracking is becoming more and more affordable, and thus gaze has the potential to become a viable input modality for human-computer interaction. We present the GazeEverywhere solution that can replace the mouse with gaze control by adding a transparent layer on top of the system GUI. It comprises three parts: i) the SPOCK interaction method that is based on smooth pursuit eye movements and does not suffer from the Midas touch problem; ii) an online recalibration algorithm that continuously improves gaze-tracking accuracy using the SPOCK target projections as reference points; and iii) an optional hardware setup utilizing head-up display technology to project superimposed dynamic stimuli onto the PC screen where a software modification of the system is not feasible. In validation experiments, we show that GazeEverywhere's throughput according to ISO 9241-9 was improved over dwell time based interaction methods and nearly reached trackpad level. Online recalibration reduced interaction target ('button') size by about 25%. Finally, a case study showed that users were able to browse the internet and successfully run Wikirace using gaze only, without any plug-ins or other modifications.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Simon Schenk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schenk:Simon", "Marc Dreiser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dreiser:Marc", "Gerhard Rigoll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rigoll:Gerhard", "Michael Dorr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dorr:Michael"], "pages": 11}
