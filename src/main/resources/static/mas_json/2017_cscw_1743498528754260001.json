{"title": "Identifying Women's Experiences With and Strategies for Mitigating Negative Effects of Online Harassment.", "fields": ["feminist theory", "online identity", "popularity", "harassment", "harm"], "abstract": "The popularity, availability, and ubiquity of information and communication technologies create new opportunities for online harassment. The present study evaluates factors associated with young adult women's online harassment experiences through a multi-factor measure accounting for the frequency and severity of negative events. Findings from a survey of 659 undergraduate and graduate students highlight the relationship between harassment, well-being, and engagement in strategies to manage one's online identity. We further identify differences in harassment experiences across three popular social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We conclude by discussing this study's contribution to feminist theory and describing five potential design interventions derived from our data that may minimize these negative experiences, mitigate the psychological harm they cause, and provide women with more proactive ways to regain agency when using communication technologies.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Jessica Vitak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitak:Jessica", "Kalyani Chadha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chadha:Kalyani", "Linda Steiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steiner:Linda", "Zahra Ashktorab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ashktorab:Zahra"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 15}
