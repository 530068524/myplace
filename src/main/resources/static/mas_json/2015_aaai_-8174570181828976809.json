{"title": "Hedonic Coalition Formation in Networks.", "fields": ["convergence", "graph", "mathematical optimization", "locality", "if and only if"], "abstract": "Coalition formation is a fundamental problem in the organization of many multi-agent systems. In large populations, the formation of coalitions is often restricted by structural visibility and locality constraints under which agents can reorganize. We capture and study this aspect using a novel network-based model for dynamic locality within the popular framework of hedonic coalition formation games. We analyze the effects of network-based visibility and structure on the convergence of coalition formation processes to stable states. Our main result is a tight characterization of the structures based on which dynamic coalition formation can stabilize quickly. Maybe surprisingly, polynomial-time convergence can be achieved if and only if coalition formation is based on complete or star graphs.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Martin Hoefer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoefer:Martin", "Daniel Vaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaz:Daniel", "Lisa Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner:Lisa"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
