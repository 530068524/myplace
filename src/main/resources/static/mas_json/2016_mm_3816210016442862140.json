Automatic generation of emotional comments to a video has great potential to significantly increase user engagement in many socio-video applications (e.g., chat bot). Nevertheless, the problem of video commenting has been overlooked by the research community. The major challenges are that the generated comments are to be not only as natural as those from human beings, but also relevant to the video content. We present in this paper a novel two-stage deep learning-based approach to automatic video commenting. Our approach consists of two components. The first component, similar video search, efficiently finds the visually similar videos w.r.t. a given video using approximate nearest-neighbor search based on the learned deep video representations, while the second dynamic ranking effectively ranks the comments associated with the searched similar videos by learning a deep multi-view embedding space. For modeling the emotional view of videos, we incorporate visual sentiment, video content, and text comments into the learning of the embedding space. On a newly collected dataset with over 102K videos and 10.6M comments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and achieves human-level video commenting.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yehao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yehao", "Ting Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Ting", "Tao Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Tao", "Hongyang Chao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chao:Hongyang", "Yong Rui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rui:Yong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
