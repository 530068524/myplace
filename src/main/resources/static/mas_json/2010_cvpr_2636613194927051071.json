Although convenient, such coarse segmentation results in several problems in tracking \u2014 drift, switching of targets, poor target localization, to name a few \u2014 since it inherently includes extra non-target pixels if the mask is larger than the target or excludes some portion of target pixels if the mask is smaller than the target. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for jointly solving segmentation and tracking. Starting from a joint Gaussian distribution over all the pixels, candidate target locations are evaluated by first computing a pixel-level segmentation and then explicitly including this segmentation in the probability model. The segmentation is also used to incrementally update the probability model based on a modified probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA). Our experimental results show that the proposed method of explicitly considering pixellevel segmentation as a part of solving the tracking problem significantly improves the robustness and performance of tracking compared to other state-of-the-art trackers, particularly for tracking multiple overlapping targets.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chad Aeschliman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aeschliman:Chad", "Johnny Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Johnny", "Avinash C.
