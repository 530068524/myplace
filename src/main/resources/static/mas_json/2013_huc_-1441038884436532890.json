Welfare assessments in dogs rely on objective observations of both frequency and variability of individual behaviour traits, which is often difficult to obtain in a dog's everyday life. In this paper we have identified a set of activities, which are linked to behaviour traits that are relevant for a dog's wellbeing. We developed a collar-worn accelerometry platform that records dog behaviours in naturalistic environments. A statistical classification framework is used for recognising dog activities. In an experimental evaluation we analysed the naturalistic behaviour of 18 dogs and were able to recognise a total of 17 different activities with approximately 70% classification accuracy. The presented system is the first of its kind that allows for robust and detailed analysis of dog activities in naturalistic environments.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["Cassim Ladha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ladha:Cassim", "Nils Y.
