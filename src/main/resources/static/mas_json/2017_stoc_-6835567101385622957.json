{"title": "The integrality gap of the Goemans-Linial SDP relaxation for sparsest cut is at least a constant multiple of \u221alog n.", "fields": ["group representation", "isoperimetric inequality", "multiple", "cayley graph", "heisenberg group"], "abstract": "We prove that the integrality gap of the Goemans\u00e2  Linial semidefinite programming relaxation for the Sparsest Cut Problem is I\u00a9(\u00e2  log n ) on inputs with  n  vertices, thus matching the previously best known upper bound (log n ) 1/2+ o (1)  up to lower-order factors. This statement is a consequence of the following new isoperimetric-type inequality. Consider the 8-regular graph whose vertex set is the 5-dimensional integer grid \u00e2 \ufffd 5  and where each vertex ( a , b , c , d , e )\u00e2   \u00e2 \ufffd 5  is connected to the 8 vertices ( a \u00b1 1, b , c , d , e ), ( a , b \u00b1 1, c , d , e ), ( a , b , c \u00b1 1, d , e \u00b1  a ), ( a , b , c , d \u00b1 1, e \u00b1  b ). This graph is known as the Cayley graph of the 5-dimensional discrete Heisenberg group. Given I\u00a9\u00e2   \u00e2 \ufffd 5 , denote the size of its edge boundary in this graph (a.k.a. the  horizontal perimeter  of I\u00a9) by |\u00e2    h  I\u00a9|. For  t \u00e2   \u00e2  , denote by |\u00e2    v    t  I\u00a9| the number of ( a , b , c , d , e )\u00e2   \u00e2 \ufffd 5  such that exactly one of the two vectors ( a , b , c , d , e ),( a , b , c , d , e + t ) is in I\u00a9. The  vertical perimeter  of I\u00a9 is defined to be |\u00e2    v  I\u00a9|= \u00e2  \u00e2    t =1  \u00e2   |\u00e2    v    t  I\u00a9| 2 / t  2 . We show that every subset I\u00a9\u00e2   \u00e2 \ufffd 5  satisfies |\u00e2    v  I\u00a9|= O (|\u00e2    h  I\u00a9|). This  vertical-versus-horizontal isoperimetric inequality  yields the above-stated integrality gap for Sparsest Cut and answers several geometric and analytic questions of independent interest.   The theorem stated above is the culmination of a program whose aim is to understand the performance of the Goemans\u00e2  Linial semidefinite program through the embeddability properties of Heisenberg groups. These investigations have mathematical significance even beyond their established relevance to approximation algorithms and combinatorial optimization. In particular they contribute to a range of mathematical disciplines including functional analysis, geometric group theory, harmonic analysis, sub-Riemannian geometry, geometric measure theory, ergodic theory, group representations, and metric differentiation. This article builds on the above cited works, with the \u00e2  twist\u00e2   that while those works were equally valid for any finite dimensional Heisenberg group, our result holds for the Heisenberg group of dimension 5 (or higher) but  fails  for the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group. This insight leads to our core contribution, which is a deduction of an endpoint  L  1 -boundedness of a certain singular integral on \u00e2   5  from the (local)  L  2 -boundedness of the corresponding singular integral on \u00e2   3 . To do this, we devise a corona-type decomposition of subsets of a Heisenberg group, in the spirit of the construction that David and Semmes performed in \u00e2    n  , but with two main conceptual differences (in addition to more technical differences that arise from the peculiarities of the geometry of Heisenberg group). Firstly, the\u00e2  atoms\u00e2   of our decomposition are perturbations of  intrinsic Lipschitz graphs  in the sense of Franchi, Serapioni, and Serra Cassano (plus the requisite \u00e2  wild\u00e2   regions that satisfy a Carleson packing condition). Secondly, we control the local overlap of our corona decomposition by using quantitative monotonicity rather than Jones-type I\ufffd-numbers.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Princeton University", "New York University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Assaf Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Assaf", "Robert Young.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Young:Robert"], "pages": 12}
