The scale of the sensory data in many applications has already exceeds several petabytes annually, which is beyond the computation and transmission capabilities of the conventional WSNs. On the other hand, the information carried by big sensory data has high redundancy because of strong correlation among sensory data. In this paper, we define the concept of e-dominant dataset, which is only a small data set and can represent the vast information carried by big sensory data with the information loss rate being less than e, where e can be arbitrarily small. We prove that drawing the minimum e-dominant dataset is polynomial time solvable and provide a centralized algorithm with 0(n 3 ) time complexity. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm with constant complexity (O(l)) is also designed. It is shown that the result returned by the distributed algorithm can satisfy the e requirement with a near optimal size. Finally, the extensive real experiment results and simulation results are carried out. The results indicate that all the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of accuracy and energy efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Georgia State University", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Siyao Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Siyao", "Zhipeng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Zhipeng", "Jianzhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianzhong", "Xiaolin Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Xiaolin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
