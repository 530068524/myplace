Managing such data is currently beyond the skills of casual users. We describe ongoing work that has as its goal the development of foundations for declarative distributed data management. In this approach, we see the Web as a knowledge base consisting of distributed logical facts and rules. Our objective is to enable automated reasoning over this knowledge base, ultimately improving the quality of service and of data. For this, we use Webdamlog, a Datalogstyle language with rule delegation. We outline ongoing efforts on the Web dam Exchange platform that combines Webdamlog evaluation with communication and security protocols.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Coll\u00e8ge de France", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Serge Abiteboul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abiteboul:Serge", "\u00c9milien Antoine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antoine:=Eacute=milien", "Julia Stoyanovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoyanovich:Julia"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
