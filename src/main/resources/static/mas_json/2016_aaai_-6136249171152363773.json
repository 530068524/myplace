Our main contributions are four different algorithms for private Bayesian inference on probabilistic graphical models. These include two mechanisms for adding noise to the Bayesian updates, either directly to the posterior parameters, or to their Fourier transform so as to preserve update consistency. We also utilise a recently introduced posterior sampling mechanism, for which we prove bounds for the specific but general case of discrete Bayesian networks; and we introduce a maximum-a-posteriori private mechanism. Our analysis includes utility and privacy bounds, with a novel focus on the influence of graph structure on privacy. Worked examples and experiments with Bayesian naive Bayes and Bayesian linear regression illustrate the application of our mechanisms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "Chalmers University of Technology"], "authors": ["Zuhe Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zuhe", "Benjamin I.
