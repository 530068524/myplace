We present a new methodology for modeling and predicting such future news events using machine learning and data mining techniques. Our Pundit algorithm generalizes examples of causality pairs to infer a causality predictor. To obtain precise labeled causality examples, we mine 150 years of news articles, and apply semantic natural language modeling techniques to titles containing certain predefined causality patterns. For generalization, the model uses a vast amount of world knowledge ontologies mined from LinkedData, containing ~200 datasets with approximately 20 billion relations. Empirical evaluation on real news articles shows that our Pundit algorithm reaches a human-level performance.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kira Radinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radinsky:Kira", "Sagie Davidovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davidovich:Sagie", "Shaul Markovitch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markovitch:Shaul"], "conf": "www", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
