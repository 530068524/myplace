{"title": "Embed and Project: Discrete Sampling with Universal Hashing.", "fields": ["hash function", "combinatorial search", "markov chain monte carlo", "universal hashing", "graphical model"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution defined over a high-dimensional discrete set, specified for instance by a graphical model. We propose a sampling algorithm, called PAWS, based on embedding the set into a higher-dimensional space which is then randomly projected using universal hash functions to a lower-dimensional subspace and explored using combinatorial search methods. Our scheme can leverage fast combinatorial optimization tools as a blackbox and, unlike MCMC methods, samples produced are guaranteed to be within an (arbitrarily small) constant factor of the true probability distribution. We demonstrate that by using state-of-the-art combinatorial search tools, PAWS can efficiently sample from Ising grids with strong interactions and from software verification instances, while MCMC and variational methods fail in both cases.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "IBM", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Stefano Ermon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ermon:Stefano", "Carla P.
