Extending a previous model for word segmentation, our model is called a Pitman-Yor Hidden SemiMarkov Model (PYHSMM) and considered as a method to build a class n-gram language model directly from strings, while integrating character and word level information. Experimental results on standard datasets on Japanese, Chinese and Thai revealed it outperforms previous results to yield the state-of-the-art accuracies. This model will also serve to analyze a structure of a language whose words are not identified a priori.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Denso", "Denso", "Institute of St ... cal Mathematics"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kei Uchiumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uchiumi:Kei", "Hiroshi Tsukahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsukahara:Hiroshi", "Daichi Mochihashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mochihashi:Daichi"], "pages": 9}
