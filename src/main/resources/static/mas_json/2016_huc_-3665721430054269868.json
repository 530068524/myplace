Unfortunately, parents find it difficult to apply the training to their child in everyday life and often give up on their parent-child interaction. In this work, we propose and evaluate TalkLIME -- a mobile system that provides real-time feedback to improve the parent-child interaction and reinforce parent-training intervention. We first conduct a survey to understand parents' feedback preference for the mobile system and determine that a non-invasive feedback using the mobile phones screen is preferable. TalkLIME was developed to provide real-time feedback through the mobile phone screen while also providing motivation to the parents to consistently continue parent-child interaction through both short-term and long-term goals. A six-weeks user study was conducted with eight parents and their children with language delay. Our results show that the experimental group who used TalkLIME showed a significant improvement in the child's initiation ratio, an important metric in the language development of children.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Ewha Womans University", "Ewha Womans University"], "authors": ["Seokwoo Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Seokwoo", "Seungho Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seungho", "John Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:John", "Wonjeong Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Wonjeong", "Dongsun Yim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yim:Dongsun"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
