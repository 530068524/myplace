In this paper, we present a representation learning approach, in which we transform surface features into a latent space that facilitates RST discourse parsing. By combining the machinery of large-margin transition-based structured prediction with representation learning, our method jointly learns to parse discourse while at the same time learning a discourse-driven projection of surface features. The resulting shift-reduce discourse parser obtains substantial improvements over the previous state-of-the-art in predicting relations and nuclearity on the RST Treebank.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yangfeng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Yangfeng", "Jacob Eisenstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisenstein:Jacob"], "pages": 12}
