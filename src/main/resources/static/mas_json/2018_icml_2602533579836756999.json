{"title": "An Alternative View: When Does SGD Escape Local Minima?", "fields": ["gradient noise", "convex function", "saddle point", "stochastic gradient descent", "phenomenon"], "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning. Although being commonly viewed as a fast but not accurate version of gradient descent (GD), it always finds better solutions than GD for modern neural networks. \nIn order to understand this phenomenon, we take an alternative view that SGD is working on the convolved (thus smoothed) version of the loss function. We show that, even if the function $f$ has many bad local minima or saddle points, as long as for every point $x$, the weighted average of the gradients of its neighborhoods is one point convex with respect to the desired solution $x^*$, SGD will get close to, and then stay around $x^*$ with constant probability. More specifically, SGD will not get stuck at \"sharp\" local minima with small diameters, as long as the neighborhoods of these regions contain enough gradient information. The neighborhood size is controlled by step size and gradient noise. \nOur result identifies a set of functions that SGD provably works, which is much larger than the set of convex functions. Empirically, we observe that the loss surface of neural networks enjoys nice one point convexity properties locally, therefore our theorem helps explain why SGD works so well for neural networks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Princeton University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Robert Kleinberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleinberg:Robert", "Yuanzhi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanzhi", "Yang Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Yang"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
