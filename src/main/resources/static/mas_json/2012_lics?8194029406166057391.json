{"title": "Two-Variable First-Order Logic with Equivalence Closure.", "fields": ["maximum satisfiability problem", "equivalence relation", "finite model property", "descriptive complexity theory", "logical equivalence", "boolean satisfiability problem"], "abstract": "We consider the satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems for extensions of the two-variable fragment of first-order logic in which an equivalence closure operator can be applied to a fixed number of binary predicates. We show that the satisfiability problem for two-variable, first-order logic with equivalence closure applied to two binary predicates is in 2NExpTime, and we obtain a matching lower bound by showing that the satisfiability problem for two-variable first-order logic in the presence of two equivalence relations is 2NExpTime-hard. The logics in question lack the finite model property; however, we show that the same complexity bounds hold for the corresponding finite satisfiability problems. We further show that the satisfiability (=finite satisfiability) problem for the two-variable fragment of first-order logic with equivalence closure applied to a single binary predicate is NExpTime-complete.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Manchester", "Opole University"], "authors": ["Emanuel Kieronski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kieronski:Emanuel", "Jakub Michaliszyn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michaliszyn:Jakub", "Ian Pratt-Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pratt=Hartmann:Ian", "Lidia Tendera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tendera:Lidia"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
