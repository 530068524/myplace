However, designing objects for fabrication still requires 3D modeling skills, thereby rendering such technologies inaccessible to a wide user-group. In this paper, we introduce MixFab, a mixed-reality environment for personal fabrication that lowers the barrier for users to engage in personal fabrication. Users design objects in an immersive augmented reality environment, interact with virtual objects in a direct gestural manner and can introduce existing physical objects effortlessly into their designs. We describe the design and implementation of MixFab, a user-defined gesture study that informed this design, show artifacts designed with the system and describe a user study evaluating the system's prototype.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christian Weichel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weichel:Christian", "Manfred Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Manfred", "David Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:David", "Nicolas Villar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villar:Nicolas", "Hans-Werner Gellersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gellersen:Hans=Werner"], "pages": 10}
