{"title": "Mining Measured Information from Text.", "fields": ["units of measurement", "extractor", "dot pitch", "plain text", "phrase"], "abstract": "We present an approach to extract measured information from text (e.g., a $1370~^{\\circ}C$ melting point, a BMI greater than 29.9 kg/m$^2$). Such extractions are critically important across a wide range of domains --- especially those involving search and exploration of scientific and technical documents. We first propose a rule-based entity extractor to mine measured quantities (i.e., a numeric value paired with a measurement unit), which supports a vast and comprehensive set of both common and obscure measurement units. Our method is highly robust and can correctly recover valid measured quantities even when significant errors are introduced through the process of converting document formats like PDF to plain text. Next, we describe an approach to extracting the properties being measured (e.g., the property ``pixel pitch'' in the phrase ``a pixel pitch as high as $352~\\mu m$''). Finally, we present MQSearch: the realization of a search engine with full support for measured information.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Institute for D ... andria, VA, USA", "Institute for D ... andria, VA, USA", "Institute for D ... andria, VA, USA"], "authors": ["Arun S.
