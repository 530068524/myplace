Its essence is the Best-Buddies Similarity (BBS), a useful, robust, and parameter-free similarity measure between two sets of points. BBS is based on counting the number of Best-Buddies Pairs (BBPs)\u2014pairs of points in source and target sets, where each point is the nearest neighbor of the other. BBS has several key features that make it robust against complex geometric deformations and high levels of outliers, such as those arising from background clutter and occlusions. We study these properties, provide a statistical analysis that justifies them, and demonstrate the consistent success of BBS on a challenging real-world dataset.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Tel Aviv University", "Google", "Tel Aviv University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tali Dekel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dekel:Tali", "Shaul Oron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oron:Shaul", "Michael Rubinstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubinstein:Michael", "Shai Avidan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avidan:Shai", "William T.
