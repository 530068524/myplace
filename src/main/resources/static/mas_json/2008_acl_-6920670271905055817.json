{"title": "Using Conditional Random Fields to Extract Contexts and Answers of Questions from Online Forums.", "fields": ["crfs", "question answering", "conditional random field", "thread", "information extraction"], "abstract": "Online forum discussions often contain vast amounts of questions that are the focuses of discussions. Extracting contexts and answers together with the questions will yield not only a coherent forum summary but also a valuable QA knowledge base. In this paper, we propose a general framework based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to detect the contexts and answers of questions from forum threads. We improve the basic framework by Skip-chain CRFs and 2D CRFs to better accommodate the features of forums for better performance. Experimental results show that our techniques are very promising.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Aalborg University", "Microsoft", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shilin Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Shilin", "Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao", "Chin-Yew Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chin=Yew", "Xiaoyan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoyan"], "pages": 9}
