Dynamic impact analysis is one practical form that computes smaller  impact  sets than static alternatives for concrete sets of executions. However, existing dynamic approaches can still produce impact sets that are too large to be useful. To address this problem, we present a novel  dynamic  impact analysis called DIVER that exploits  static  dependencies to identify  runtime  impacts much more precisely without reducing safety and at acceptable costs. Our preliminary empirical evaluation shows that DIVER can significantly increase the precision of dynamic impact analysis.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Notre Dame", "University of Notre Dame"], "authors": ["Haipeng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Haipeng", "Ra\u00fal A.
