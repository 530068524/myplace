{"title": "Optimal Induced Universal Graphs and Adjacency Labeling for Trees.", "fields": ["implicit graph", "graph energy", "coxeter graph", "edge graceful labeling", "triangle free graph", "universal graph", "degeneracy"], "abstract": "We show that there exists a graph G with O(n) nodes, where any forest of n nodes is a node-induced sub graph of G. Furthermore, for constant arboricity k, the result implies the existence of a graph with O(nk) nodes that contains all n-node graphs as node-induced sub graphs, matching a a#x03A9;(nk) lower bound. The lower bound and previously best upper bounds were presented in Alstrup and Rauhe (FOCS'02). Our upper bounds are obtained through a log2(n) + O(1) labeling scheme for adjacency queries in forests. We hereby solve an open problem being raised repeatedly over decades, e.g. In Kannan, Naor, Rudich (STOC 1988), Chung (J. Of Graph Theory 1990), Fraigniaud and Korman (SODA 2010).", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Stephen Alstrup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alstrup:Stephen", "S\u00f8ren Dahlgaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dahlgaard:S=oslash=ren", "Mathias B\u00e6k Tejs Knudsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knudsen:Mathias_B=aelig=k_Tejs"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 16}
