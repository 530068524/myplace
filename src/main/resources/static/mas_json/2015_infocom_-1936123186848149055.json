{"title": "On multiplexing flows: Does it hurt or not?", "fields": ["kendall s notation", "m m queue", "bulk queue", "m d c queue", "d m 1 queue"], "abstract": "This paper analyzes queueing behavior subject to multiplexing a stochastic process M(n) of flows, and not a constant as conventionally assumed. By first considering the case when M(n) is iid, it is shown that flows' multiplexing \u2018hurts\u2019 the queue size (i.e., the queue size increases in distribution). The simplicity of the iid case enables the quantification of the \u2018best\u2019 and \u2018worst\u2019 distributions of M(n), i.e., minimizing/maximizing the queue size. The more general, and also realistic, case when M(n) is Markov-modulated reveals an interesting behavior: flows' multiplexing \u2018hurts\u2019 but only when the multiplexed flows are sufficiently long. An important caveat raised by such observations is that the conventional approximation of M(n) by a constant can be very misleading for queueing analysis.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Warwick"], "authors": ["Florin Ciucu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciucu:Florin", "Felix Poloczek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poloczek:Felix"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
