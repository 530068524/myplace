We show that deciding properties of graphs definable in first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on nowhere dense graph classes. At least for graph classes closed under taking subgraphs, this result is optimal: it was known before that for all classes  C  of graphs closed under taking subgraphs, if deciding first-order properties of graphs in  C  is fixed-parameter tractable, then  C  must be nowhere dense (under a reasonable complexity theoretic assumption).   As a by-product, we give an algorithmic construction of sparse neighbourhood covers for nowhere dense graphs. This extends and improves previous constructions of neighbourhood covers for graph classes with excluded minors. At the same time, our construction is considerably simpler than those.   Our proofs are based on a new game-theoretic characterisation of nowhere dense graphs that allows for a recursive version of locality-based algorithms on these classes. On the logical side, we prove a \"rank-preserving\" version of Gaifman's locality theorem.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "RWTH Aachen University", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Martin Grohe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grohe:Martin", "Stephan Kreutzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kreutzer:Stephan", "Sebastian Siebertz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siebertz:Sebastian"], "pages": 10}
