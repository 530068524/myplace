{"title": "Efficient Kernel Learning from Side Information Using ADMM.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "solver", "order of magnitude", "semi supervised learning", "kernel method"], "abstract": "Side information is highly useful in the learning of a nonparametric kernel matrix. However, this often leads to an expensive semidefinite program (SDP). In recent years, a number of dedicated solvers have been proposed. Though much better than off-the-shelf SDP solvers, they still cannot scale to large data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel solver based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The key idea is to use a low-rank decomposition of the kernel matrix K = VTU, with the constraint that V = U. The resultant optimization problem, though non-convex, has favorable convergence properties and can be efficiently solved without requiring eigen-decomposition in each iteration. Experimental results on a number of real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is as accurate as directly solving the SDP, but can be one to two orders of magnitude faster.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["En-Liang Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:En=Liang", "James T.
