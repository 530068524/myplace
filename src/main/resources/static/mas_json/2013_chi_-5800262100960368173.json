We present Around-Device Binning, or AD-Binning, a novel mobile user interface that allows users to off-load mobile content in the space around the device. We informed our implementation of AD-Binning by exploring various design factors, such as the minimum around-device target size, suitable item selection methods, and techniques for placing content in off-screen space. In a task requiring exploration, we find that AD-Binning improves browsing efficiency by avoiding the minute selection and flicking mechanisms needed for on-screen interaction. We conclude with design guidelines for off screen content storage and browsing.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of Manitoba", "Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt", "University of Manitoba"], "authors": ["Khalad Hasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasan:Khalad", "David Ahlstr\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahlstr=ouml=m:David", "Pourang Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Pourang"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
