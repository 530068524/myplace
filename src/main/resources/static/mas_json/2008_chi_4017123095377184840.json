We report on an exploratory study of individuals, pairs, and triples engaged in information analysis tasks using paper-based visualizations. From our study results, we derive a framework that captures the analysis activities of co-located teams and individuals. Comparing this framework with existing models of the information analysis process suggests that information visualization tools may benefit from providing a flexible temporal flow of analysis actions.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of British Columbia", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Petra Isenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isenberg:Petra", "Anthony Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Anthony", "Sheelagh Carpendale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carpendale:Sheelagh"], "pages": 10}
