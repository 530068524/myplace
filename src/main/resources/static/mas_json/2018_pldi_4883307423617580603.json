{"title": "Modularity for decidability of deductive verification with applications to distributed systems.", "fields": ["implementation", "raft", "paxos", "modular design", "decidability"], "abstract": "Proof automation can substantially increase productivity in formal verification of complex systems. However, unpredictablility of automated provers in handling quantified formulas presents a major hurdle to usability of these tools. We propose to solve this problem not by improving the provers, but by using a modular proof methodology that allows us to produce  decidable  verification conditions. Decidability greatly improves predictability of proof automation, resulting in a more practical verification approach. We apply this methodology to develop verified implementations of distributed protocols, demonstrating its effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Microsoft", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Marcelo Taube.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taube:Marcelo", "Giuliano Losa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Losa:Giuliano", "Kenneth L.
