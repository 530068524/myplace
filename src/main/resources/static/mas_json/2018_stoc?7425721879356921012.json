{"title": "Fully dynamic maximal independent set with sublinear update time.", "fields": ["adversary", "deterministic algorithm", "degree", "maximal independent set", "sublinear function"], "abstract": "A maximal independent set (MIS) can be maintained in an evolving  m -edge graph by simply recomputing it from scratch in  O ( m ) time after each update. But can it be maintained in time sublinear in  m  in fully dynamic graphs?    We answer this fundamental open question in the affirmative. We present a  deterministic  algorithm with amortized update time  O (min{\u0394, m  3/4 }), where \u0394 is a fixed bound on the maximum degree in the graph and  m  is the (dynamically changing) number of edges.    We further present a distributed implementation of our algorithm with  O (min{\u0394, m  3/4 }) amortized message complexity, and  O (1) amortized round complexity and adjustment complexity (the number of vertices that change their output after each update). This strengthens a similar result by Censor-Hillel, Haramaty, and Karnin (PODC\u201916) that required an assumption of a non-adaptive oblivious adversary.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Sepehr Assadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Assadi:Sepehr", "Krzysztof Onak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onak:Krzysztof", "Baruch Schieber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schieber:Baruch", "Shay Solomon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solomon:Shay"], "pages": 12}
