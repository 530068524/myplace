In this paper, we propose a novel method of JPEG steganalysis. Based on an observation of bi-variate generalized Gaussian distribution in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain, neighboring joint density features on both intra-block and inter-block are extracted. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are applied for detection. Experimental results indicate that this new method prominently improves a current art of steganalysis in detecting several steganographic systems in JPEG images. Our study also shows that it is more accurate to evaluate the detection performance in terms of both image complexity and information hiding ratio.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology", "New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology", "New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology"], "authors": ["Qingzhong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qingzhong", "Andrew H.
