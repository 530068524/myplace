{"title": "Entity Retrieval via Entity Factoid Hierarchy.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "tree structure", "entity linking", "factoid", "factor graph"], "abstract": "We propose that entity queries are generated via a two-step process: users first select entity facts that can distinguish target entities from the others; and then choose words to describe each selected fact. Based on this query generation paradigm, we propose a new entity representation model named as entity factoid hierarchy. An entity factoid hierarchy is a tree structure composed of factoid nodes. A factoid node describes one or more facts about the entity in different information granularities. The entity factoid hierarchy is constructed via a factor graph model, and the inference on the factor graph is achieved by a modified variant of Multiple-try Metropolis algorithm. Entity retrieval is performed by decomposing entity queries and computing the query likelihood on the entity factoid hierarchy. Using an array of benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves the retrieval performance over existing models.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Chunliang Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Chunliang", "Wai Lam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lam:Wai", "Yi Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Yi"], "pages": 10}
