Typically, its performance is based on the ability of a learner to meet a fixed objective and does not account for preferences (e.g. low false positives) arising from an underlying classification problem. We use user preferences gathered on holdout data to guide the two-sided advantages of individual weak learners and tune them to meet these preferences. Extensive experiments show that while arbitrary preferences might be difficult to meet for a single classifier, a non-linear ensemble of classifiers as the one constructed by martingale boosting, performs better.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ashish Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni:Ashish", "Pushpak Burange.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burange:Pushpak", "Ganesh Ramakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramakrishnan:Ganesh"], "pages": 7}
