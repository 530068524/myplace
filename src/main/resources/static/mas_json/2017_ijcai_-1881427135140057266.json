A pernicious concern, though, is that of vote buying, which occurs when a bad actor seeks to buy ballots, paying someone to vote against their own intent. This becomes possible whenever a voter is able to sell evidence of which way she voted. We show how to thwart vote buying through decoy ballots, which are not counted but are indistinguishable from real ballots to a buyer. We show that an Election Authority can significantly reduce the power of vote buying through a small number of optimally distributed decoys, and model societal processes by which decoys could be distributed.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["David C.
