{"title": "FoodBoard: surface contact imaging for food recognition.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "embedded system", "computer science", "software portability"], "abstract": "We describe FoodBoard, an instrumented chopping board that uses optical fibers and embedded camera imaging to identify unpackaged ingredients during food preparation on its surface. By embedding the sensing directly, and robustly, in the surface of a chopping board we also demonstrate how surface contact optical sensing can be used to realize the portability and privacy required of technology used in a setting such as a domestic kitchen. FoodBoard was subjected to a close to real-world evaluation in which 12 users prepared actual meals. FoodBoard compared favourably with existing unpackaged food recognition systems, classifying a larger number of distinct food ingredients (12 incl. meat, fruit, vegetables) with an average accuracy of 82.8%.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "University of Hasselt", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Post and Teleco ...
