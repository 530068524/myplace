{"title": "Are There Any Nicely Structured Preference Profiles Nearby?", "fields": ["machine learning", "computational complexity theory", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "time complexity", "mathematical optimization", "nice"], "abstract": "We investigate the problem of deciding whether a given preference profile is close to a nicely structured preference profile of a certain type, as for instance single-peaked, single-caved, singlecrossing, value-restricted, best-restricted, worst-restricted, medium-restricted, or group-separable profiles. We measure this distance by the number of voters or alternatives that have to be deleted so as to reach a nicely structured profile. Our results classify all considered problem variants with respect to their computational complexity, and draw a clear line between computationally tractable (polynomial time solvable) and computationally intractable (NP-hard) questions.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Robert Bredereck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bredereck:Robert", "Jiehua Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiehua", "Gerhard J.
