First, we start with a structural relaxation of the original model. We then infer from the relaxation its deficiencies, and compensate for them. This perspective allows us to identify two distinct classes of approximations. First, we find that max-product belief propagation can be viewed as a way to compensate for a relaxation, based on a particular idealized case for exactness. We identify a second approach to compensation that is based on a more refined idealized case, resulting in a new approximation with distinct properties. We go on to propose a new class of algorithms that, starting with a relaxation, iteratively yields tighter approximations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Arthur Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Arthur", "Adnan Darwiche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darwiche:Adnan"], "pages": 9}
