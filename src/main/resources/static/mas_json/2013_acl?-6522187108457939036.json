{"title": "Chinese Parsing Exploiting Characters.", "fields": ["computer science", "syntax", "natural language processing", "artificial intelligence", "parsing"], "abstract": "Characters play an important role in the Chinese language, yet computational processing of Chinese has been dominated by word-based approaches, with leaves in syntax trees being words. We investigate Chinese parsing from the character-level, extending the notion of phrase-structure trees by annotating internal structures of words. We demonstrate the importance of character-level information to Chinese processing by building a joint segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and phrase-structure parsing system that integrates character-structure features. Our joint system significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art word-based baseline on the standard CTB5 test, and gives the best published results for Chinese parsing.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Meishan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Meishan", "Yue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yue", "Wanxiang Che.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Che:Wanxiang", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ting"], "pages": 10}
