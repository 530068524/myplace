{"title": "Autonomous Learning of Action Models for Planning.", "fields": ["polynomial", "concept learning", "planner", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This paper introduces two new frameworks for learning action models for planning. In the mistake-bounded planning framework, the learner has access to a planner for the given model representation, a simulator, and a planning problem generator, and aims to learn a model with at most a polynomial number of faulty plans. In the planned exploration framework, the learner does not have access to a problem generator and must instead design its own problems, plan for them, and converge with at most a polynomial number of planning attempts. The paper reduces learning in these frameworks to concept learning with one-sided error and provides algorithms for successful learning in both frameworks. A specific family of hypothesis spaces is shown to be efficiently learnable in both the frameworks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Neville Mehta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehta:Neville", "Prasad Tadepalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tadepalli:Prasad", "Alan Fern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern:Alan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
