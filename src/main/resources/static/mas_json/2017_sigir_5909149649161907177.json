We develop and release a new version of this test collection, DBpedia-Entity v2, which uses a more recent DBpedia dump and a unified candidate result pool from the same set of retrieval models. Relevance judgments are also collected in a uniform way, using the same group of crowdsourcing workers, following the same assessment guidelines. The result is an up-to-date and consistent test collection.To facilitate further research, we also provide details about the pre-processing and indexing steps, and include baseline results from both classical and recently developed entity search methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Wayne State University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Stavanger", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Faegheh Hasibi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasibi:Faegheh", "Fedor Nikolaev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolaev:Fedor", "Chenyan Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Chenyan", "Krisztian Balog.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balog:Krisztian", "Svein Erik Bratsberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bratsberg:Svein_Erik", "Alexander Kotov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotov:Alexander", "Jamie Callan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Callan:Jamie"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
