The links in a social network often reflect social relationships among users. In this work, we first investigate identifying the relationships among social network users based on certain social network property and limited pre-known information. Social networks have been widely used for online marketing. A critical step is the propagation maximization by choosing a small set of seeds for marketing. Based on the social relationships learned in the first step, we show how to exploit these relationships to maximize the marketing efficacy. We evaluate our approach on large scale real-world data from Renren network, showing that the performances of our relationship classification and propagation maximization algorithm are pretty good in practice.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Nanjing University", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Microsoft Research Asia (China)"], "authors": ["Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie", "Jing Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan_0002:Jing", "XuFei Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:XuFei", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Wei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0013:Wei", "Guojun Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Guojun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
