Since the usual statistical models for radio signals in a propagation environment do not lend themselves easily to a description of the available service rate, the performance analysis of wireless networks has resorted to higher-layer abstractions, e.g., using Markov chain models. In this work, we propose a network calculus that can incorporate common statistical models of fading channels and obtain statistical bounds on delay and backlog across multiple nodes. We conduct the analysis in a transfer domain, which we refer to as the SNR domain, where the service process at a link is characterized by the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. We discover that, in the transfer domain, the network model is governed by a dioid algebra, which we refer to as (min, \u00d7) algebra. Using this algebra we derive the desired delay and backlog bounds. An application of the analysis is demonstrated for a simple multi-hop network with Rayleigh fading channels.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Hussein Al-Zubaidy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Al=Zubaidy:Hussein", "J\u00f6rg Liebeherr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liebeherr:J=ouml=rg", "Almut Burchard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burchard:Almut"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
