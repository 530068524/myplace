{"title": "Integrating adaptive user interface capabilities in enterprise applications.", "fields": ["enterprise systems engineering", "enterprise application integration", "architecture domain", "enterprise integration", "functional software architecture"], "abstract": "Many existing enterprise applications are at a mature stage in their development and are unable to easily benefit from the usability gains offered by adaptive user interfaces (UIs). Therefore, a method is needed for integrating adaptive UI capabilities into these systems without incurring a high cost or significantly disrupting the way they function. This paper presents a method for integrating adaptive UI behavior in enterprise applications based on CEDAR, a model-driven, service-oriented, and tool-supported architecture for devising adaptive enterprise application UIs. The proposed integration method is evaluated with a case study, which includes establishing and applying technical metrics to measure several of the method\u2019s properties using the open-source enterprise application OFBiz as a test-case. The generality and flexibility of the integration method are also evaluated based on an interview and discussions with practitioners about their real-life projects.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Open University", "Open University", "Open University"], "authors": ["Pierre A.
