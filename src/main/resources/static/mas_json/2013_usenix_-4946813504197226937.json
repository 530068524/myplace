{"title": "vTurbo: Accelerating Virtual Machine I/O Processing Using Designated Turbo-Sliced Core.", "fields": ["latency", "preemption", "throughput", "central processing unit", "virtual machine"], "abstract": "In a virtual machine (VM) consolidation environment, it has been observed that CPU sharing among multiple VMs will lead to I/O processing latency because of the CPU access latency experienced by each VM. In this paper, we present vTurbo, a system that accelerates I/O processing for VMs by offloading I/O processing to a designated core. More specifically, the designated core - called turbo core - runs with a much smaller time slice (e.g., 0.1ms) than the cores shared by production VMs. Most of the I/O IRQs for the production VMs will be delegated to the turbo core for more timely processing, hence accelerating the I/O processing for the production VMs. Our experiments show that vTurbo significantly improves the VMs' network and disk I/O throughput, which consequently translates into application-level performance improvement.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Cong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Cong", "Sahan Gamage.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gamage:Sahan", "Hui Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0001:Hui", "Ramana Rao Kompella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kompella:Ramana_Rao", "Dongyan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Dongyan"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
