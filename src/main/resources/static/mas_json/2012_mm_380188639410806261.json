{"title": "El-pincel: a painter cloud service for greener web pages.", "fields": ["oled", "liquid crystal display", "active matrix", "web navigation", "tone mapping"], "abstract": "Due to their thin size, vivid colors, high contrast and power efficiency, OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) display and its variants such as AMOLED (Active Matrix OLED) displays are increasingly replacing traditional LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screens in smart phones. However, the power efficiency of OLED screens greatly depends on the luminance and colors of the displayed contents on the screen. Web browsing is one of the most widely used applications in mobile devices. In this paper, we present our cloud service, which intelligently re-paints the web pages in real-time with power efficient colors and HVS (Human Visual System) based tone mapping techniques, without adversely affecting the identity (brand color) of the web pages as well as the user's browsing experience. El-pincel helps to save up to 60% of OLED energy with color combinations that ensure good legibility and pleasing affective response to human eyes.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Bhojan Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Bhojan", "Lee Kee Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Lee_Kee", "Ee-Chien Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Ee=Chien", "Mun Choon Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Mun_Choon", "Akkihebbal L.
