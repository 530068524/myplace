However, one of the most challenging aspects of RE is the detection of inconsistencies between requirements. To address this issue, we have developed REInDetector, a knowledge-based requirements engineering tool, supporting automatic detection of a range of inconsistencies. It provides facilities to elicit, structure, and manage requirements with distinguished capabilities for capturing the domain knowledge and the semantics of requirements. This permits an automatic analysis of both consistency and realizability of requirements. REInDetector finds implicit consequences of explicit requirements and offers all stakeholders an additional means to identify problems in a more timely fashion than existing RE tools. In this paper, we describe the Description Logic used to capture requirements, the REInDetector tool, its support for inconsistency detection, and its efficacy as applied to several RE examples. An important feature of REInDetector is also its ability to generate comprehensive explanations to provide more insights into the detected inconsistencies.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Tuong Huan Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tuong_Huan", "Bao Quoc Vo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vo:Bao_Quoc", "Markus Lumpe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lumpe:Markus", "John Grundy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grundy_0001:John"], "pages": 4}
