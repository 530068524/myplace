Yet while effective technologies for complex pattern detection on continuous event streams have been developed, the problem of scalable online aggregation of such patterns has been overlooked. Instead, aggregation is typically applied as a post processing step after CEP pattern detection, leading to an extremely ineffective solution. In this paper, we demonstrate that CEP aggregation can be pushed into the sequence construction process. Based on this insight our A-Seq strategy successfully aggregates sequence pattern online without ever constructing sequence matches. This drives down the complexity of the CEP aggregation problem from polynomial to linear. We further extend our A-Seq strategy to support the shared processing of concurrent CEP aggregation queries. The A-Seq solution is shown to achieve over four orders of magnitude performance improvement for a wide range of tested scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art solution.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Google", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yingmei Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Yingmei", "Lei Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Lei", "Medhabi Ray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ray:Medhabi", "Elke A.
