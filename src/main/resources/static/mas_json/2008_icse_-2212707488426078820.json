The aim of this industrial case study is to verify a priori, thus before implementation, certain design issues. The specific scenario is a simplified version of one of possible new services for car drivers to be provided by the in-vehicle computers.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["CNR, Pisa, Italy", "CNR, Pisa, Italy", "Cirquent GmbH, Munich, Germany", "CNR, Pisa, Italy"], "authors": ["Maurice H. ter Beek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beek:Maurice_H=_ter", "Stefania Gnesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gnesi:Stefania", "Nora Koch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koch:Nora", "Franco Mazzanti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazzanti:Franco"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
