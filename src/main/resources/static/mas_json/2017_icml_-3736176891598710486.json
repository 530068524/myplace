{"title": "\"Convex Until Proven Guilty\": Dimension-Free Acceleration of Gradient Descent on Non-Convex Functions.", "fields": ["lipschitz continuity", "hessian matrix", "convex function", "third derivative", "nabla symbol"], "abstract": "We develop and analyze a variant of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (AGD) for minimization of smooth non-convex functions. We prove that one of two cases occurs: either our AGD variant converges quickly, as if the function was convex, or we produce a certificate that the function is \"guilty\" of being non-convex. This non-convexity certificate allows us to exploit negative curvature and obtain deterministic, dimension-free acceleration of convergence for non-convex functions. For a function $f$ with Lipschitz continuous gradient and Hessian, we compute a point $x$ with $\\|\\nabla f(x)\\| \\le \\epsilon$ in $O(\\epsilon^{-7/4} \\log(1/ \\epsilon) )$ gradient and function evaluations. Assuming additionally that the third derivative is Lipschitz, we require only $O(\\epsilon^{-5/3} \\log(1/ \\epsilon) )$ evaluations.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Yair Carmon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carmon:Yair", "John C.
