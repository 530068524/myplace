{"title": "Model Checking Knowledge in Pursuit Evasion Games.", "fields": ["combinatorial game theory", "game mechanics", "complete information", "pursuit evasion", "sequential game"], "abstract": "In a pursuit-evasion game, one or more pursuers aim to discover the existence of, and then capture, an evader. The paper studies pursuit-evasion games in which players may have incomplete information concerning the game state. A methodology is presented for the application of a model checker for the logic of knowledge and time to verify epistemic properties in such games. Experimental results are provided from a number of case studies that validate the feasibility of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "Defence R&D Canada, Quebec"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xiaowei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xiaowei", "Patrick Maupin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maupin:Patrick", "Ron van der Meyden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyden:Ron_van_der"], "pages": 6}
