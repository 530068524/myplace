{"title": "Data Compression for Learning MRF Parameters.", "fields": ["random field", "markov chain", "data compression", "computation", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We propose a technique for decomposing and compressing the dataset in the parameter learning problem in Markov random fields. Our technique applies to incomplete datasets and exploits variables that are always observed in the given dataset. We show that our technique allows exact computation of the gradient and the likelihood, and can lead to orders-of-magnitude savings in learning time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Khaled S.
