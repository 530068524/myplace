The advantages of the utilization of visual attributes are that they can be composed to create descriptions at various levels of specificity or they can be learned once and then applied to recognize new objects or categories. Therefore, attribute prediction becomes an essential problem to boost image understanding. This paper proposes an approach for correlated attribute transfer from a well-defined source image set to an uncontrolled target image set for attribute prediction. We call it correlated attribute transfer with multi-task graph-guided fusion (CAT-MtG 2 F). The novelty of CAT-MtG 2 F is to encourage highly correlated attributes to share a common set of relevant low-level features and transfer the learned common structure from the source image set to the target image set. The experiments show that the proposed CAT-MtG 2 F achieves better performance in attribute prediction.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Tianjin University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "University of Texas at San Antonio", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Yahong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Yahong", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Xinyan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Xinyan", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting", "Jiebo Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jiebo"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
