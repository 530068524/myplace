{"title": "CrowdFill: collecting structured data from the crowd.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "latency", "synchronization", "data model", "data collection"], "abstract": "We present CrowdFill, a system for collecting structured data from the crowd. While a typical microtask-based approach would pose specific questions to each worker and assemble the answers, CrowdFill shows a partially-filled table to all participating workers. Workers contribute by filling in empty cells, as well as upvoting and downvoting data entered by other workers. The system's synchronization scheme, based on a careful model of primitive operations, enables workers to collaboratively complete the table without latency overhead. CrowdFill allows the specification of constraints on the collected data, and has mechanisms for resolving inconsistencies. Its compensation scheme takes into account each worker's contribution to the final table, and the varying difficulty of data entry tasks. The paper includes some preliminary experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Hyunjung Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park_0001:Hyunjung", "Jennifer Widom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widom:Jennifer"], "pages": 12}
