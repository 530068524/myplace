{"title": "Transferable Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation.", "fields": ["deep learning", "segmentation", "pattern recognition", "scalability", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The performance of deep learning based semantic segmentation models heavily depends on sufficient data with careful annotations. However, even the largest public datasets only provide samples with pixel-level annotations for rather limited semantic categories. Such data scarcity critically limits scalability and applicability of semantic segmentation models in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel transferable semi-supervised semantic segmentation model that can transfer the learned segmentation knowledge from a few strong categories with pixel-level annotations to unseen weak categories with only image-level annotations, significantly broadening the applicable territory of deep segmentation models. In particular, the proposed model consists of two complementary and learnable components: a Label transfer Network (L-Net) and a Prediction transfer Network (P-Net). The L-Net learns to transfer the segmentation knowledge from strong categories to the images in the weak categories and produces coarse pixel-level semantic maps, by effectively exploiting the similar appearance shared across categories. Meanwhile, the P-Net tailors the transferred knowledge through a carefully designed adversarial learning strategy and produces refined segmentation results with better details. Integrating the L-Net and P-Net achieves 96.5% and 89.4% performance of the fully-supervised baseline using 50% and 0% categories with pixel-level annotations respectively on PASCAL VOC 2012. With such a novel transfer mechanism, our proposed model is easily generalizable to a variety of new categories, only requiring image-level annotations, and offers appealing scalability in real applications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Huaxin Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Huaxin", "Yunchao Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Yunchao", "Yu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0008:Yu", "Maojun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Maojun", "Jiashi Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jiashi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
