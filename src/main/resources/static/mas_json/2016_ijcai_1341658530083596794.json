{"title": "Robust Domain Generalisation by Enforcing Distribution Invariance.", "fields": ["invariant", "subspace topology", "activity recognition", "generalization", "kernel"], "abstract": "Many conventional statistical machine learning algorithms generalise poorly if distribution bias exists in the datasets. For example, distribution bias arises in the context of domain generalisation, where knowledge acquired from multiple source domains need to be used in a previously unseen target domains. We propose  Elliptical Summary Randomisation (ESRand) , an efficient domain generalisation approach that comprises of a randomised kernel and elliptical data summarisation. ESRand learns a domain interdependent projection to a latent subspace that minimises the existing biases to the data while maintaining the functional relationship between domains. In the latent subspace, ellipsoidal summaries replace the samples to enhance the generalisation by further removing bias and noise in the data. Moreover, the summarisation enables large-scale data processing by significantly reducing the size of the data. Through comprehensive analysis, we show that our subspace-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art results on several activity recognition benchmark datasets, while keeping the computational complexity significantly low.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "Queensland University of Technology", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Sarah M.
