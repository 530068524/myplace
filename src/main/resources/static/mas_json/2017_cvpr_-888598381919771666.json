{"title": "A Multi-view Stereo Benchmark with High-Resolution Images and Multi-camera Videos.", "fields": ["laser scanning", "image resolution", "benchmark", "ranging", "mobile device"], "abstract": "Motivated by the limitations of existing multi-view stereo benchmarks, we present a novel dataset for this task. Towards this goal, we recorded a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes using a high-precision laser scanner and captured both high-resolution DSLR imagery as well as synchronized low-resolution stereo videos with varying fields-of-view. To align the images with the laser scans, we propose a robust technique which minimizes photometric errors conditioned on the geometry. In contrast to previous datasets, our benchmark provides novel challenges and covers a diverse set of viewpoints and scene types, ranging from natural scenes to man-made indoor and outdoor environments. Furthermore, we provide data at significantly higher temporal and spatial resolution. Our benchmark is the first to cover the important use case of hand-held mobile devices while also providing high-resolution DSLR camera images. We make our datasets and an online evaluation server available at http://www.eth3d.net.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Thomas Sch\u00f6ps.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=ps:Thomas", "Johannes L.
