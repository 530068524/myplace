However, as it is currently formulated, PLSA strictly requires the number of word latent classes to be equal to the number of document latent classes. In this paper, we propose Bi-mixture PLSA, a new formulation of PLSA that allows the number of latent word classes to be different from the number of latent document classes. We further extend Bi-mixture PLSA to incorporate the sentence information, and propose Bi-mixture PLSA with sentence bases (Bi-PLSAS) to simultaneously cluster and summarize the documents utilizing the mutual influence of the document clustering and summarization procedures. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Florida International University", "Florida International University", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Chao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chao", "Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Tao", "Chris H.
