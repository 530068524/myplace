However, live broadcasting and user interaction do not coexist in existing FTV systems. In this paper, we propose F.Live, a framework of FTV content dissemination that supports user-initiated viewpoint changing for live broadcasting. Simulation result of a large-scale experiment, based on camera array settings of existing Nagoya systems and EyeVision System, shows that F.Live is capable of supporting 100,000 concurrent audiences with free-viewpoint low user interaction latency and feasible bandwidth requirements.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Chien-Nan (Shannon) Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chien=Nan_=Shannon=", "Zhenhuan Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Zhenhuan", "Klara Nahrstedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nahrstedt:Klara"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
