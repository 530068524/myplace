{"title": "From checking on to checking in: designing for low socio-economic status older adults.", "fields": ["socioeconomic status", "human computer interaction", "peer production", "software deployment", "aging in place"], "abstract": "In this paper we describe the design evolution of a novel technology that collects and displays presence information to be used in the homes of older adults. The first two iterations, the Ambient Plant and Presence Clock, were designed for higher socio-economic status (SES) older adults, whereas the Check-In Tree was designed for low SES older adults. We describe how feedback from older adult participants drove our design decisions, and give an in-depth account of how the Check-In Tree evolved from concept to a final design ready for in situ deployment.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Clemson University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ingrid Arreola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arreola:Ingrid", "Zan Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Zan", "Matthew Francisco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Francisco:Matthew", "Kay Connelly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Connelly:Kay", "Kelly E.
