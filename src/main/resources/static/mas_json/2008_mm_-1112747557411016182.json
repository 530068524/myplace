In this paper, we present a fast, accurate and highly scalable image fingerprinting technique suited for near-duplicate detection at the web-scale. The image fingerprint is a compact 130 bit representation computed using Fourier-Mellin transform. Near-duplicate images are detected in O(1) time using fingerprint equality and is faster than fast approximate near-neighbor searches like LSH.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["S.
