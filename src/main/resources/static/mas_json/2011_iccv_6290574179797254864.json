In this paper we develop a new method for reducing the computational time and improving numerical stability of algorithms using this method. To achieve this, we propose and prove a set of algebraic conditions which allow us to reduce the size of the elimination template (polynomial coefficient matrix), which leads to faster LU or QR decomposition. Our technique is generic and has potential to improve performance of many solvers that use the action matrix method. We demonstrate the approach on specific examples, including an image stitching algorithm where computation time is halved and single precision arithmetic can be used.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Oleg Naroditsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naroditsky:Oleg", "Kostas Daniilidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daniilidis:Kostas"], "pages": 8}
