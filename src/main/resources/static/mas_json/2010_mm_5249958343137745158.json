Unlike current methods available to music therapists (e.g., personal CD/MP3 library search) we propose a domain-specific search engine that utilizes database of music found on YouTube. We independently evaluate the efficacy of our tempo, cultural, and beat strength features on a music database extracted from YouTube. Results from our user study demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our search engine for this application.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "McGill University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Zhonghua Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhonghua", "Qiaoliang Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Qiaoliang", "Jason Hockman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hockman:Jason", "Jianqing Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jianqing", "Yu Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Yu", "Ichiro Fujinaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujinaga:Ichiro", "Ye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ye"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
