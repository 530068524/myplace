In this work, we report an extensible framework to facilitate symbolic encoding and checking of hierarchical systems. Firstly, a novel library of symbolic encoding functions for compositional operators (e.g., parallel composition, sequential composition, choice operator, etc.) are developed so that users can apply symbolic model checking techniques to hierarchical systems with little knowledge of symbolic encoding techniques (like BDD or CUDD). Secondly, as the library is language-independent, we build an extensible framework with various symbolic model checking algorithms so that the library can be easily applied to encode and verify different modeling languages. Lastly, the applicability and scalability of our framework are demonstrated by applying the framework in the development of symbolic model checkers for three modeling languages as well as a comparison with the NuSMV model checker.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Truong Khanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Truong_Khanh", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Yang", "Jin Song Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jin_Song"], "pages": 4}
