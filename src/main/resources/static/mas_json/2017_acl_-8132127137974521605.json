{"title": "Ontology-Aware Token Embeddings for Prepositional Phrase Attachment.", "fields": ["phrase", "security token", "noun phrase", "ambiguity", "wordnet"], "abstract": "Type-level word embeddings use the same set of parameters to represent all instances of a word regardless of its context, ignoring the inherent lexical ambiguity in language. Instead, we embed semantic concepts (or synsets) as defined in WordNet and represent a word token in a particular context by estimating a distribution over relevant semantic concepts. We use the new, context-sensitive embeddings in a model for predicting prepositional phrase(PP) attachments and jointly learn the concept embeddings and model parameters. We show that using context-sensitive embeddings improves the accuracy of the PP attachment model by 5.4% absolute points, which amounts to a 34.4% relative reduction in errors.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Pradeep Dasigi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasigi:Pradeep", "Waleed Ammar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ammar:Waleed", "Chris Dyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dyer:Chris", "Eduard H.
