REG can be implemented such that each graph is generated in expected time $O(nd^3)$, provided that $d=o(\\sqrt{n})$. Our result significantly improves the previously best uniform sampler, which works efficiently only when $d=O(n^{1/3})$, with essentially the same running time for the same $d$. We also give a linear-time approximate sampler REG*, which generates a random $d$-regular graph whose distribution differs from the uniform by $o(1)$ in total variation distance, when $d=o(\\sqrt{n})$.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Monash University", "Sch of Mathematical Sciences", "Sch of Mathematical Sciences"], "authors": ["Pu Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Pu", "Nicholas C.
