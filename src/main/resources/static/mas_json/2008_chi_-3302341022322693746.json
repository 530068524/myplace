As with any rapid motor act, faster pointing movements result in increased errors. But although prior work has examined accuracy as the \"spread of hits,\" no work has formulated a predictive model for error rates (0-100%) based on Fitts' law parameters. We show that Fitts' law mathematically implies a predictive error rate model, which we derive. We then describe an experiment in which target size, target distance, and movement time are manipulated. Our results show a strong model fit: a regression analysis of observed vs. predicted error rates yields a correlation of  R  2 =.959 for  N =90 points. Furthermore, we show that the effect on error rate of target size ( W ) is greater than that of target distance ( A ), indicating a departure from Fitts' law, which maintains that W and A contribute proportionally to index of difficulty ( ID ). Our error model can be used with Fitts' law to estimate and predict error rates along with speeds, providing a framework for unifying this dichotomy.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "York University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jacob O.
