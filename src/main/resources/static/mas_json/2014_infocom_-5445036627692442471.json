We aim to maximize the packet delivery reliability while meeting the deadline for each packet. The transmission scheduling prob- lem is decomposed into two sub-problems: subperiod-based slot allocation and slot-based transmission scheduling. The former sub-problem is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem, and we present a solution with polynomial-time com- plexity by converting it to a linear integer programming problem. For the latter sub-problem, we demonstrate that the existence of a feasible optimal schedule depends on the order of the elements in the slot allocation vector produced by solving the former sub- problem. An algorithm is designed to compute a feasible slot allocation that sustains a realizable schedule. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme ensures each device has almost the same packet delivery rate in different report periods, which is important for maintaining the stability of control systems.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Otago", "University of Otago", "University of Otago", "University of Otago"], "authors": ["Yan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yan", "Haibo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Haibo", "Zhiyi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Zhiyi", "Michael Albert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albert:Michael"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
