{"title": "Path Stitching: Internet-Wide Path and Delay Estimation from Existing Measurements.", "fields": ["image stitching", "real time computing", "the internet", "computer network", "user experience design"], "abstract": "Many measurement systems have been proposed in recent years to shed light on the internal performance of the Internet. Their common goal is to allow distributed applications to improve end-user experience. A common hurdle they face is the need to deploy yet another measurement infrastructure. In this work, we demonstrate that without any new measurement infrastructure or active probing we obtain composite performance estimates from AS-by-AS segments and the estimates are as good as (or even better than) those from existing estimation methodologies that use on-demand, customized active probing. The main contribution of this paper is an estimation algorithm that breaks down measurement data into segments, identifies relevant segments efficiently, and, by carefully stitching segments together, produces delay and path estimates between any two end points. Fittingly, we call our algorithm path stitching. Our results show remarkably good accuracy: error in delay is below 20 ms in 80% of end-to-end paths.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["D.
