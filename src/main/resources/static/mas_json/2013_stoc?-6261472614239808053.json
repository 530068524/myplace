This is a rich class of queries that includes contingency tables and range queries and has been the focus of a long line of work. For a given set of d linear queries over a database x \u2208 R N , we seek to find the differentially private mechanism that has the minimum mean squared error. For pure differential privacy, [5, 32] give an O(log 2  d) approximation to the optimal mechanism. Our first contribution is to give an efficient O(log 2  d) approximation guarantee for the case of (e,\u03b4)-differential privacy. Our mechanism adds carefully chosen correlated Gaussian noise to the answers. We prove its approximation guarantee relative to the  hereditary discrepancy  lower bound of [44], using tools from convex geometry. We next consider the sparse case when the number of queries exceeds the number of individuals in the database, i.e. when d > n \u0394 |x| 1 . The lower bounds used in the previous approximation algorithm no longer apply --- in fact better mechanisms are known in this setting [7, 27, 28, 31, 49]. Our second main contribution is to give an efficient (e,\u03b4)-differentially private mechanism that, for any given query set A and an upper bound n on |x| 1 , has mean squared error within polylog(d,N) of the optimal for A and n. This approximation is achieved by coupling the Gaussian noise addition approach with linear regression over the l 1  ball. Additionally, we show a similar polylogarithmic approximation guarantee for the optimal e-differentially private mechanism in this sparse setting. Our work also shows that for arbitrary counting queries, i.e. A with entries in {0,1}, there is an e-differentially private mechanism with expected error ~O(\u221an) per query, improving on the ~O(n 2/3 ) bound of [7] and matching the lower bound implied by [15] up to logarithmic factors.   The connection between the hereditary discrepancy and the privacy mechanism enables us to derive the first polylogarithmic approximation to the hereditary discrepancy of a matrix A.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Aleksandar Nikolov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolov:Aleksandar", "Kunal Talwar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talwar:Kunal", "Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Li"], "pages": 10}
