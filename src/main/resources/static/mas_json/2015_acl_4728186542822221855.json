Using the class of hidden Markov models (HMMs) underlying Brown clustering as a generative model, we demonstrate how canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and certain count transformations permit efficient and effective recovery of model parameters with lexical semantics. We further show in experiments that these techniques empirically outperform existing spectral methods on word similarity and analogy tasks, and are also competitive with other popular methods such as WORD2VEC and GLOVE.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Karl Stratos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stratos:Karl", "Michael Collins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collins_0001:Michael", "Daniel J.
