{"title": "Report from the NTCIR-10 1CLICK-2 Japanese subtask: baselines, upperbounds and evaluation robustness.", "fields": ["robustness", "web page", "search engine", "baseline", "leverage"], "abstract": "The One Click Access Task (1CLICK) of NTCIR requires systems to return a concise multi-document summary of web pages in response to a query which is assumed to have been submitted in a mobile context. Systems are evaluated based on information units (or iUnits), and are required to present important pieces of information first and to minimise the amount of text the user has to read. Using the official Japanese results of the second round of the 1CLICK task from NTCIR-10, we discuss our task setting and evaluation framework. Our analyses show that: (1) Simple baseline methods that leverage search engine snippets or Wikipedia are effective for 'lookup' type queries but not necessarily for other query types; (2) There is still a substantial gap between manual and automatic runs; and (3) Our evaluation metrics are relatively robust to the incompleteness of iUnits.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "Microsoft", "Kyoto University", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Makoto P.
