In this paper, we focus on the activity of small human group, which involves countable persons and complex interactions. To cope with the variant number of participants and inherent interactions within the activity, we propose a hierarchical model with three layers to depict the characteristics at different granularities. In traditional methods, group activity is represented mainly based on motion information, such as human trajectories, but ignoring discriminative appearance information, e.g. the rough sketch of a pose style. In our approach, we take advantage of both the motion and the appearance information in the spatiotemporal activity context under the hierarchical model. These features are inhomogeneous. Therefore, we employ multiple kernel learning methods to fuse the features for group activity recognition. Experiments on a surveillance-like human group activity database demonstrate the validity of our approach and the recognition performance is promising.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Zhongwei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Zhongwei", "Lei Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Lei", "Qingming Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Qingming", "Shuqiang Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Shuqiang", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
