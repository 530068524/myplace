In this paper, we present a Group Based Event Detection method, called GBED, to detect the audio events in the audio sensor networks. In the proposed method, we train the basic audio events separately based on statistical learning, and combine them together by some prior knowledge in specific domains. By using GBED we can combine the statistical learning and human knowledge together and reduce the training complexity for complex real-world situations. We deploy this approach on an audio sensor network to evaluate its performance, and the experiment evaluations demonstrate that GBED can achieve satisfied results.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Beijing Key Lab ...
