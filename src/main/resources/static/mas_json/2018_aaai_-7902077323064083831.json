{"title": "DID: Distributed Incremental Block Coordinate Descent for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization.", "fields": ["coordinate descent", "non negative matrix factorization", "correctness", "distributed memory", "scalability"], "abstract": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has attracted much attention in the last decade as a dimension reduction method in many applications. Due to the explosion in the size of data, naturally the samples are collected and stored distributively in local computational nodes. Thus, there is a growing need to develop algorithms in a distributed memory architecture. We propose a novel distributed algorithm, called \\textit{distributed incremental block coordinate descent} (DID), to solve the problem. By adapting the block coordinate descent framework, closed-form update rules are obtained in DID. Moreover, DID performs updates incrementally based on the most recently updated residual matrix. As a result, only one communication step per iteration is required. The correctness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed algorithm are verified in a series of numerical experiments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Tianxiang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Tianxiang", "Chris Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Chris"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
