It is highly memory efficient and allows for random access at near dense vector level rates. This allows us to solve sparse l 1  programming problems  exactly  and  without preprocessing  at a cost that is identical to dense linear algebra both in terms of memory and speed. Our approach provides a feasible alternative to the hash kernel and it excels whenever exact solutions are required, such as for feature selection.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Li Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Li", "David G.
