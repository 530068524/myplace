{"title": "Impact of flow-level dynamics on QoE of video streaming in wireless networks.", "fields": ["quality of experience", "throughput", "fading", "base station", "upload"], "abstract": "The Quality of Experience (QoE) of streaming service is often degraded by frequent playback interruptions. To mitigate the interruptions, the media player prefetches streaming contents before starting playback, at a cost of delay. We study the QoE of streaming from the perspective of flow dynamics. First, a framework is developed for QoE when streaming users join the network randomly and leave after downloading completion. We compute the distribution of prefetching delay using partial differential equations (PDEs), and the probability generating function of playout buffer starvations using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Second, we extend our framework to characterize the throughput variation caused by opportunistic scheduling at the base station in the presence of fast fading. Our study reveals that the flow dynamics is the fundamental reason of playback starvation. The QoE of streaming service is dominated by the average throughput of opportunistic scheduling, while the variance of throughput has very limited impact on starvation behavior.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Avignon", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Avignon", "Orange Labs., I ... lineaux, France"], "authors": ["Yuedong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yuedong", "Salah-Eddine Elayoubi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elayoubi:Salah=Eddine", "Eitan Altman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altman:Eitan", "Rachid El Azouzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azouzi:Rachid_El"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
