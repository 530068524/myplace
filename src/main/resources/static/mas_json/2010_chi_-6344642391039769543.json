This diversity is measured at two levels: the concepts that are included in each edition and the ways in which these concepts are described. We demonstrate that the diversity present is greater than has been presumed in the literature and has a significant influence on applications that use Wikipedia as a source of world knowledge. We close by explicating how knowledge diversity can be beneficially leveraged to create \"culturally-aware applications\" and \"hyperlingual applications\".", "citation": "Citations (130)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Brent J.
