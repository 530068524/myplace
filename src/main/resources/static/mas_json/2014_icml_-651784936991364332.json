Whereas most existing measures can only detect pairwise correlations between two dimensions, modern analysis aims at detecting correlations in multi-dimensional spaces.\n\nWe propose MAC, a novel multivariate correlation measure designed for discovering multi-dimensional patterns. It belongs to the powerful class of maximal correlation analysis, for which we propose a generalization to multivariate domains. We highlight the limitations of current methods in this class, and address these with MAC. Our experiments show that MAC outperforms existing solutions, is robust to noise, and discovers interesting and useful patterns.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "University of Antwerp", "Max Planck Society", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Hoang Vu Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hoang_Vu", "Emmanuel M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Emmanuel", "Jilles Vreeken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vreeken:Jilles", "Pavel Efros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efros:Pavel", "Klemens B\u00f6hm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hm:Klemens"], "pages": 9}
