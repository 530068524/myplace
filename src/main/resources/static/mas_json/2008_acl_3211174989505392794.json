{"title": "Automatic Syllabification with Structured SVMs for Letter-to-Phoneme Conversion.", "fields": ["syllabification", "machine learning", "support vector machine", "discriminative model", "word error rate"], "abstract": "We present the first English syllabification system to improve the accuracy of letter-tophoneme conversion. We propose a novel discriminative approach to automatic syllabification based on structured SVMs. In comparison with a state-of-the-art syllabification system, we reduce the syllabification word error rate for English by 33%. Our approach also performs well on other languages, comparing favorably with published results on German and Dutch.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Susan Bartlett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartlett:Susan", "Grzegorz Kondrak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kondrak:Grzegorz", "Colin Cherry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherry:Colin"], "pages": 9}
