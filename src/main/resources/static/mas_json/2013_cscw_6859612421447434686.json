{"title": "Trust in online news: comparing social media and official media use by chinese citizens.", "fields": ["citizen media", "news media", "citizen journalism", "media relations", "dissemination"], "abstract": "Since 2006 social media use has grown dramatically in China. Social media has become a stage for citizens to report and disseminate news and to vocalize viewpoints, at times competing with reports from highly curated official media sources. These competing news channels, oftentimes presenting contradictory information, raise questions about citizens' trust in these different media. This study explores the level of trust Chinese Internet users place on news from social media versus official media. We conducted a large-scale anonymous survey in China that revealed that official and citizen news attract different audience groups and each group uses different features to assess news trustworthiness. We present a model for predicting preference for news from citizen media. The results reveal features of social media that explain why some citizens trust it as a channel for news. The results also suggest that in highly regulated news environments, citizen media has the potential to become an alternative news channel where citizens can trust each other for information.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Yiran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yiran", "Gloria Mark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mark:Gloria"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
