{"title": "Large-Scale Video Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks.", "fields": ["retraining", "convolutional neural network", "baseline", "time domain", "architecture"], "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been established as a powerful class of models for image recognition problems. Encouraged by these results, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation of CNNs on large-scale video classification using a new dataset of 1 million YouTube videos belonging to 487 classes. We study multiple approaches for extending the connectivity of a CNN in time domain to take advantage of local spatio-temporal information and suggest a multiresolution, foveated architecture as a promising way of speeding up the training. Our best spatio-temporal networks display significant performance improvements compared to strong feature-based baselines (55.3% to 63.9%), but only a surprisingly modest improvement compared to single-frame models (59.3% to 60.9%). We further study the generalization performance of our best model by retraining the top layers on the UCF-101 Action Recognition dataset and observe significant performance improvements compared to the UCF-101 baseline model (63.3% up from 43.9%).", "citation": "Citations (2,403)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Andrej Karpathy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karpathy:Andrej", "George Toderici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toderici:George", "Sanketh Shetty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shetty:Sanketh", "Thomas Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Thomas", "Rahul Sukthankar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sukthankar:Rahul", "Fei-Fei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fei=Fei"], "pages": 8}
