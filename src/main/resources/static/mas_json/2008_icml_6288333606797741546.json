We point out that the key for addressing the learning problem is to look at it from the viewpoint of  query . We define a number of new concepts, including query-level loss, query-level risk, and query-level stability. We then analyze the generalization ability of learning to rank algorithms by giving query-level generalization bounds to them using query-level stability as a tool. Such an analysis is very helpful for us to derive more advanced algorithms for IR. We apply the proposed theory to the existing algorithms of Ranking SVM and IRSVM. Experimental results on the two algorithms verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Microsoft", "Tsinghua University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yanyan Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Yanyan", "Tie-Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tie=Yan", "Tao Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Tao", "Zhiming Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Zhiming", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Hang"], "pages": 8}
