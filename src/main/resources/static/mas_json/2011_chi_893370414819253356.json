In response, parts are replaced and software is updated. Yet  restoration  - the process of returning something to a previous condition, often regardless of its instrumental value -\"is a relatively rare practice with computational technologies. The aim of this paper is to enrich HCI design practices by considering the material qualities of restoration. We consider what makes a technology worth restoring and what constitutes the process of restoration by examining data collected from a three-month apprenticeship-based qualitative study of bookbinding. Building on relevant literatures, we offer antiquarian books -\"long-established information technologies - as a lens onto the ways values are enacted through material engagements. We conclude with a discussion of restoration's role in HCI.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniela K.
