We show that in this case the decipherment problem is equivalent to the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). To the best of our knowledge, this connection between the QAP and the decipherment problem has not been known in the literature before.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Malte Nuhn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nuhn:Malte", "Hermann Ney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ney:Hermann"], "pages": 7}
