{"title": "Static extraction of program configuration options.", "fields": ["source lines of code", "system software", "exploit", "small number", "configuration management"], "abstract": "Many programs use a key-value model for configuration options. We examined how this model is used in seven open source Java projects totaling over a million lines of code. We present a static analysis that extracts a list of configuration options for a program. Our analysis finds 95% of the options read by the programs in our sample, making it more complete than existing documentation.   Most configuration options we saw fall into a small number of types. A dozen types cover 90% of options. We present a second analysis that exploits this fact, inferring a type for most options. Together, these analyses enable more visibility into program configuration, helping reduce the burden of configuration documentation and configuration debugging.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Ariel Rabkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabkin:Ariel", "Randy H.
