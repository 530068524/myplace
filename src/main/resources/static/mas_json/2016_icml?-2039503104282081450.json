The performances of this algorithm (as well as another one motivated by the conjectured optimal bound) are evaluated empirically. A similar analysis is provided with full information, to serve as a benchmark.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Paris Diderot University", "ENSAE ParisTech"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["R\u00e9my Degenne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Degenne:R=eacute=my", "Vianney Perchet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perchet:Vianney"], "pages": 9}
