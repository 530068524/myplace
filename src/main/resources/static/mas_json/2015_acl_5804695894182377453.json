We systematically evaluate various techniques to generate the semantic representations and demonstrate that they are effective to improve the generalization performance of a tree kernel-based relation extractor across domains (up to 7% relative improvement). In addition, we compare the tree kernel-based and the feature-based method for RE in a compatible way, on the same resources and settings, to gain insights into which kind of system is more robust to domain changes. Our results and error analysis shows that the tree kernel-based method outperforms the feature-based approach.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["New York University", "University of Copenhagen", "New York University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Thien Huu Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Thien_Huu", "Barbara Plank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plank:Barbara", "Ralph Grishman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grishman:Ralph"], "pages": 10}
