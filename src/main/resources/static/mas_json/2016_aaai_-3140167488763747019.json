With recent advances in social networks, more people use online resources to plan their future trips. In this paper we explore the application of Wikipedia usage trends (WUTs) in tourism analysis. We propose a framework that deploys WUTs for forecasting the tourism demand of Hawaii. We also propose a data-driven approach, using WUTs, to estimate the behavior of tourists when they plan their trips.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Pejman Khadivi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khadivi:Pejman", "Naren Ramakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramakrishnan:Naren"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 6}
