The instantaneous geometry of the observed scene is represented by a polyhedral mesh with fixed topology. The initial mesh is constructed in the first frame using the publicly available PMVS software for multi-view stereo [7]. Its deformation is captured by tracking its vertices over time, using two optimization processes at each frame: a local one using a rigid motion model in the neighborhood of each vertex, and a global one using a regularized nonrigid model for the whole mesh. Qualitative and quantitative experiments using seven real datasets show that our algorithm effectively handles complex nonrigid motions and severe occlusions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yasutaka Furukawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furukawa:Yasutaka", "Jean Ponce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponce:Jean"], "pages": -1}
