In order to find important features of information resumption behaviors, we conducted a user experiment and modeled information resumption behaviors using machine learning. The model of C5.0 Decision Tree outperformed and showed that features of FamiliarityScores, AveEditDistance, AveQueryEffectiveRate and ValidClickRate are of importance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Wuhan University", "Wuhan University", "Wuhan University"], "authors": ["Dan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Dan", "Jing Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jing", "Yuan Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Yuan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
