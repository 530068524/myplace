{"title": "Efficient minimal-surface regularization of perspective depth maps in variational stereo.", "fields": ["regularization", "minimal surface", "surface reconstruction", "ambiguity", "reconstruction algorithm"], "abstract": "We propose a method for dense three-dimensional surface reconstruction that leverages the strengths of shape-based approaches, by imposing regularization that respects the geometry of the surface, and the strength of depth-map-based stereo, by avoiding costly computation of surface topology. The result is a near real-time variational reconstruction algorithm free of the staircasing artifacts that affect depth-map and plane-sweeping approaches. This is made possible by exploiting the gauge ambiguity to design a novel representation of the regularizer that is linear in the parameters and hence amenable to be optimized with state-of-the-art primal-dual numerical schemes.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Gottfried Graber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graber:Gottfried", "Jonathan Balzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balzer:Jonathan", "Stefano Soatto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soatto:Stefano", "Thomas Pock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pock:Thomas"], "pages": 10}
