But the observation of a continuous quantity usually has probability zero, in which case Bayes\u00e2  s rule says only that the unknown times zero is zero. To infer a posterior distribution from a zero-probability observation, the statistical notion of  disintegration  tells us to specify the observation as an expression rather than a predicate, but does not tell us how to compute the posterior. We present the first method of computing a disintegration from a probabilistic program and an expression of a quantity to be observed, even when the observation has probability zero. Because the method produces an exact posterior term and preserves a semantics in which monadic terms denote measures, it composes with other inference methods in a modular way\u00e2  without sacrificing accuracy or performance.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Indiana University", "Tufts University"], "authors": ["Chung-chieh Shan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shan:Chung=chieh", "Norman Ramsey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramsey:Norman"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 15}
