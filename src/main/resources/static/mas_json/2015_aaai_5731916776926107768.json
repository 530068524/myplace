We ran three studies designed to investigate the impact of user and task characteristics on user performance and satisfaction in different visualization contexts. Eye-tracking data collected in each study was analyzed to uncover possible interactions between user/task characteristics and gaze behavior during visualization processing. Finally, we investigated user models that can assess user characteristics relevant for adaptation from eye tracking data.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Cristina Conati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conati:Cristina", "Giuseppe Carenini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carenini:Giuseppe", "Dereck Toker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toker:Dereck", "S\u00e9bastien Lall\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lall=eacute=:S=eacute=bastien"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
