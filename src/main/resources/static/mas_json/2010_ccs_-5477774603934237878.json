{"title": "On the (in)security of IPsec in MAC-then-encrypt configurations.", "fields": ["encryption", "ipsec", "traffic flow", "secure communication", "security parameter index"], "abstract": "IPsec allows a huge amount of flexibility in the ways in which its component cryptographic mechanisms can be combined to build a secure communications service. This may be good for supporting different security requirements but is potentially bad for security. We demonstrate the reality of this by describing efficient, plaintext-recovering attacks against all configurations of IPsec in which integrity protection is applied {\\em prior} to encryption -- so-called MAC-then-encrypt configurations. We report on the implementation of our attacks against a specific IPsec implementation, and reflect on the implications of our attacks for real-world IPsec deployments as well as for theoretical cryptography.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Royal Holloway, University of London", "Royal Holloway, University of London"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Jean Paul Degabriele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Degabriele:Jean_Paul", "Kenneth G.
