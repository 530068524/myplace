{"title": "First Person View Video Summarization Subject to the User Needs.", "fields": ["usability", "multi document summarization", "compromise", "semantic query", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "Our life is becoming heavily documented and expressed on the digital substrate. This booming flow of consumer video has lead to an increasing demand of multimedia analysis tools to organize and summarize those visual memories. Due to the personal nature of such videos, though, the summarization needs to be adapted to the user needs and preferences. Yet, most summarization systems rely solely on pre-defined criteria, e.g. story-coherence or interestingness pre-trained classifiers. I propose a system which is capable of finding relevant digital memories to a given semantic query, and then summarize them on a customized manner. The proposed framework includes a wide set of tools to match a user's needs, from retrieval using multimodal queries to summarization striving to his/her preferences, both provided passively and actively. Preliminary results show the high potential of such a framework, with over 70% retrieval accuracy. More importantly, as seen from the user study, the summaries generated achieve an unprecedented compromise between usability and quality.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Ana Garcia del Molino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Molino:Ana_Garcia_del"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 5}
