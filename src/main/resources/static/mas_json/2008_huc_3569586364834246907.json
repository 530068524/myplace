While these projects have generated important insights into coordination and communication, we think they overlook the more spontaneous and opportunistic activities that surround and support the scheduled ones. Using data from our mixed-methods study of notebook and ultra-mobile PC use, we argue for a different perspective based on a metaphor of 'plastic'. 'Plastic' captures the way technologies, specifically computers, have integrated into the heterogeneous rhythms of daily life. Plastic technologies harmonize with and support daily life by filling opportunistic gaps, shrinking and expanding until interrupted, not demanding conscious coordination, supporting multitasking, and by deferring to external contingencies.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Tye Rattenbury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rattenbury:Tye", "Dawn Nafus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nafus:Dawn", "Kenneth T.
