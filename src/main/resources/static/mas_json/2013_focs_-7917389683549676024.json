Let suc(\u03bc, f, C) denote the maximum success probability of a 2-party communication protocol for computing the boolean function f(x, y) with C bits of communication, when the inputs (x, y) are drawn from the distribution \u03bc. Let \u03bc n  be the product distribution on n inputs and f n  denote the function that computes n copies of f on these inputs. We prove that if T log 3/2  T \u226a (C - 1)\u221an and suc(\u03bc, f, C)  n , f n , T) \u2264 exp(-\u03a9(n)). When \u03bc is a product distribution, we prove a nearly optimal result: as long as T log 2  T \u226a Cn, we must have suc(\u03bc n , f n , T) \u2264 exp(-\u03a9(n)).", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of Washington", "Princeton University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Mark Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Mark", "Anup Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Anup", "Omri Weinstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weinstein:Omri", "Amir Yehudayoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yehudayoff:Amir"], "pages": 10}
