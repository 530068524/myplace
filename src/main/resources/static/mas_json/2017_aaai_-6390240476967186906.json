To improve the generalization performance, in this paper, we propose Doubly Regularized Multi-Label learning (DRML) by exploiting feature network and label network regularization simultaneously. In more details, the proposed algorithm first constructs a feature network and a label network with marginalized linear denoising autoencoder in data feature set and label set, respectively, and then learns a robust predictor with the feature network and the label network regularization simultaneously. While DRML is a general method for multi-label learning, in the evaluations we focus on the specific application of multi-label text tagging. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that DRML outstands with a superior performance in comparison with some existing multi-label learning methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Yingming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingming", "Ming Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ming", "Zenglin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zenglin", "Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongfei_=Mark="], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
