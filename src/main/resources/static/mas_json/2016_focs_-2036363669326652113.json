For constant \u0394, previous work of Weitz (2006) established an FPTAS for the partition function for graphs of maximum degree \u0394 when \u03bb\u03bbc(\u0394). The threshold \u03bbc(\u0394) is the critical point for the statistical physics phase transition for uniqueness/non-uniqueness on the infinite \u0394-regular tree. The running time of Weitz's algorithm is exponential in log\u0394. Here we present an FPRAS for the partition function whose running time is O*(n2). We analyze the simple single-site Markov chain known as the Glauber dynamics for sampling from the associated Gibbs distribution. We prove there exists a constant \u03940 such that for all graphs with maximum degree \u0394 \u2265 \u03940 and girth \u2265 7 (i.e., no cycles of length \u2264 6), the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics is O(n log n) when \u03bb", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Goethe University Frankfurt", "University of New Mexico", "University of Rochester", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Charilaos Efthymiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efthymiou:Charilaos", "Thomas P.
