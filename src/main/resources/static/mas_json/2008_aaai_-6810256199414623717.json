Existing OWL-based tools provide little or no support for the representation and management of metalevel information. To fill this gap, we propose a framework based on metaviews--ontologies that describe facts in the application domain. We have implemented our framework in the KAON2 reasoner, and have successfully applied it in a nontrivial scenario.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Thanh Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran_0001:Thanh", "Peter Haase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haase_0001:Peter", "Boris Motik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motik:Boris", "Bernardo Cuenca Grau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grau:Bernardo_Cuenca", "Ian Horrocks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horrocks:Ian"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
