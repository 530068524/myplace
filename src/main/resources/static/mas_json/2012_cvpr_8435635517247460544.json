{"title": "Improved subspace clustering via exploitation of spatial constraints.", "fields": ["kernel", "sparse approximation", "subspace topology", "sparse matrix", "lasso"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to improving subspace clustering by exploiting the spatial constraints. The new method encourages the sparse solution to be consistent with the spatial geometry of the tracked points, by embedding weights into the sparse formulation. By doing so, we are able to correct sparse representations in a principled manner without introducing much additional computational cost. We discuss alternative ways to treat the missing and corrupted data using the latest theory in robust lasso regression and suggest numerical algorithms so solve the proposed formulation. The experiments on the benchmark Johns Hopkins 155 dataset demonstrate that exploiting spatial constraints significantly improves motion segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Curtin University", "Deakin University", "Deakin University", "Deakin University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Duc-Son Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Duc=Son", "Budhaditya Saha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saha:Budhaditya", "Dinh Q.
