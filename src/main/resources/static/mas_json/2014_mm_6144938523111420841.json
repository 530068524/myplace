Our approach involves four distinct steps, and different creative outputs based on video inputs can be obtained by choosing different alternatives at each of the steps. First, we decide which features to extract from an input video sequence. Next, we choose a matching strategy to associate the features between a pair of video frames. Then, we choose a way to interpolate between corresponding features within these frames. Finally, we decide how to render these elements when resynthesizing the signal. We illustrate our approach with a range of different examples, including video manipulation experiments, animations, and real-time multimedia installations.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Arizona", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Javier Villegas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villegas:Javier", "Angus Graeme Forbes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forbes:Angus_Graeme"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
