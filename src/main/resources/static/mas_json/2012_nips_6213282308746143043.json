Large-sample properties of Conditional Markov Chains have been first studied in [1]. The paper extends this work in two directions: first, mixing properties of models with unbounded feature functions are being established; second, necessary conditions for model identifiability and the uniqueness of maximum likelihood estimates are being given.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["IBM", "McMaster University"], "authors": ["Mathieu Sinn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinn:Mathieu", "Bei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bei"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
