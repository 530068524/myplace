In particular, we study how to efficiently collect data from stationary sensor nodes using multiple robotic vehicles such as data ferries under different circumstance. The first group includes two new problems which aim to find the tours and the paths, respectively, of k robot vehicles with different mobilization conditions to collect data from ground sensor nodes with minimum latency. The second group consists of one new problem whose goal is to determine the quality tours of k robot vehicles with different speeds, where each of which follows its corresponding tour to repeatedly collect data from stationary sensors. We prove the three problems are NP-hard and propose constant factor approximation strategies for them. Through a simulation, an analytical study is conducted to evaluate the average performance of our core contribution.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Renmin University of China", "North Carolina Central University", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Renmin University of China", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "conf": "infocom", "authors": ["Lirong Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Lirong", "Donghyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Donghyun", "Yuqing Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yuqing", "Deying Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Deying", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0032:Wei", "Alade O.
