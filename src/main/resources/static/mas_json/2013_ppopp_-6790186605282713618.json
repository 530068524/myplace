We use hardware transactional memory (HTM) to construct a corrected version of the algorithm. This version is significantly simpler than the original and furthermore improves on it by eliminating usage constraints and reducing space requirements. Performance of the HTM-based algorithm is competitive with the original in \"normal\" conditions, but it does suffer somewhat under heavy contention. We successfully apply some optimizations to help close this gap, but we also find that they are incompatible with known techniques for improving progress properties. We discuss ways in which future HTM implementations may address these issues. Finally, although our focus is on how effectively HTM can correct and simplify the algorithm, we also suggest bug fixes and workarounds that do not depend on HTM.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Lehigh University", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Dave Dice.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dice:Dave", "Yossi Lev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lev:Yossi", "Yujie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yujie", "Victor Luchangco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luchangco:Victor", "Mark Moir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moir:Mark"], "pages": 10}
