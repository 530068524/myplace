{"title": "Global privacy guarantee in serial data publishing.", "fields": ["data mining", "serial communication", "information privacy", "satisfiability", "publishing"], "abstract": "While previous works on privacy-preserving serial data publishing consider the scenario where sensitive values may persist over multiple data releases, we find that no previous work has sufficient protection provided for sensitive values that can change over time, which should be the more common case. In this work, we propose to study the privacy guarantee for such transient sensitive values, which we call the global guarantee. We formally define the problem for achieving this guarantee. We show that the data satisfying the global guarantee also satisfies a privacy guarantee commonly adopted in the privacy literature called the local guarantee.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Simon Fraser University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Raymond Chi-Wing Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Raymond_Chi=Wing", "Ada Wai-Chee Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Ada_Wai=Chee", "Jia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jia", "Ke Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Ke", "Yabo Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yabo"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
