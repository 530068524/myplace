Our results imply that \"most\" Reed-Solomon codes are list decodable beyond the Johnson bound, settling the longstanding open question of whether  any  Reed Solomon codes meet this criterion. More precisely, we show that a Reed-Solomon code with random evaluation points is, with high probability, list decodable up to radius 1 ---  e  with list sizes  O (1/ e ) and rate \u03a9( e ). As a second corollary of our argument, we obtain improved bounds on the list decodability of random linear codes over large fields.   Our approach exploits techniques from high dimensional probability. Previous work used similar tools to obtain bounds on the list decodability of random linear codes, but the bounds did not scale with the size of the alphabet. In this paper, we use a chaining argument to deal with large alphabet sizes.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Atri Rudra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudra:Atri", "Mary Wootters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wootters:Mary"], "pages": 10}
