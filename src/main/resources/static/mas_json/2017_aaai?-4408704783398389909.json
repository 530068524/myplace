The Lasso and its extensions\nare standard methods for selecting a subset of features while\noptimizing a prediction function. In this paper, we are interested\nin embedded feature selection for multidimensional\ndata, wherein (1) there is no need to reshape the multidimensional\ndata into vectors and (2) structural information from\nmultiple dimensions are taken into account. Our main contribution\nis a new method called Regularized multilinear regression\nand selection (Remurs) for automatically selecting a subset\nof features while optimizing prediction for multidimensional\ndata. Both nuclear norm and the `1-norm are carefully\nincorporated to derive a multi-block optimization algorithm\nwith proved convergence. In particular, Remurs is motivated\nby fMRI analysis where the data are multidimensional and it\nis important to find the connections of raw brain voxels with\nfunctional activities. Experiments on synthetic and real data\nshow the advantages of Remurs compared to Lasso, Elastic\nNet, and their multilinear extensions.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University"], "authors": ["Xiaonan Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Xiaonan", "Haiping Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Haiping"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
