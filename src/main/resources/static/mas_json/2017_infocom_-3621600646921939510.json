A viable solution to such restriction is to incorporate and interconnect mobile devices towards a personal mobile cloud where these devices can complement each other via cooperative resource sharing, but is challenging due to the heterogeneity of mobile devices in both hardware and software aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel design of resource sharing framework to address these challenges and generically interconnect heterogeneous mobile devices. Our basic idea is to mask the hardware and software heterogeneity in mobile systems by exploiting the existing mobile OS services as the interface of resource sharing, and further develop the resource sharing framework as a middleware in the mobile OS. We have implemented our design over various mobile platforms with diverse characteristics and resource limits, and demonstrated that our design can efficiently support generic resource sharing among heterogeneous mobile devices without incurring significant system overhead or requiring individual system modification.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee"], "authors": ["Yong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yong", "Wei Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Wei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
