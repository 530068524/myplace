For this purpose, we tested two mobile phone applications that measure fine motor skills and vigilance in controlled temperature settings. Our results show that cold adversely affected participants' fine-motor skills performance, but not vigilance. Based on our results we highlight the importance of correcting measurements when investigating performance of cognitive tasks to take into account the physical element of the tasks. Finally, we identify a number of design recommendations from literature that can mitigate the adverse effect of cold ambiance on interaction with mobile devices.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"], "authors": ["Zhanna Sarsenbayeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarsenbayeva:Zhanna", "Jorge Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Jorge", "Juan Francisco Garc\u00eda Navarro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navarro:Juan_Francisco_Garc=iacute=a", "Simon Klakegg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klakegg:Simon", "Sirkka Rissanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rissanen:Sirkka", "Hannu Rintam\u00e4ki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rintam=auml=ki:Hannu", "Jari Hannu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hannu:Jari", "Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
