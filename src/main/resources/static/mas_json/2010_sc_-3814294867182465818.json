This paper introduces Hierarchical Diagonal Blocking (HDB), an approach which we believe captures many of the existing optimization techniques for SpMV in a common representation. Using this representation in conjuction with precision-reduction techniques, we develop and evaluate high-performance SpMV kernels. We also study the implications of using our SpMV kernels in a complete iterative solver. Our method of choice is a Combinatorial Multigrid solver that can fully utilize our fastest reduced-precision SpMV kernel without sacrificing the quality of the solution. We provide extensive empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of the approach on a variety of benchmark matrices, demonstrating substantial speedups on all matrices considered.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Guy E.
