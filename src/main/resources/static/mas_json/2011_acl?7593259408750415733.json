{"title": "A Discriminative Model for Joint Morphological Disambiguation and Dependency Parsing.", "fields": ["morphology", "syntax", "discriminative model", "dependency grammar", "parsing"], "abstract": "Most previous studies of morphological disambiguation and dependency parsing have been pursued independently. Morphological taggers operate on n-grams and do not take into account syntactic relations; parsers use the \"pipeline\" approach, assuming that morphological information has been separately obtained.\n\nHowever, in morphologically-rich languages, there is often considerable interaction between morphology and syntax, such that neither can be disambiguated without the other. In this paper, we propose a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["John Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:John", "Jason Naradowsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naradowsky:Jason", "David A.
