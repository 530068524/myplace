{"title": "Understanding and generating high quality patches for concurrency bugs.", "fields": ["empirical research", "real time computing", "bebugging", "software quality", "concurrency"], "abstract": "Concurrency bugs are time-consuming to fix correctly by developers and a severe threat to software reliability. Although many auto-fixing techniques have been proposed recently for concurrency bugs, there is still a big gap between the quality of automatically generated patches and manually designed ones. This paper first conducts an in-depth study of manual patches for 77 real-world concurrency bugs, which provides both assessments for existing techniques and actionable suggestions for future research. Guided by this study, a new tool HFix is designed. It can automatically generate patches, which have matching quality as manual patches, for many concurrency bugs.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["Haopeng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Haopeng", "Yuxi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yuxi", "Shan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Shan"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
