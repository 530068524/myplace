The proposed method effectively combines example-based and reconstruction-based temporal super resolution approaches. A periodic image sequence is expressed as a manifold parameterized by a phase and a standard manifold is learned from multiple high frame-rate sequences in the training stage. In the test stage, an initial phase for each frame of an input low frame-rate image sequence is estimated based on the standard manifold at first, and the manifold reconstruction and the phase estimation are then iterated to generate better high frame-rate images in the energy minimization framework that ensures the fitness to both the input images and the standard manifold. The proposed method is applied to low frame-rate gait recognition and experiments with real data of 100 subjects demonstrate a significant improvement by the proposed method, particularly for quite low frame-rate videos (e.g., 1 fps).", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Naoki Akae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akae:Naoki", "Al Mansur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mansur:Al", "Yasushi Makihara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makihara:Yasushi", "Yasushi Yagi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yagi:Yasushi"], "pages": 7}
