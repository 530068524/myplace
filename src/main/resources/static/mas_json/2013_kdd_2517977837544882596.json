HINs, composed of multiple types of entities and links are very common in the real world. Many have a text component, and thus can benefit from a high quality hierarchical organization of the topics in the network dataset. By organizing the topics into a hierarchy, AMETHYST helps understand search results in the context of an ontology, and explain entity relatedness at different granularities. The automatically constructed topical hierarchy reflects a domain-specific ontology, interacts with multiple types of linked entities, and can be tailored for both free text and OLAP queries.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Marina Danilevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danilevsky:Marina", "Chi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Chi", "Fangbo Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Fangbo", "Son Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Son", "Gong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Gong", "Nihit Desai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desai:Nihit", "Lidan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lidan", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
