However, this makes existing performance evaluation metrics obsolete. In this paper, I describe SAP HANA a novel, powerful database platform that leverages the availability of large main memory and massively parallel processors. Based on this, I propose a new, multi-dimensional performance metric that better reflects the value expected from today's complex information systems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["SAP AG, Palo Alto, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Vishal Sikka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sikka:Vishal"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
