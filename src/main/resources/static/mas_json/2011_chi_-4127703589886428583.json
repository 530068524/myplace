The goal of the project is to evaluate the design of a conference table that augments the everyday work patterns of small collaborative groups by incorporating an integrated annotation system. We present a holistic design that values hardware ergonomics, supports heterogeneous input modalities, generates a memory of all user interactions, and provides access to historical data on and off the table. We present a user evaluation that assesses the usefulness of the input modalities and software features, and validates the effectiveness of the MemTable system as a tool for assisting memory recall.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Waterloo", "Tactable Inc.,  ... sachusetts, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Seth E.
