{"title": "Reliability lessons learned from GPU experience with the Titan supercomputer at Oak Ridge leadership computing facility.", "fields": ["business process discovery", "open science", "titan", "supercomputer", "instruction set"], "abstract": "The high computational capability of graphics processing units (GPUs) is enabling and driving the scientific discovery process at large-scale. The world's second fastest supercomputer for open science, Titan, has more than 18,000 GPUs that computational scientists use to perform scientific simulations and data analysis. Understanding of GPU reliability characteristics, however, is still in its nascent stage since GPUs have only recently been deployed at large-scale. This paper presents a detailed study of GPU errors and their impact on system operations and applications, describing experiences with the 18,688 GPUs on the Titan supercomputer as well as lessons learned in the process of efficient operation of GPUs at scale. These experiences are helpful to HPC sites which already have large-scale GPU clusters or plan to deploy GPUs in the future.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Christian Brothers University", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Devesh Tiwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwari:Devesh", "Saurabh Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Saurabh", "George Gallarno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gallarno:George", "Jim Rogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogers:Jim", "Don Maxwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maxwell:Don"], "pages": 12}
