In this paper, we present a novel watermarking scheme for videos based on affine geometric transformations. Frames can be modified in an imperceptible manner by applying a small, global rotation, translation, or zooming, which can be detected later on by comparison with the originals. To compensate geometric distortions that have been introduced while a video travels down legal as well as illegal distribution chains, a spatio-temporal synchronization is performed using our video registration toolkit application. To evaluate our approach, we compare it with several other schemes regarding the robustness against common attacks, including camcorder capture.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Mannheim", "University of Mannheim", "University of Mannheim", "University of Mannheim"], "authors": ["Philipp Schaber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaber:Philipp", "Stephan Kopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopf:Stephan", "Fabian Bauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauer:Fabian", "Wolfgang Effelsberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Effelsberg:Wolfgang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
