Since wireless signals do not require line-of-sight and can traverse through walls, WiSee can enable whole-home gesture recognition using few wireless sources. Further, it achieves this goal without requiring instrumentation of the human body with sensing devices. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of WiSee using USRP-N210s and evaluate it in both an office environment and a two- bedroom apartment. Our results show that WiSee can identify and classify a set of nine gestures with an average accuracy of 94%.", "citation": "Citations (506)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Qifan Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Qifan", "Sidhant Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Sidhant", "Shyamnath Gollakota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollakota:Shyamnath", "Shwetak Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Shwetak"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
