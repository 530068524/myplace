{"title": "Crystal: precise and unobtrusive conflict warnings.", "fields": ["merge", "real time computing", "data mining", "computer science", "management science"], "abstract": "During collaborative development, individual developers can create conflicts in their copies of the code. Such conflicting edits are frequent in practice, and resolving them can be costly. We present Crystal, a tool that proactively examines developers' code and precisely identifies and reports on textual, compilation, and behavioral conflicts. When conflicts are present, Crystal enables developers to resolve them more quickly, and therefore at a lesser cost. When conflicts are absent, Crystal increases the developers' confidence that it is safe to merge their code. Crystal uses an unobtrusive interface to deliver pertinent information about conflicts. It informs developers about actions that would address the conflicts and about people with whom they should communicate.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Waterloo", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Yuriy Brun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brun:Yuriy", "Reid Holmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holmes:Reid", "Michael D.
