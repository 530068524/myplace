Senizergues (1997), who thus solved a famous long-standing open problem. A simplified proof, also providing a primitive recursive complexity upper bound, was given by C. Stirling (2002). In this paper, the decidability is re-proved in the framework of first-order terms and grammars (given by finite sets of root-rewriting rules). The proof is based on the abstract ideas used in the previous proofs, but the chosen framework seems to be more natural for the problem and allows a short presentation which should be transparent for a general computer science audience.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Ostrava"], "authors": ["Petr Jancar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jancar:Petr"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
