{"title": "\"When I am on Wi-Fi, I am fearless\": privacy concerns & practices in eeryday Wi-Fi use.", "fields": ["exploratory research", "personally identifiable information", "e commerce", "broadcast range", "social network"], "abstract": "Increasingly, users access online services such as email, e-commerce, and social networking sites via 802.11-based wireless networks. As they do so, they expose a range of personal information such as their names, email addresses, and ZIP codes to anyone within broadcast range of the network. This paper presents results from an exploratory study that examined how users from the general public understand Wi-Fi, what their concerns are related to Wi-Fi use, and which practices they follow to counter perceived threats. Our results reveal that while users understand the practical details of Wi-Fi use reasonably well, they lack understanding of important privacy risks. In addition, users employ incomplete protective practices which results in a false sense of security and lack of concern while on Wi-Fi. Based on our results, we outline opportunities for technology to help address these problems.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Predrag V.
