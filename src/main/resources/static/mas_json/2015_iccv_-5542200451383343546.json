Training such approaches typically requires additional viewpoint or keypoint annotation in the training data or, alternatively, synthetic CAD models. In this paper, we present an approach that creates a dataset of images annotated with bounding boxes and viewpoint labels in a fully automated manner from videos. We assume that the scene is static in order to reconstruct 3D surfaces via structure from motion. We automatically detect when the reconstruction fails and normalize for the viewpoint of the 3D models by aligning the reconstructed point clouds. Exemplarily for cars we show that we can expand a large dataset of annotated single images and obtain improved performance when training a viewpoint regressor on this joined dataset.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Nima Sedaghat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sedaghat:Nima", "Thomas Brox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brox:Thomas"], "pages": 9}
