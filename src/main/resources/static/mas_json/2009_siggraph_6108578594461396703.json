The animation captures more than four minutes of the complex dynamic rupture and wave propagation, including directivity effects, wave-guide phenomena, and local amplification of the ground shaking. The visualization presents these physical effects in an intuitive yet accessible manner, using a variety of visual representations and several views. The animation uses 11.8 terabytes of earthquake simulation output from a state-of-the-art earthquake simulation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of California, Los Angeles", "San Diego Supercomputer Center"], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Amit Chourasia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chourasia:Amit"], "pages": 1}
