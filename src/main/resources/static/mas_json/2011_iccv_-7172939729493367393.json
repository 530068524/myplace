We address this problem using deformable part-based models (DPM's) with latent SVM training [6]. These models have been introduced for fully supervised training of object detectors, but we demonstrate that they are also capable of more open-ended learning of latent structure for such tasks as scene recognition and weakly supervised object localization. For scene recognition, DPM's can capture recurring visual elements and salient objects; in combination with standard global image features, they obtain state-of-the-art results on the MIT 67-category indoor scene dataset. For weakly supervised object localization, optimization over latent DPM parameters can discover the spatial extent of objects in cluttered training images without ground-truth bounding boxes. The resulting method outperforms a recent state-of-the-art weakly supervised object localization approach on the PASCAL-07 dataset.", "citation": "Citations (329)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Megha Pandey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandey:Megha", "Svetlana Lazebnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazebnik:Svetlana"], "pages": 8}
