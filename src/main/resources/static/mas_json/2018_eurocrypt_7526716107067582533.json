Algorithms for this problem have several well-known applications in the design and analysis of Sboxes, cryptanalysis of white-box ciphers and breaking a generalized Even-Mansour scheme.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Itai Dinur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinur:Itai"], "pages": 30}
