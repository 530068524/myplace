{"title": "Smooth Primal-Dual Coordinate Descent Algorithms for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization.", "fields": ["random coordinate descent", "smoothing", "stochastic gradient descent", "coordinate descent", "homotopy"], "abstract": "We propose a new randomized coordinate descent method for a convex optimization template with broad applications. Our analysis relies on a novel combination of four ideas applied to the primal-dual gap function: smoothing, acceleration, homotopy, and coordinate descent with non-uniform sampling. As a result, our method features the first convergence rate guarantees among the coordinate descent methods, that are the best-known under a variety of common structure assumptions on the template. We provide numerical evidence to support the theoretical results with a comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Department of S ...
