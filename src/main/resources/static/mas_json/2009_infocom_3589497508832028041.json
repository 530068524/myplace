{"title": "SPARK: A New VANET-Based Smart Parking Scheme for Large Parking Lots.", "fields": ["information dissemination", "vehicular ad hoc network", "parking guidance and information", "cryptography", "parking lot"], "abstract": "Searching for a vacant parking space in a congested area or a large parking lot and preventing auto theft are major concerns to our daily lives. In this paper, we propose a new smart parking scheme for large parking lots through vehicular communication. The proposed scheme can provide the drivers with real-time parking navigation service, intelligent anti- theft protection, and friendly parking information dissemination. Performance analysis via extensive simulations demonstrates its efficiency and practicality.
