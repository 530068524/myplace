We have developed the Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling (CTSiM) learning environment to help middle school students learn science and CT concepts simultaneously. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages multiple linked representations to help students learn by constructing and analyzing computational models of science topics. Results from a recent study show that students successfully use the linked representations to become better modelers and learners.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Vanderbilt University", "Vanderbilt University", "Vanderbilt University"], "authors": ["Satabdi Basu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basu:Satabdi", "Gautam Biswas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biswas:Gautam", "John S.
