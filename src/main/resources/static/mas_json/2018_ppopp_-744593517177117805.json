{"title": "Featherlight on-the-fly false-sharing detection.", "fields": ["false sharing", "debugging", "cache", "profiling", "thread"], "abstract": "Shared-memory parallel programs routinely suffer from false sharing---a performance degradation caused by different threads accessing different variables that reside on the same CPU cacheline and at least one variable is modified. State-of-the-art tools detect false sharing via a heavyweight process of logging memory accesses and feeding the ensuing access traces to an offline cache simulator. We have developed F eather , a lightweight, on-the-fly false-sharing detection tool. F eather  achieves low overhead by exploiting two hardware features ubiquitous in commodity CPUs: the  performance monitoring units  (PMU) and  debug registers.  Additionally, F eather  is a first-of-its-kind tool to detect false sharing in multi-process applications that use shared memory. F eather  allowed us to scale false-sharing detection to myriad codes. F eather  detected several false-sharing cases in important multi-core and multi-process codes including previous PPoPP artifacts. Eliminating false sharing resulted in dramatic (up to 16x) speedups.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Baidu", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Milind Chabbi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chabbi:Milind", "Shasha Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Shasha", "Xu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Xu"], "pages": 16}
