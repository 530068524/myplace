{"title": "Statistical QoS Provisionings for Wireless Unicast/Multicast of Layered Video Streams.", "fields": ["unicast", "multicast", "streams", "fading", "channel"], "abstract": "Due to the time-varying wireless channels, deter- ministic quality of service (QoS) is usually difficult to guarantee for real-time multi-layer video transmissions in wireless networks. Consequently, statistical QoS guarantees have become an impor- tant alternative in supporting real-time video transmissions. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to model the statis- tical delay QoS guarantees, in terms of QoS exponent, effective bandwidth/capacity, and delay-bound violation probability, for multi-layer video transmissions over wireless fading channels. In particular, a separate queue is maintained for each video layer, and the same delay bound and corresponding violation proba- bility threshold are set up for all layers. Applying the effective bandwidth/capacity analyses on the incoming video stream, we obtain a set of QoS exponents for all video layers to effectively characterize this delay QoS requirement. We then develop a set of optimal adaptive transmission schemes to minimize the resource consumption while satisfying the diverse QoS requirements under various scenarios, including video unicast/multicast with and/or without loss tolerance. Simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the impact of statistical QoS provisionings on resource allocations of our proposed adaptive transmission schemes.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Qinghe Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Qinghe", "Xi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Xi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
