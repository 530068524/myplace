{"title": "Augmented Sketch: Faster and More Accurate Stream Processing.", "fields": ["stream processing", "sketch", "throughput", "data stream mining", "simd"], "abstract": "Approximated algorithms are often used to estimate the frequency of items on high volume, fast data streams. The most common ones are variations of Count-Min sketch, which use sub-linear space for the count, but can produce errors in the counts of the most frequent items and can misclassify low-frequency items. In this paper, we improve the accuracy of sketch-based algorithms by increasing the frequency estimation accuracy of the most frequent items and reducing the possible misclassification of low-frequency items, while also improving the overall throughput. Our solution, called Augmented Sketch (ASketch), is based on a pre-filtering stage that dynamically identifies and aggregates the most frequent items. Items overflowing the pre-filtering stage are processed using a conventional sketch algorithm, thereby making the solution general and applicable in a wide range of contexts. The pre-filtering stage can be efficiently implemented with SIMD instructions on multi-core machines and can be further parallelized through pipeline parallelism where the filtering stage runs in one core and the sketch algorithm runs in another core.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technische Hochschule", "Nanyang Technological University", "Technische Hochschule"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Pratanu Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Pratanu", "Arijit Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Arijit", "Gustavo Alonso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alonso:Gustavo"], "pages": 15}
