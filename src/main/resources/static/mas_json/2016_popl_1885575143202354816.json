{"title": "Type theory in type theory using quotient inductive types.", "fields": ["intuitionistic type theory", "homotopy type theory", "special case", "agda", "quotient"], "abstract": "We present an internal formalisation of a type heory with dependent types in Type Theory using a special case of higher inductive types from Homotopy Type Theory which we call quotient inductive types (QITs). Our formalisation of type theory avoids referring to preterms or a typability relation but defines directly well typed objects by an inductive definition. We use the elimination principle to define the set-theoretic and logical predicate interpretation. The work has been formalized using the Agda system extended with QITs using postulates.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Thorsten Altenkirch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altenkirch:Thorsten", "Ambrus Kaposi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaposi:Ambrus"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
