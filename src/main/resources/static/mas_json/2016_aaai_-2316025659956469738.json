{"title": "Gaussian Process Planning with Lipschitz Continuous Reward Functions: Towards Unifying Bayesian Optimization, Active Learning, and Beyond.", "fields": ["asymptotically optimal algorithm", "uncountable set", "bayesian optimization", "lipschitz continuity", "decision problem"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel nonmyopic adaptive Gaussian process planning (GPP) framework endowed with a general class of Lipschitz continuous reward functions that can unify some active learning/sensing and Bayesian optimization criteria and offer practitioners some flexibility to specify their desired choices for defining new tasks/problems. In particular, it utilizes a principled Bayesian sequential decision problem framework for jointly and naturally optimizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In general, the resulting induced GPP policy cannot be derived exactly due to an uncountable set of candidate observations. A key contribution of our work here thus lies in exploiting the Lipschitz continuity of the reward functions to solve for a nonmyopic adaptive e-optimal GPP (e-GPP) policy. To plan in real time, we further propose an asymptotically optimal, branch-and-bound anytime variant of e-GPP with performance guarantee. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our e-GPP policy and its anytime variant in Bayesian optimization and an energy harvesting task.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Chun Kai Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Chun_Kai", "Kian Hsiang Low.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Low:Kian_Hsiang", "Patrick Jaillet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaillet:Patrick"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
