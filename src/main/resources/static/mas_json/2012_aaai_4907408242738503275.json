Previous optimal solvers applied global A*-based searches. We present a new search algorithm called Conflict Based Search (CBS). CBS is a two-level algorithm. At the high level, a search is performed on a tree based on conflicts between agents. At the low level, a search is performed only for a single agent at a time. In many cases this reformulation enables CBS to examine fewer states than A* while still maintaining optimality. We analyze CBS and show its benefits and drawbacks. Experimental results on various problems shows a speedup of up to a full order of magnitude over previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (146)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Denver"], "authors": ["Guni Sharon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharon:Guni", "Roni Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Roni", "Ariel Felner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felner:Ariel", "Nathan R.
