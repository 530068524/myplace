Current practice for monitoring food intake relies on hand written food charts that have several inadequacies. We describe the design and validation of a tool for computer-assisted visual assessment of patient food and nutrient intake. To estimate food consumption, the application compares the pixels the user rubbed out against predefined graphical masks. Weight of food consumed is calculated as a percentage of pixels rubbed out against pixels in the mask. Results suggest that the application may be a useful tool for the conservative assessment of nutritional intake in hospitals.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Glasgow School of Art"], "authors": ["Rob Comber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Comber:Rob", "Jack Weeden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weeden:Jack", "Jennifer Hoare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoare:Jennifer", "Stephen Lindsay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindsay:Stephen", "Gemma Teal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teal:Gemma", "Alastair S.
