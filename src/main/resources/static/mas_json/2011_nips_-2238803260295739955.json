A very common form of nonlinear dependency between the components is correlations in their variances or energies. Here, we propose a principled probabilistic model to model the energy-correlations between the latent variables. Our two-stage model includes a linear mixing of latent signals into the observed ones like in ICA. The main new feature is a model of the energy-correlations based on the structural equation model (SEM), in particular, a Linear Non-Gaussian SEM. The SEM is closely related to divisive normalization which effectively reduces energy correlation. Our new two-stage model enables estimation of both the linear mixing and the interactions related to energy-correlations, without resorting to approximations of the likelihood function or other non-principled approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of our method with synthetic dataset, natural images and brain signals.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "University of Helsinki"], "authors": ["Junichiro Hirayama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirayama:Junichiro", "Aapo Hyv\u00e4rinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hyv=auml=rinen:Aapo"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
