In this paper we compare real-world pointing to pointing at virtual objects in a two-user scenario. In our study we investigated the following situation: One user points at an object while the second person has to guess the referenced object. Our results indicate that pointing at objects in a virtual world is much less precise than pointing in the real world even for a well calibrated stereoscopic two-user system. Pointing techniques like outlining an object or pointing from a distance produce more errors than the corresponding real-world techniques, but they are less error prone than interactions requiring to touch a virtual object. Our findings are a first step to qualify direct interaction techniques in a multi-user projection-based system.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Volkswagen", "Volkswagen", "Weimar Institute"], "authors": ["Holger Salzmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salzmann:Holger", "Mathias Moehring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moehring:Mathias", "Bernd Froehlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Froehlich_0001:Bernd"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
