The definition of an appropriate tailoring model is a critical task. Process users need tailoring that enables them to trim the process to reflect the actual needs. Process engineers need a method and a tool to define a valid model. The SE Book of T-Systems contains a feature model to describe variable parts of the process model and relations and constraints between these parts. The notation and semantics of feature models can be used to visually author a consistent and valid tailoring model. In this paper we present a tool for visual modeling and validation of process model tailoring based on feature models using the SE Book of T-Systems as an example. The tool is based on a domain-specific language that represents the process model. It leverages the semantics of feature models to provide an easy-to-use editor for tailoring-enabled process models.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Daniela Costache.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costache:Daniela", "Georg Kalus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalus:Georg", "Marco Kuhrmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhrmann:Marco"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
