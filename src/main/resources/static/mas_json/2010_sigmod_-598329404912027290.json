Many works have studied the problem of representing uncertainty on attribute values or tuples, like the fact that a value is 10 with probability .3 or 20 with probability .7, leading to the implementation of probabilistic database management systems. In our demo we deal with the representation of uncertainty about the  meta-data , i.e., about the meaning of these values. Using our system it is possible to create alternative probabilistic schemata on a database, execute queries over uncertain schemata and verify how this additional information is stored in an underlying relational database and how queries are executed.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "University of Bologna"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Matteo Magnani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magnani:Matteo", "Danilo Montesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montesi:Danilo"], "pages": 4}
