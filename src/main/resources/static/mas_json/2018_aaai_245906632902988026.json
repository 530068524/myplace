{"title": "BBQ-Networks: Efficient Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems.", "fields": ["artificial neural network", "monte carlo method", "reinforcement learning", "thompson sampling", "bootstrapping"], "abstract": "We present a new algorithm that significantly improves the efficiency of exploration for deep Q-learning agents in dialogue systems. Our agents explore via Thompson sampling, drawing Monte Carlo samples from a Bayes-by-Backprop neural network. Our algorithm learns much faster than common exploration strategies such as \\epsilon-greedy, Boltzmann, bootstrapping, and intrinsic-reward-based ones. Additionally, we show that spiking the replay buffer with experiences from just a few successful episodes can make Q-learning feasible when it might otherwise fail.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Zachary C.
