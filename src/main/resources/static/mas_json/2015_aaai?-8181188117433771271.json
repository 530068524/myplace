Despite their successes, a major problem faced by MOOCs is low completion rates. In this paper, we explore the accurate early identification of students who are at risk of not completing courses. We build predictive models weekly, over multiple offerings of a course. Furthermore, we envision student interventions that present meaningful probabilities of failure, enacted only for marginal students. To be effective, predicted probabilities must be both well-calibrated and smoothed across weeks. Based on logistic regression, we propose two transfer learning algorithms to trade-off smoothness and accuracy by adding a regularization term to minimize the difference of failure probabilities between consecutive weeks. Experimental results on two offerings of a Coursera MOOC establish the effectiveness of our algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Jiazhen He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Jiazhen", "James Bailey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailey:James", "Benjamin I.
