Using this formula, we are able to connect the cardinality of the dictionary with the eigen-decay of the covariance operator. In particular, we show that under certain technical conditions, the size of the dictionary will always grow sublinearly in the number of data points, and, as a consequence, the kernel linear regressor constructed from the resulting dictionary is consistent.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research"], "authors": ["Yi Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0003:Yi", "Faustino J.
