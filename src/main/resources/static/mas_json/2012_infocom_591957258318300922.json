The majority of results on link scheduling assume binary interference models for simplicity. While the physical interference model reflects the physical reality more precisely, the problem becomes notoriously harder under the physical interference model. There have been just a few existing results on centralized link scheduling under the physical interference model, though distributed schedulings are more practical. In this paper, by leveraging the partition and shifting strategies and the pick-and-compare scheme, we present the first distributed link scheduling algorithm that can achieve a constant fraction of the optimal capacity region subject to physical interference constraints in the linear power setting for multihop wireless networks.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yaqin Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yaqin", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Min Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Min", "Zhongcheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhongcheng", "Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie", "XuFei Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:XuFei", "Qiuyuan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Qiuyuan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
