In this context, we study the response time tail under generalized max-weight policies in settings where the traffic flows are highly asymmetric. Specifically, we study an extreme setting with two traffic flows, one heavy-tailed, and one light-tailed. In this setting, we prove that classical max-weight scheduling, which is known to be throughput optimal, results in the light-tailed flow having heavy-tailed response times. However, we show that via a careful design of inter-queue scheduling policy (from the class of generalized max-weight policies) and intra-queue scheduling policies, it is possible to maintain throughput optimality, and guarantee light-tailed delays for the light-tailed flow, without affecting the response time tail for the heavy-tailed flow.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "Indian Institute of Technology Madras", "California Institute of Technology", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Madras", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jayakrishnan Nair.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nair:Jayakrishnan", "Krishna P.
