Different from all previous work, we study the problem in the  noisy  data setting, where two different looking items in the stream may reference the same entity (determined by a distance function and a threshold value), and the goal is to estimate the number of distinct  entities  in the stream. In this paper, we formalize the problem of robust distinct elements, and develop space and time-efficient streaming algorithms for datasets in the Euclidean space, using a novel technique we call bucket sampling. We also extend our algorithmic framework to other metric spaces by establishing a connection between bucket sampling and the theory of locality sensitive hashing. Moreover, we formally prove that our algorithms are still effective under small distinct elements ambiguity. Our experiments demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Di Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Di", "Qin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qin"], "pages": 15}
