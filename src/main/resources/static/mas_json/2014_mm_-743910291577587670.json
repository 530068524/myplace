{"title": "Media Experience of Complementary Information and Tweets on a Second Screen.", "fields": ["immersion", "social media", "internet privacy", "multimedia", "second screen"], "abstract": "Television (TV) programs are increasingly augmented with second-screen applications that can provide complementary information and social media interaction related to the program. However, there is a lack of understanding about the optimal design of such applications. In this paper, we study the effects of complementary information and tweets on the media experience indexed by a comprehensive self-report questionnaire. We built a custom second-screen tablet application and conducted an experiment to investigate the effects of complementary information and tweets on the media experience of TV programs. Apart from reducing concentration and immersion, neither the presence of complementary information nor the presence of tweets affected the media experience of the TV programs, whereas the media experience of second-screen content depended on which program it accompanied. Our results demonstrate that the media experience of complementary information and tweets presented on second screens differs between TV programs.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University"], "authors": ["Kenta Kusumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kusumoto:Kenta", "Teemu Kinnunen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kinnunen:Teemu", "Jari K\u00e4tsyri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=auml=tsyri:Jari", "Heikki Lindroos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindroos:Heikki", "Pirkko Oittinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oittinen:Pirkko"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
