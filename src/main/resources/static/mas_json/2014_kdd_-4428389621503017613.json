The Nystrom method generates a fast approximation to any large-scale symmetric positive semidefinete (SPSD) matrix using only a few columns of the SPSD matrix. However, since the Nystrom approximation is low-rank, when the spectrum of the SPSD matrix decays slowly, the Nystrom approximation is of low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a variant of the Nystrom method called the modified Nystrom by spectral shifting (SS-Nystrom). The SS-Nystrom method works well no matter whether the spectrum of SPSD matrix decays fast or slow. We prove that our SS-Nystrom has a much stronger error bound than the standard and modified Nystrom methods, and that SS-Nystrom can be even more accurate than the truncated SVD of the same scale in some cases. We also devise an algorithm such that the SS-Nystrom approximation can be computed nearly as efficient as the modified Nystrom approximation. Finally, our SS-Nystrom method demonstrates significant improvements over the standard and modified Nystrom methods on several real-world datasets.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Shusen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shusen", "Chao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chao", "Hui Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Hui", "Zhihua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihua"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
