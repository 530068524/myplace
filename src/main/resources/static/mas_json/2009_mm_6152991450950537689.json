In this paper, we proposea novel feature selection (FSalgorithm to filter out the low efficiency features towards fast speech emotion recognition.Firstly, each acoustic feature's discriminative ability, time consumption and redundancy are calculated. Then, we map the original feature space into a nonlinear one to select nonlinear features,which can exploit the underlying relationship among the original features. Thirdly, high discriminative nonlinear feature with low time consumption is initially preserved. Finally, a further selection is followed to obtain low redundant features based on these preserved features. The final selected nonlinear features are used in features' extraction and features' classification in our approach, we call them qualified features. The experimental results demonstrate that recognition time consumption can be dramatically reduced in not only the extraction phase but also the classification phase. Moreover, a competitive of recognition accuracy has been observed in the speech emotion recognition.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Luming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Luming", "Mingli Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Mingli", "Na Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Na", "Jiajun Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Jiajun", "Chun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chun"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
