We prove that our proposed algorithm, dubbed geometric proximal gradient method (GeoPG), converges with a linear rate $(1-1/\\sqrt{\\kappa})$ and thus achieves the optimal rate among first-order methods, where $\\kappa$ is the condition number of the problem. Numerical results on linear regression and logistic regression with elastic net regularization show that GeoPG compares favorably with Nesterov's accelerated proximal gradient method, especially when the problem is ill-conditioned.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of California, Davis", "Tencent"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shixiang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shixiang", "Shiqian Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shiqian", "Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wei"], "pages": 9}
