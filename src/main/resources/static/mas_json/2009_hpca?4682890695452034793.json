{"title": "Optimizing communication and capacity in a 3D stacked reconfigurable cache hierarchy.", "fields": ["cache invalidation", "page cache", "pipeline burst cache", "smart cache", "cache pollution"], "abstract": "Cache hierarchies in future many-core processors are expected to grow in size and contribute a large fraction of overall processor power and performance. In this paper, we postulate a 3D chip design that stacks SRAM and DRAM upon processing cores and employs OS-based page coloring to minimize horizontal communication of cache data. We then propose a heterogeneous reconfigurable cache design that takes advantage of the high density of DRAM and the superior power/delay characteristics of SRAM to efficiently meet the working set demands of each individual core. Finally, we analyze the communication patterns for such a processor and show that a tree topology is an ideal fit that significantly reduces the power and latency requirements of the on-chip network. The above proposals are synergistic: each proposal is made more compelling because of its combination with the other innovations described in this paper. The proposed reconfigurable cache model improves performance by up to 19% along with 48% savings in network power.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "Intel", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Niti Madan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madan:Niti", "Li Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Li", "Naveen Muralimanohar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muralimanohar:Naveen", "Aniruddha N.
