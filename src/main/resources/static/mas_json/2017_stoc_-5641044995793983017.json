Let  MAJ   t , n   denote a  monotone unweighted threshold gate , i.e., the Boolean function which takes as input a single string  x  \u00e2   {0,1}  n   and outputs 1 if and only if  x  1  + \u00e2 \ufffd +  x   n   \u00e2 \ufffd  t . The function  Add   k , N   may be viewed as a monotone function that performs addition, and  MAJ   t , n   may be viewed as a monotone gate that performs counting. We refer to circuits that are composed of  MAJ  gates as  monotone majority circuits.    The main result of this paper is an exponential lower bound on the size of bounded-depth monotone majority circuits that compute  Add   k , N  . More precisely, we show that for any constant  d  \u00e2 \ufffd 2, any depth- d  monotone majority circuit that computes  Add   d , N   must have size 2 I\u00a9( N  1/ d  ) . As  Add   k , N   can be computed by a single monotone  weighted  threshold gate (that uses exponentially large weights), our lower bound implies that constant-depth monotone majority circuits require exponential size to simulate monotone weighted threshold gates. This answers a question posed by Goldmann and Karpinski (STOC\u00e2  93) and recently restated by Hastad (2010, 2014). We also show that our lower bound is essentially best possible, by constructing a depth- d , size 2  O ( N  1/ d  )  monotone majority circuit for  Add   d , N  .   As a corollary of our lower bound, we significantly strengthen a classical theorem in circuit complexity due to Ajtai and Gurevich (JACM\u00e2  87). They exhibited a monotone function that is in  AC  0  but requires super-polynomial size for any constant-depth monotone circuit composed of unbounded fan-in  AND  and  OR  gates. We describe a monotone function that is in depth-3  AC  0  but requires  exponential  size monotone circuits of any constant depth, even if the circuits are composed of  MAJ  gates.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Charles University in Prague", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Xi", "Igor Carboni Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:Igor_Carboni", "Rocco A.
