To this end, we introduce a methodology for discovering strong entity associations in all the slices (meta-data value restrictions) of a document collection. Since related documents mention approximately the same group of core entities (people, locations, etc.), the groups of coupled entities discovered can be used to expose themes in the document collection. We devise and evaluate algorithms capable of addressing two flavors of our core problem: algorithm THR-ENT for computing all sufficiently strong entity associations and algorithm TOP-ENT for computing the top-k strongest entity associations, for each slice of the document collection.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "AT&T Labs"], "authors": ["Nikos Sarkas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkas:Nikos", "Albert Angel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angel:Albert", "Nick Koudas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koudas:Nick", "Divesh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Divesh"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
