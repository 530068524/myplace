{"title": "Concerto: A High Concurrency Key-Value Store with Integrity.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "concerto", "associative array", "merkle tree", "concurrency"], "abstract": "Verifying the integrity of outsourced data is a classic, well-studied problem. However current techniques have fundamental performance and concurrency limitations for update-heavy workloads. In this paper, we investigate the potential advantages of  deferred  and batched verification rather than the per-operation verification used in prior work. We present  Concerto , a comprehensive key-value store designed around this idea. Using Concerto, we argue that deferred verification preserves the utility of online verification and improves concurrency resulting in orders-of-magnitude performance improvement. On standard benchmarks, the performance of Concerto is within a factor of two when compared to state-of-the-art key-value stores without integrity.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Arvind Arasu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arasu:Arvind", "Ken Eguro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eguro:Ken", "Raghav Kaushik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaushik:Raghav", "Donald Kossmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kossmann:Donald", "Pingfan Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Pingfan", "Vineet Pandey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandey:Vineet", "Ravi Ramamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramamurthy:Ravi"], "pages": 16}
