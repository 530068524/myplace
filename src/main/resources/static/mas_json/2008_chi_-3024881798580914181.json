{"title": "Cross-channel mobile social software: an empirical study.", "fields": ["social technology", "phone", "social software", "computer mediated communication", "communication in small groups"], "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a prototype system designed to support mobile group socializing that has been appropriated for everyday use by 150 users over 18 months. The system supports cross-channel communication, allowing users to participate in group conversations using text messaging, instant messaging, email and the web. It does this with the \"console,\" a uniform text-based syntax that enables the prototype to be used over a variety of mediums.   We found that participants used the system mostly for ad-hoc coordination rather than chat, with pervasive, cross-channel group communication supporting an informal \"half-invite\" style of invitation. We examine why coordination dominates over chat, suggesting that cross-channel mobile group messaging serves a distinct role, different to traditional text messaging, instant messaging and email. Furthermore, we found differences in the content and usage habits across channels, for example messages sent from a computer were more likely to refer to time and location than those sent using a phone. We also discuss the usage of the prototype and compare it to other work.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "Queensland University of Technology", "University of Queensland"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Clint Heyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heyer:Clint", "Margot Brereton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brereton:Margot", "Stephen Viller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viller:Stephen"], "pages": 10}
