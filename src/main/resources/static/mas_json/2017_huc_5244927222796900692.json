Lack of motivation is also another factor that can influence the output of any task or activity conducted by a user. This also applies to students within an academic context, where the distractions and lack of motivation can have a negative impact on their learning and results. In this paper, we propose 'Taskification', a task management mobile application, which incorporates core gamification features. The objective of this application is to increase student engagement and motivation during tasks such as coursework or exam preparation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of East London", "University of East London", "University of East London", "University of East London", "University of Engineering and Technology"], "authors": ["Usman Naeem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naeem:Usman", "Syed Islam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Islam:Syed", "Mhd Saeed Sharif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharif:Mhd_Saeed", "Sergey Sudakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sudakov:Sergey", "Muhammad Awais Azam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azam:Muhammad_Awais"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
