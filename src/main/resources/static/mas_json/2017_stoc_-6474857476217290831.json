{"title": "Uniform sampling through the Lovasz local lemma.", "fields": ["bounded function", "rejection sampling", "lovasz local lemma", "product distribution", "spanning tree"], "abstract": "We propose a new algorithmic framework, called \u201cpartial rejection sampling\u201d, to draw samples exactly from a product distribution, conditioned on none of a number of bad events occurring. Our framework builds (perhaps surprising) new connections between the variable framework of the Lovasz Local Lemma and some clas- sical sampling algorithms such as the \u201ccycle-popping\u201d algorithm for rooted spanning trees by Wilson. Among other applications, we discover new algorithms to sample satisfying assignments of k-CNF formulas with bounded variable occurrences.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Heng Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0001:Heng", "Mark Jerrum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jerrum:Mark", "Jingcheng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Jingcheng"], "pages": 14}
