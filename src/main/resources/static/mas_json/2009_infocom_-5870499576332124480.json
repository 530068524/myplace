In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for event frontline sensor detection based on statistical mixture methods with model selection (1), (11), (5). A Boundary sensor is considered as being associated with a multimodal local neighborhood of (univariate or multivariate) sensing readings, and each Non-Boundary sensor is treated as being with a unimodal sensor reading neighborhood. Further- more, the set of sensor readings within each sensor's spatial neighborhood is formulated using Gaussian Mixture Model (9), (5). Two classes of Boundary and Non-Boundary sensors can be effectively classified using the model selection techniques for finite mixture models. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm effectively detects the event boundary with a high accuracy under moderate noise levels.
