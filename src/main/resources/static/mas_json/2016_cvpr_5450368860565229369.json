{"title": "Large-Scale Semantic 3D Reconstruction: An Adaptive Multi-resolution Model for Multi-class Volumetric Labeling.", "fields": ["memory footprint", "prior probability", "computation", "3d reconstruction", "versa"], "abstract": "We propose an adaptive multi-resolution formulation of semantic 3D reconstruction. Given a set of images of a scene, semantic 3D reconstruction aims to densely reconstruct both the 3D shape of the scene and a segmentation into semantic object classes. Jointly reasoning about shape and class allows one to take into account class-specific shape priors (e.g., building walls should be smooth and vertical, and vice versa smooth, vertical surfaces are likely to be building walls), leading to improved reconstruction results. So far, semantic 3D reconstruction methods have been limited to small scenes and low resolution, because of their large memory footprint and computational cost. To scale them up to large scenes, we propose a hierarchical scheme which refines the reconstruction only in regions that are likely to contain a surface, exploiting the fact that both high spatial resolution and high numerical precision are only required in those regions. Our scheme amounts to solving a sequence of convex optimizations while progressively removing constraints, in such a way that the energy, in each iteration, is the tightest possible approximation of the underlying energy at full resolution. In our experiments the method saves up to 98% memory and 95% computation time, without any loss of accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Maros Blaha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blaha:Maros", "Christoph Vogel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogel:Christoph", "Audrey Richard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Richard:Audrey", "Jan Dirk Wegner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wegner:Jan_Dirk", "Thomas Pock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pock:Thomas", "Konrad Schindler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schindler:Konrad"], "pages": 9}
