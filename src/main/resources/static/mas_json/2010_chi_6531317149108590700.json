The motivations, norms and rules of online communities have been widely researched, however, social activity and its UX in modern Web services is a less studied area. We conducted a four-week-long field study with three Web services -- Facebook, Nokia Sports Tracker and Dopplr -- which all support social activity. The aim of this study was to identify the central drivers and hindrances of social UX, user experience of online social activity. Our results show that the main drivers of social UX include  self-expression, reciprocity, learning  and  curiosity , whereas  unsuitability of content and functionality, incompleteness of user networks  and  lack of trust and privacy  are often experienced as hindrances for social UX. Our findings also reveal the pragmatic and hedonic nature of the drivers and hindrances. The results can be used to inform design and evaluation of social UX in Web services.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Kaisa V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen-Vainio-Mattila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/V=auml==auml=n=auml=nen=Vainio=Mattila:Kaisa", "Minna W\u00e4ljas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/W=auml=ljas:Minna", "Jarno Ojala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ojala:Jarno", "Katarina Segerst\u00e5hl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segerst=aring=hl:Katarina"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
