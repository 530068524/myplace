We present an online clustering algorithm for L3M based on a feature-based item similarity function. We provide a learning framework for estimating the similarity function and present a fast stochastic gradient-based learning technique. In our experiments on coreference resolution and document clustering, L3M outperforms several existing online as well as batch supervised clustering techniques.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Google", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Rajhans Samdani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samdani:Rajhans", "Kai-Wei Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kai=Wei", "Dan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Dan"], "pages": 9}
