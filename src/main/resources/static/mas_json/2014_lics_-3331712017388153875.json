This result completes the computational complexity landscape for Presburger arithmetic, a line of research which dates back to the seminal work by Fischer & Rabin in 1974. Moreover, we apply some of the techniques developed in the proof of the lower bound in order to establish bounds on sets of naturals definable in the \u03a3 1 -fragment of Presburger arithmetic: given a \u03a3 1 -formula \u03a6( x ), it is shown that the set of non-negative solutions is an ultimately periodic set whose period is at most doubly-exponential and that this bound is tight.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Christoph Haase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haase:Christoph"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
