This is not only true for relational DBMSs but also for RDF stores. An RDF database consists of a set of triples and, hence, can be seen as a relational database with a single table with three attributes. This makes RDF rather special in that queries typically contain many self joins. We show that relational DBMSs are not well-prepared to perform cardinality estimation in this context. Further, there are hardly any special cardinality estimation methods for RDF databases. To overcome this lack of appropriate cardinality estimation methods, we introduce characteristic sets together with new cardinality estimation methods based upon them. We then show experimentally that the new methods are-in the RDF context-highly superior to the estimation methods employed by commercial DBMSs and by the open-source RDF store RDF-3X.", "citation": "Citations (150)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Mannheim"], "authors": ["Thomas Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann_0001:Thomas", "Guido Moerkotte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moerkotte:Guido"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 11}
