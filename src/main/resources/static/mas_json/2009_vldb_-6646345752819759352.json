However, it greatly increases the service matching time by executing semantic reasoning, and makes the real-time service selection and composition harder than before. To shorten service matching time, this paper presents an efficient Semantic Web Services matching mechanism with semantic information pretreatment. It shifts part of the reasoning process from service matching phase to service publishing phase. A prototype of Semantic Web Services matchmaker has been implemented based on this mechanism. The experiments on two service datasets show that our mechanism outperforms existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University"], "authors": ["Jing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jing", "Dianfu Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Dianfu", "Zhuo Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhuo", "Hong Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Hong", "Lusong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Lusong"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
