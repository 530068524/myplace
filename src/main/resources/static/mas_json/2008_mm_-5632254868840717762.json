We investigate the problem in three folds: (1) the effective concept mapping and selection methods over large-scale concept ontology; (2) the quality and feasibility of the pre-trained concept detectors applying on cross-domain consumer data (i.e., Flickr photos); (3) the search quality by fusing automatic concepts and user-annotated data (tags). Through experiments over large-scale benchmarks, TRECVID and Flickr550, we confirm the effectiveness of concept search in the proposed framework, where the semantic mapping by web-based kernel function over Google snippets significantly outperforms conventional WordNet-like methods both in accuracy and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "Chunghwa Telecom"], "authors": ["Po Tun Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Po_Tun", "Yi-Hsuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yi=Hsuan", "Kuan-Ting Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kuan=Ting", "Winston H.
