{"title": "Chat More: Deepening and Widening the Chatting Topic via A Deep Model.", "fields": ["dialog box", "perceptron", "recurrent neural network", "channel", "data mining"], "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed the boom of human-machine interactions, particularly via dialog systems. In this paper, we study the task of response generation in open-domain multi-turn dialog systems. Many research efforts have been dedicated to building intelligent dialog systems, yet few shed light on deepening or widening the chatting topics in a conversational session, which would attract users to talk more. To this end, this paper presents a novel deep scheme consisting of three channels, namely global, wide, and deep ones. The global channel encodes the complete historical information within the given context, the wide one employs an attention-based recurrent neural network model to predict the keywords that may not appear in the historical context, and the deep one trains a Multi-layer Perceptron model to select some keywords for an in-depth discussion. Thereafter, our scheme integrates the outputs of these three channels to generate desired responses. To justify our model, we conducted extensive experiments to compare our model with several state-of-the-art baselines on two datasets: one is constructed by ourselves and the other is a public benchmark dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our model yields promising performance by widening or deepening the topics of interest.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shandong University", "Tsinghua University", "Shandong University", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Shandong University"], "authors": ["Wenjie Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenjie", "Minlie Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Minlie", "Xin-Shun Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Xin=Shun", "Fumin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Fumin", "Liqiang Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Liqiang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
