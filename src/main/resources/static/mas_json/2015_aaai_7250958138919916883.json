{"title": "Content-Aware Point of Interest Recommendation on Location-Based Social Networks.", "fields": ["data mining", "internet privacy", "point of interest", "social network", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The rapid urban expansion has greatly extended the physical boundary of users' living area and developed a large number of POIs (points of interest). POI recommendation is a task that facilitates users' urban exploration and helps them filter uninteresting POIs for decision making. While existing work of POI recommendation on location-based social networks (LBSNs) discovers the spatial, temporal, and social patterns of user check-in behavior, the use of content information has not been systematically studied. The various types of content information available on LBSNs could be related to different aspects of a user's check-in action, providing a unique opportunity for POI recommendation. In this work, we study the content information on LB-SNs w.r.t. POI properties, user interests, and sentiment indications. We model the three types of information under a unified POI recommendation framework with the consideration of their relationship to check-in actions. The experimental results exhibit the significance of content information in explaining user behavior, and demonstrate its power to improve POI recommendation performance on LBSNs.", "citation": "Citations (180)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Huiji Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Huiji", "Jiliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jiliang", "Xia Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Xia", "Huan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Huan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
