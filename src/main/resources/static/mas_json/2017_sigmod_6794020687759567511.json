However, raw data from various sources must be wrangled into a suitable form before they are processed by the downstream data tools. People traditionally write data transformation programs to automate this process, and such work is cumbersome and tedious.   We built a system called FOOFAH for helping the user easily synthesize a desired data transformation program. Our system minimizes the user's effort by only asking for a small illustrative example comprised of the raw input data and the target transformed output; FOOFAH then synthesizes a program that can perform the desired data transformation. This demonstration showcases how the user can apply FOOFAH to real-world data transformation tasks.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Zhongjun Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Zhongjun", "Michael R.
