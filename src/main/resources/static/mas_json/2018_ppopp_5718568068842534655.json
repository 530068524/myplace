{"title": "Cache-tries: concurrent lock-free hash tries with constant-time operations.", "fields": ["concurrent data structure", "linearizability", "hash trie", "allocator", "non blocking algorithm"], "abstract": "Concurrent non-blocking hash tries have good cache locality, and horizontally scalable operations. However, operations on most existing concurrent hash tries run in  O (log  n ) time.   In this paper, we show that the concurrent hash trie operations can run in expected constant time. We present a novel lock-free concurrent hash trie design that exerts less pressure on the memory allocator. This hash trie is augmented with a quiescently consistent cache, which permits the basic operations to run in expected  O (1) time. We show a statistical analysis for the constant-time bound, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first such proof for hash tries. We also prove the safety, lock-freedom and linearizability properties. On typical workloads, our implementation demonstrates up to 5X performance improvements with respect to the previous hash trie variants.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Aleksandar Prokopec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prokopec:Aleksandar"], "pages": 15}
