{"title": "A Tool for Estimating Information Leakage.", "fields": ["confidence interval", "observable", "data mining", "real evidence", "information leakage"], "abstract": "We present leakiEst, a tool that estimates how much information leaks from systems. To use leakiEst, an analyst must run a system with a range of secret values and record the outputs that may be exposed to an attacker. Our tool then estimates the amount of information leaked from the secret values to the observable outputs of the system. Importantly, our tool calculates the confidence intervals for these estimates, and tests whether they represent real evidence of an information leak in the system. leakiEst is freely available and has been used to verify the security of a range of real-world systems, including e-passports and Tor.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Birmingham", "University of Birmingham", "University of Birmingham"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Tom Chothia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chothia:Tom", "Yusuke Kawamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawamoto_0001:Yusuke", "Chris Novakovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novakovic:Chris"], "pages": 6}
