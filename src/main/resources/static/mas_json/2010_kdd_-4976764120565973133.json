{"title": "MineFleet\u00ae: an overview of a widely adopted distributed vehicle performance data mining system.", "fields": ["analytics", "user interface", "architecture", "data stream mining", "telematics"], "abstract": "This paper describes the MineFleet distributed vehicle performance data mining system designed for commercial fleets. MineFleet analyzes high throughput data streams onboard the vehicle, generates the analytics, sends those to the remote server over the wide-area wireless networks and offers them to the fleet managers using stand-alone and web-based user-interface. The paper describes the overall architecture of the system, business needs, and shares experience from successful large-scale commercial deployments. MineFleet is probably one of the first commercially successful distributed data stream mining systems. This patented technology has been adopted, productized, and commercially offered by many large companies in the mobile resource management and GPS fleet tracking industry. This paper offers an overview of the system and offers a detailed analysis of what made it work.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Agnik, Columbia, MD, USA", "Agnik, Columbia, MD, USA", "Agnik, Columbia, MD, USA"], "authors": ["Hillol Kargupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kargupta:Hillol", "Kakali Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar:Kakali", "Michael Gilligan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilligan:Michael"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
