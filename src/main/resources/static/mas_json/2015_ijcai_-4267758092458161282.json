This assumption is unrealistic in settings where the voters are connected via an underlying social network structure, as social interactions lead to correlated votes. We establish a general framework -- based on random utility theory -- for ranked voting on a social network with arbitrarily many alternatives (in contrast to previous work, which is restricted to two alternatives). We identify a family of voting rules which, without knowledge of the social network structure, are guaranteed to recover the ground truth with high probability in large networks, with respect to a wide range of models of correlation among input votes.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Facebook"], "authors": ["Ariel D.
