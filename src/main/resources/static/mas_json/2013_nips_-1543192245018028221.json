Our method generalizes similar approaches to this problem such as spike triggered average, spike triggered covariance, or maximally informative dimensions. Instead of maximizing the mutual information between features and responses directly, we use integral probability metrics in kernel Hilbert spaces to minimize the information between uninformative features and the combination of informative features and responses. Since estimators of these metrics access the data via kernels, are easy to compute, and exhibit good theoretical convergence properties, our method can easily be generalized to populations of neurons or spike patterns. By using a particular expansion of the mutual information, we can show that the informative features must contain all information if we can make the uninformative features independent of the rest.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Lund University", "Department for  ... sity, T\u00fcbingen", "Department for  ... sity, T\u00fcbingen", "Department for  ... sity, T\u00fcbingen"], "authors": ["Fabian H.
