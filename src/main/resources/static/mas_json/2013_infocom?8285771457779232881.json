One research issue of practical importance is to search for a particular group of tags in a large-scale RFID system. Time efficiency is a core factor that must be taken into consideration when designing a tag search protocol to ensure scalability. In this paper, we design a new technique called filtering vector, which can significantly reduce transmission overhead during search process, thereby shortening search time. Based on this technique, we propose an iterative tag search protocol. In each round, we filter out some tags and eventually terminate the search process when the search result meets the accuracy requirement. The simulation results demonstrate that our protocol performs much better than the best existing ones.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Min Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0007:Min", "Wen Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Wen", "Zhen Mo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mo:Zhen", "Shigang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shigang", "Yuguang Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Yuguang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
