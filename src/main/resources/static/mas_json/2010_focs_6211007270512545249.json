That result showed that these codes can handle up to $\\frac{1}{3} $ fraction of errors. In this paper we show that the same codes can be locally unique-decoded from error rate $\\half-\\alpha$ for any $\\alpha>0$ and locally list-decoded from error rate $1-\\alpha$ for any $\\alpha>0$, with only a constant number of queries and a constant alphabet size. This gives the first sub-exponential codes that can be locally list-decoded with a constant number of queries.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Avraham Ben-Aroya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Aroya:Avraham", "Klim Efremenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efremenko:Klim", "Amnon Ta-Shma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Ta=Shma:Amnon"], "pages": 8}
