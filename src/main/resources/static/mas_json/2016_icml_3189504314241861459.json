Most previous work focuses on developing probabilistic models or parameterized strategies for specific applications. Inspired by the recent success of deep reinforcement learning, we present neural-based models that jointly learn a policy and the behavior of opponents. Instead of explicitly predicting the opponent's action, we encode observation of the opponents into a deep Q-Network (DQN); however, we retain explicit modeling (if desired) using multitasking. By using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, our model automatically discovers different strategy patterns of opponents without extra supervision. We evaluate our models on a simulated soccer game and a popular trivia game, showing superior performance over DQN and its variants.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["He He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:He", "Jordan L.
