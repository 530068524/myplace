{"title": "A* CCG Parsing with a Supertag and Dependency Factored Model.", "fields": ["syntax", "precomputation", "parsing", "natural language processing", "sentence"], "abstract": "We propose a new A* CCG parsing model in which the probability of a tree is decomposed into factors of CCG categories and its syntactic dependencies both defined on bi-directional LSTMs. Our factored model allows the precomputation of all probabilities and runs very efficiently, while modeling sentence structures explicitly via dependencies. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on English and Japanese CCG parsing.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Masashi Yoshikawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshikawa:Masashi", "Hiroshi Noji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noji:Hiroshi", "Yuji Matsumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsumoto_0001:Yuji"], "pages": 11}
