{"title": "Complementing Semantic Roles with Temporally Anchored Spatial Knowledge: Crowdsourced Annotations and Experiments.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "data mining", "semantic role labeling", "spatial analysis", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This paper presents a framework to infer spatial knowledge from semantic role representations. We infer whether entities are or are not located somewhere, and temporally anchor this spatial information. A large crowdsourcing effort on top of OntoNotes shows that these temporally-anchored spatial inferences are ubiquitous and intuitive to humans. Experimental results show that inferences can be performed automatically and semantic features yield performance improvements.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of North Texas", "University of North Texas"], "authors": ["Alakananda Vempala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vempala:Alakananda", "Eduardo Blanco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanco_0002:Eduardo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
