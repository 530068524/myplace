{"title": "Leveraging Human Routine Models to Detect and Generate Human Behaviors.", "fields": ["human behavior", "aggressive driving", "artificial intelligence", "psychological intervention", "machine learning"], "abstract": "An ability to detect behaviors that negatively impact people's wellbeing and show people how they can correct those behaviors could enable technology that improves people's lives. Existing supervised machine learning approaches to detect and generate such behaviors require lengthy and expensive data labeling by domain experts. In this work, we focus on the domain of routine behaviors, where we model routines as a series of frequent actions that people perform in specific situations. We present an approach that bypasses labeling each behavior instance that a person exhibits. Instead, we weakly label instances using people's demonstrated routine. We classify and generate new instances based on the probability that they belong to the routine model. We illustrate our approach on an example system that helps drivers become aware of and understand their aggressive driving behaviors. Our work enables technology that can trigger interventions and help people reflect on their behaviors when those behaviors are likely to negatively impact them.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Nikola Banovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banovic:Nikola", "Anqi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Anqi", "Yanfeng Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Yanfeng", "Christie Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Christie", "Julian Ramos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramos:Julian", "Anind K.
