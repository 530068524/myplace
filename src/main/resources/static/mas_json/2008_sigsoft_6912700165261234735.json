We address this challenge by employing a finite-state model of adaptive behavior to enable the detection of faults caused by (1) erroneous adaptation logic, and (2) asynchronous updating of context information, which leads to inconsistencies between the external physical context and its internal representation within an application. We identify a number of  adaptation fault patterns , each describing a class of faulty behaviors that we detect automatically by analyzing the system's adaptation model. We illustrate our approach on a simple but realistic application in which a cellphone's configuration profile is changed automatically based on the user's location, speed and surrounding environment.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln"], "authors": ["Michele Sama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sama:Michele", "David S.
