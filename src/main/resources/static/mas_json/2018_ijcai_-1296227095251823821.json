The translation from ABA to LP (with a few restrictions on the ABA framework) results in a normal logic program whose semantics coincide with the semantics of the underlying ABA\nframework. Although the precise technicalities are beyond the current extended abstract (these can be found  in  the  associated  full  paper)  we  provide  a number of examples to illustrate the general idea.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Cardiff University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Martin Caminada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caminada:Martin", "Claudia Schulz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schulz_0001:Claudia"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 5}
