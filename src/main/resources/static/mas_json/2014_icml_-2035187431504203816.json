The ability to accurately model distributions over functions is critical to the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization. Although Gaussian processes provide a flexible prior over functions, there are various classes of functions that remain difficult to model. One of the most frequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary functions. The optimization of the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms is a problem domain in which parameters are often manually transformed a priori, for example by optimizing in \"log-space,\" to mitigate the effects of spatially-varying length scale. We develop a methodology for automatically learning a wide family of bijective transformations or warpings of the input space using the Beta cumulative distribution function. We further extend the warping framework to multi-task Bayesian optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a jointly stationary space. On a set of challenging benchmark optimization tasks, we observe that the inclusion of warping greatly improves on the state-of-the-art, producing better results faster and more reliably.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Harvard University", "University of Toronto", "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "Harvard University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jasper Snoek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snoek:Jasper", "Kevin Swersky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swersky:Kevin", "Richard S.
