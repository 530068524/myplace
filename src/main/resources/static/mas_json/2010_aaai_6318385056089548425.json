{"title": "GTPA: A Generative Model For Online Mentor-Apprentice Networks.", "fields": ["complex network", "generative systems", "preferential attachment", "evolving networks", "generative model"], "abstract": "There is a large body of work on the evolution of graphs in various domains, which shows that many real graphs evolve in a similar manner. In this paper we study a novel type of network formed by mentor-apprentice relationships in a massively multiplayer online role playing game. We observe that some of the static and dynamic laws which have been observed in many other real world networks are not observed in this network. Consequently well known graph generators like Preferential Attachment, Forest Fire, Butterfly, RTM, etc., cannot be applied to such mentoring networks. We propose a novel generative model to generate networks with the characteristics of mentoring networks.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Michigan", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmad:Muhammad_Aurangzeb", "David A.
