{"title": "Robust routing in interdependent networks.", "fields": ["approximation algorithm", "algorithm design", "robustness", "disjoint sets", "interdependent networks"], "abstract": "We consider a model of two interdependent networks, where every node in one network depends on one or more supply nodes in the other network and a node fails if it loses all of its supply nodes. We develop algorithms to compute the failure probability of a path, and obtain the most reliable path between a pair of nodes in a network, under the condition that each supply node fails independently with a given probability. Our work generalizes the classical shared risk group model, by considering multiple risks associated with a node and letting a node fail if all the risks occur. Moreover, we study the diverse routing problem by considering two paths between a pair of nodes. We define two paths to be d-failure resilient if at least one path survives after removing d or fewer supply nodes, which generalizes the concept of disjoint paths in a single network, and risk-disjoint paths in a classical shared risk group model. We compute the probability that both paths fail, and develop algorithms to compute the most reliable pair of paths.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jianan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jianan", "Eytan Modiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Modiano:Eytan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
