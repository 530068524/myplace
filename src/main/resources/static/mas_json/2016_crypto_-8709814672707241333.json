{"title": "Cryptanalysis of the FLIP Family of Stream Ciphers.", "fields": ["homomorphic encryption", "stream cipher", "differential cryptanalysis", "stream cipher attack", "cipher"], "abstract": "At Eurocrypt 2016, Meaux et al. proposed FLIP, a new family of stream ciphers intended for use in Fully Homomorphic Encryption systems. Unlike its competitors which either have a low initial noise that grows at each successive encryption, or a high constant noise, the FLIP family of ciphers achieves a low constant noise thanks to a new construction called filter permutator.\n\nIn this paper, we present an attack on the early version of FLIP that exploits the structure of the filter function and the constant internal state of the cipher. Applying this attack to the two instantiations proposed by Meaux et al. allows for a key recovery in $$2^{54}$$ basic operations resp. $$2^{68}$$, compared to the claimed security of $$2^{80}$$ resp. $$2^{128}$$.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["S\u00e9bastien Duval.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duval:S=eacute=bastien", "Virginie Lallemand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lallemand:Virginie", "Yann Rotella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rotella:Yann"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2016", "pages": 19}
