{"title": "Enhancing Cross-Device Interaction Scripting with Interactive Illustrations.", "fields": ["multimedia", "scripting language", "storyboard", "visualization", "input output"], "abstract": "Cross-device interactions involve input and output on multiple computing devices. Implementing and reasoning about interactions that cover multiple devices with a diversity of form factors and capabilities can be complex. To assist developers in programming cross-device interactions, we created DemoScript, a technique that automatically analyzes a cross-device interaction program while it is being written. DemoScript visually illustrates the step-by-step execution of a selected portion or the entire program with a novel, automatically generated cross-device storyboard visualization. In addition to helping developers understand the behavior of the program, DemoScript also allows developers to revise their program by interactively manipulating the cross-device storyboard. We evaluated DemoScript with 8 professional programmers and found that DemoScript significantly improved development efficiency by helping developers interpret and manage cross-device interaction; it also encourages testing to think through the script in a development process.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Google", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Pei-Yu (Peggy) Chi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chi:Pei=Yu_=Peggy=", "Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang", "Bj\u00f6rn Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartmann:Bj=ouml=rn"], "pages": 12}
