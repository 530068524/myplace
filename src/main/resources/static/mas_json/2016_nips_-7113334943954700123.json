{"title": "Low-Rank Regression with Tensor Responses.", "fields": ["kernel", "least squares", "convex optimization", "multilinear map", "tensor"], "abstract": "This paper proposes an efficient algorithm (HOLRR) to handle regression tasks where the outputs have a tensor structure. We formulate the regression problem as the minimization of a least square criterion under a multilinear rank constraint, a difficult non convex problem. HOLRR computes efficiently an approximate solution of this problem, with solid theoretical guarantees. A kernel extension is also presented. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that HOLRR computes accurate solutions while being computationally very competitive.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Aix-Marseille University", "Aix-Marseille University"], "authors": ["Guillaume Rabusseau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabusseau:Guillaume", "Hachem Kadri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kadri:Hachem"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
