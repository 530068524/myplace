To this end, we propose a novel topic model that accounts for the two main factors that affect these occurrences: (1) the existence of global scene states that regulate which of the activities can spontaneously occur; (2) local rules that link past activity occurrences to current ones with temporal lags. These complementary factors are mixed in the probabilistic generative process, thanks to the use of a binary random variable that selects for each activity occurrence which one of the above two factors is applicable. All model parameters are efficiently inferred using a collapsed Gibbs sampling inference scheme. Experiments on various datasets from the literature show that the model is able to capture temporal processes at multiple scales: the scene-level first order Markovian process, and causal relationships amongst activities that can be used to predict which activity can happen after another one, and after what delay, thus providing a rich interpretation of the scene's dynamical content.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Idiap Research Institute", "Idiap Research Institute", "Idiap Research Institute"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jagannadan Varadarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varadarajan:Jagannadan", "R\u00e9mi Emonet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emonet:R=eacute=mi", "Jean-Marc Odobez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Odobez:Jean=Marc"], "pages": 8}
