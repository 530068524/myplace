Due to the KKT conditions, the M 3 N enjoys dual sparsity. However, the existing M 3 N formulation does not enjoy primal sparsity, which is a desirable property for selecting significant features and reducing the risk of over-fitting. In this paper, we present an  l  1 -norm regularized max-margin Markov network ( l  1 -M 3 N), which enjoys dual and primal sparsity simultaneously. To learn an  l  1 -M 3 N, we present three methods including projected sub-gradient, cutting-plane, and a novel EM-style algorithm, which is based on an equivalence between  l  1 -M 3 N and an adaptive M 3 N. We perform extensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real data sets. Our experimental results show that: (1)  l  1 -M 3 N can effectively select significant features; (2)  l  1 -M 3 N can perform as well as the pseudo-primal sparse Laplace M 3 N in prediction accuracy, while consistently outperforms other competing methods that enjoy either primal or dual sparsity; and (3) the EM-algorithm is more robust than the other two in pre-diction accuracy and time efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Eric P.
