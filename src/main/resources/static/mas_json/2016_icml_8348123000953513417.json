However, their methods require a slow and memory-consuming optimization process. We propose here an alternative approach that moves the computational burden to a learning stage. Given a single example of a texture, our approach trains compact feed-forward convolutional networks to generate multiple samples of the same texture of arbitrary size and to transfer artistic style from a given image to any other image. The resulting networks are remarkably light-weight and can generate textures of quality comparable to Gatys et al., but hundreds of times faster. More generally, our approach highlights the power and flexibility of generative feed-forward models trained with complex and expressive loss functions.", "citation": "Citations (207)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Yandex", "Yandex", "University of Oxford", "Computer Vision ... oltech, Russia"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Dmitry Ulyanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ulyanov:Dmitry", "Vadim Lebedev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lebedev:Vadim", "Andrea Vedaldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vedaldi:Andrea", "Victor S.
