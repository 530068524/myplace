Not only are the two problems inherently correlated and often appear concurrently, they are also exacerbated by incomplete data. We develop a novel algorithm to solve these two problems jointly under a unified framework, which helps reduce the impact of graph noise and benefits both tasks individually. We reduce multi-label learning problem into an additional link prediction task and solve both problems with marginalized denoising, which we co-regularize with Laplacian smoothing. This approach combines both learning tasks into a single convex objective function, which we optimize efficiently with iterative closed-form updates. The resulting approach performs significantly better than prior work on several important real-world applications with great consistency.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Criteo Lab, Palo Alto, CA"], "authors": ["Zheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zheng", "Minmin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Minmin", "Kilian Q.
