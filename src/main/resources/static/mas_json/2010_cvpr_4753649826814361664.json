Facial trait judgments have been studied in the psychological field, and have been determined to influence important social outcomes of our lives, such as elections outcomes and social relationships. Recent work on textual descriptions of faces has shown that trait judgments are highly correlated. Further, behavioral studies suggest that two orthogonal dimensions, valence and dominance, can describe the basis of the human judgments from faces. In this paper, we used a corpus of behavioral data of judgments on different trait dimensions to automatically learn a trait predictor from facial pixel images. We study whether trait evaluations performed by humans can be learned using machine learning classifiers, and used later in automatic evaluations of new facial images. The experiments performed using local point-based descriptors show promising results in the evaluation of the main traits.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Computer Vision ... mpus UAB, Spain", "Computer Vision ... mpus UAB, Spain", "Computer Vision ... mpus UAB, Spain"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mario Rojas Qui\u00f1ones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qui=ntilde=ones:Mario_Rojas", "David Masip.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masip:David", "Alexander Todorov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Todorov:Alexander", "Jordi Vitri\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitri=agrave=:Jordi"], "pages": 6}
