Apart from static wireless connections, people begin to expect more user-friendly features from this kind of networks, such as support for seamless roaming. In this paper, we study the handoff process in large AP-dense 802.11 networks, which is one of the most common forms of WiFi under usage. A series of field experiments are carried out and some critical handoff parameters are evaluated. With some newly discovered features, i.e. differentiated probe response time and rich AP information hidden in wireless traffic, we have managed to sig- nificantly improve the essential process of AP scan, a bottleneck towards fast and smooth handoffs. The solution is collectively called D-Scan (Scan in AP-Dense 802.11 networks). Real experi- ments are conducted to show the superiority of our solution.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "City University of Hong Kong", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Jin Teng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teng:Jin", "Changqing Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Changqing", "Weijia Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Weijia", "Dong Xuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xuan:Dong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
