Since there are many types of of source code changes we want to explore whether they appear frequently together in time and whether they describe specific development activities. We describe a semi-automated approach to discover patterns of such change types using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We extracted source code changes of one commercial and two open-source software systems and applied the clustering. We found that change type patterns do describe development activities and affect the control flow, the exception flow, or change the API.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "University of Zurich"], "authors": ["Beat Fluri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fluri:Beat", "Emanuel Giger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giger:Emanuel", "Harald C.
