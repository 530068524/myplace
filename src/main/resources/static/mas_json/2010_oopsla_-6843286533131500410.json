{"title": "Programming with time: cyber-physical programming with impromptu.", "fields": ["functional logic programming", "extensible programming", "programming domain", "reactive programming", "symbolic programming"], "abstract": "The act of computer programming is generally considered to be temporally removed from a computer program's execution. In this paper we discuss the idea of programming as an activity that takes place within the temporal bounds of a real-time computational process and its interactions with the physical world. We ground these ideas within the con- text of livecoding -- a live audiovisual performance practice. We then describe how the development of the programming environment \"Impromptu\" has addressed our ideas of programming with time and the notion of the programmer as an agent in a cyber-physical system.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Andrew Sorensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sorensen:Andrew", "Henry J.
