In this paper, we develop a simple but accurate enough analytical model for predicting queueing delay in non-homogeneous random access based WLANs. This leads to tractable solutions for meeting queueing delay specifications of a number of flows. Using this model, we address the feasibility problem of whether the mean delays required by a set of inelastic flows can be guaranteed in WLANs. Based on the model and feasibility analysis, we further develop an optimization technique to minimize the delays for inelastic flows. We present extensive simulation results to demonstrate the accuracy of our model and the performance of the algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Yan Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yan", "Chee Wei Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan_0001:Chee_Wei", "Ying Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ying", "Zheng Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Zheng", "P.
