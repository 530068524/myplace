{"title": "No-Match Attacks and Robust Partnering Definitions: Defining Trivial Attacks for Security Protocols is Not Trivial.", "fields": ["intuition", "key exchange", "cryptographic primitive", "cryptographic protocol", "computer security", "computer science", "versa", "mathematical proof"], "abstract": "An essential cornerstone of the definition of security for key exchange protocols is the notion of partnering. The de-facto standard definition of partnering is that of (partial) matching conversations (MC), which essentially states that two processes are partnered if every message sent by the first is actually received by the second and vice versa. We show that proving security under MC-based definitions is error-prone. To this end, we introduce  no-match attacks , a new class of attacks that renders many existing security proofs invalid. We show that no-match attacks are often hard to avoid in MC-based security definitions without a) modifications of the original protocol or b) resorting to the use of cryptographic primitives with special properties. Finally, we show several ways to thwart no-match attacks. Most notably and as one of our major contributions, we provide a conceptually new definition of partnering that circumvents the problems of a MC-based partnering notion while preserving all its advantages. Our new notion of partnering not only makes security definitions for key exchange model practice much more closely. In contrast to many other security notions of key exchange it also adheres to the high standards of good cryptographic definitions: it is general, supports cryptographic intuition, allows for efficient falsification, and provides a fundamental composition property that MC-based notions lack.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Huawei", "Ruhr University Bochum"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Yong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yong", "Sven Sch\u00e4ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=auml=ge:Sven"], "pages": 18}
