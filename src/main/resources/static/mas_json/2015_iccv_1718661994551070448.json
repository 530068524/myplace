{"title": "Person Re-Identification with Correspondence Structure Learning.", "fields": ["computer vision", "machine learning", "pattern recognition", "artificial intelligence", "boosting"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of handling spatial misalignments due to camera-view changes or human-pose variations in person re-identification. We first introduce a boosting-based approach to learn a correspondence structure which indicates the patch-wise matching probabilities between images from a target camera pair. The learned correspondence structure can not only capture the spatial correspondence pattern between cameras but also handle the viewpoint or human-pose variation in individual images. We further introduce a global-based matching process. It integrates a global matching constraint over the learned correspondence structure to exclude cross-view misalignments during the image patch matching process, hence achieving a more reliable matching score between images. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Zhengzhou University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yang Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yang", "Weiyao Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Weiyao", "Junchi Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Junchi", "Mingliang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Mingliang", "Jianxin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jianxin", "Jingdong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingdong"], "pages": 9}
