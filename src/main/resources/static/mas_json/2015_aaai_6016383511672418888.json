{"title": "Uniform Interpolation and Forgetting for ALC Ontologies with ABoxes.", "fields": ["automated reasoning", "reuse", "forgetting", "description logic", "abox", "ontology", "interpolation"], "abstract": "We present a method to compute uniform interpolants of ALC-ontologies with ABoxes. Uniform interpolants are restricted views of ontologies that only use a specified set of symbols, but share all entailments in that signature with the original ontology. This way, it allows to select or remove information from an ontology based on a signature, which has applications in privacy, ontology analysis and ontology reuse. We show that in general, uniform interpolants of ALC-ontologies with ABoxes may require disjunctive statements or nominals in the ABox. An evaluation of the method suggests however, that in most practical cases uniform interpolants can be represented as a classical ALC-ontology.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "Formal Methods"], "authors": ["Patrick Koopmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koopmann:Patrick", "Renate A.
