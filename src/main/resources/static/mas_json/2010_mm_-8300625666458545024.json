Since there are many factors influencing the correctness of the block mode selection, the decision of block mode is not an easy work. In this paper, a low complexity block mode selection model is proposed to select the block modes more correctly in the WZ (Wyner-Ziv) frame. The proposed block mode selection modules can increase the RD performance up to 2.8 dB as compared with the traditional DVC codecs; moreover, the subjective quality can also be improved by using the proposed deblocking filter when the objective quality is kept the same.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Bo-Ruei Chiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiou:Bo=Ruei", "Yun-Chung Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yun=Chung", "Han-Ping Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Han=Ping", "Ja-Ling Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ja=Ling"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
