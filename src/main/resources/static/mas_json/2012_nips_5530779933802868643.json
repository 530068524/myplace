To avoid any real resampling, we have linked this problem with finite group action and converted it into a problem of orbit enumeration. For further computational cost reduction, an efficient method is developed to list all orbits by their symmetry orders and calculate all index function orbit sums and data function orbit sums recursively. The computational complexity analysis shows reduction in the computational cost from n! or nn level to low-order polynomial level.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Institutes of Health", "George Mason University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Chunxiao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Chunxiao", "Jiseong Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jiseong", "Yun Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu_0001:Yun"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
