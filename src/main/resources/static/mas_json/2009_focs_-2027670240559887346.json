{"title": "On the Power of Randomization in Algorithmic Mechanism Design.", "fields": ["common value auction", "leverage", "algorithmic mechanism design", "approximation algorithm", "polynomial", "bounded function", "mechanism design"], "abstract": "In many settings the power of truthful mechanisms is severely bounded. In this paper we use randomization to overcome this problem. In particular, we construct an FPTAS for multi-unit auctions that is truthful in expectation, whereas there is evidence that no polynomial-time truthful deterministic mechanism provides an approximation ratio better than 2. We also show for the first time that truthful in expectation polynomial-time mechanisms are provably stronger than polynomial-time universally truthful mechanisms. Specifically, we show that there is a setting in which: (1) there is a non-polynomial time truthful mechanism that always outputs the optimal solution, and that (2) no universally truthful randomized mechanism can provide an approximation ratio better than 2 in polynomial time, but (3) an FPTAS that is truthful in expectation exists.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Shahar Dobzinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobzinski:Shahar", "Shaddin Dughmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dughmi:Shaddin"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
