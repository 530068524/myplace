{"title": "I Am The Passenger: How Visual Motion Cues Can Influence Sickness For In-Car VR.", "fields": ["immersion", "visual perception", "mixed reality", "entry point", "motion sickness"], "abstract": "This paper explores the use of VR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) in-car and in-motion for the first time. Immersive HMDs are becoming everyday consumer items and, as they offer new possibilities for entertainment and productivity, people will want to use them during travel in, for example, autonomous cars. However, their use is confounded by motion sickness caused in-part by the restricted visual perception of motion conflicting with physically perceived vehicle motion (accelerations/rotations detected by the vestibular system). Whilst VR HMDs restrict visual perception of motion, they could also render it virtually, potentially alleviating sensory conflict. To study this problem, we conducted the first on-road and in motion study to systematically investigate the effects of various visual presentations of the real-world motion of a car on the sickness and immersion of VR HMD wearing passengers. We established new baselines for VR in-car motion sickness, and found that there is no one best presentation with respect to balancing sickness and immersion. Instead, user preferences suggest different solutions are required for differently susceptible users to provide usable VR in-car. This work provides formative insights for VR designers and an entry point for further research into enabling use of VR HMDs, and the rich experiences they offer, when travelling.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mark McGill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGill:Mark", "Alexander Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Alexander", "Stephen A.
