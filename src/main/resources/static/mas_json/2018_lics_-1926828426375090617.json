{"title": "Species, Profunctors and Taylor Expansion Weighted by SMCC: A Unified Framework for Modelling Nondeterministic, Probabilistic and Quantum Programs.", "fields": ["morphism", "combinatorial species", "closed category", "nondeterministic algorithm", "quantum programming"], "abstract": "Motivated by a tight connection between Joyal's combinatorial species and quantitative models of linear logic, this paper introduces weighted generalised species (or weighted profunctors), where weights are morphisms of a given symmetric monoidal closed category (SMCC). For each SMCC W, we show that the category of W-weighted profunctors is a Lafont category, a categorical model of linear logic with exponential. As a model of programming languages, the construction of this paper gives a unified framework that induces adequate models of nondeterministic, probabilistic, algebraic and quantum programming languages by an appropriate choice of the weight SMCC.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Takeshi Tsukada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsukada:Takeshi", "Kazuyuki Asada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asada:Kazuyuki", "C.-H.
