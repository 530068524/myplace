We present here PSyHCoS, a tool for analyzing parametric real-time systems specified using the hierarchical modeling language PSTCSP. PSyHCoS supports several algorithms for parameter synthesis and model checking, as well as state space reduction techniques. Its architecture favors reusability in terms of syntax, semantics, and algorithms. It comes with a friendly user interface that can be used to edit, simulate and verify PSTCSP models. Experiments show its efficiency and applicability.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Paris", "Nanyang Technological University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["\u00c9tienne Andr\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andr=eacute=:=Eacute=tienne", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Yang", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Jin Song Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jin_Song", "Shang-Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shang=Wei"], "pages": 6}
