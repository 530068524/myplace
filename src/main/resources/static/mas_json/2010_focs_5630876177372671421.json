We give a new structure theorem for such identities. A direct application of our theorem improves the known deterministic d^{k^k}-time black-box identity test over rationals (Kayal & Saraf, FOCS 2009) to one that takes d^{k^2}-time. Our structure theorem essentially says that the number of independent variables in a real depth-3 identity is very small. This theorem affirmatively settles the strong rank conjecture posed by Dvir & Shpilka (STOC 2005). We devise a powerful algebraic framework and develop tools to study depth-3 identities. We use these tools to show that any depth-3 identity contains a much smaller nucleus identity that contains most of the \"complexity\" of the main identity. The special properties of this nucleus allow us to get almost optimal rank bounds for depth-3 identities.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["IBM", "Hausdorff Cente ... , Bonn, Germany"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Nitin Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena_0001:Nitin", "C.
