In the POSSIBLE-WINNER problem we are given a profile of voters, each with a partial preference order, and ask if there are linear extensions of the votes such that a designated candidate wins. We also analyze a special case of POSSIBLE-WINNER, the MANIPULATION problem. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for counting manipulations in a class of scoring protocols and in several other voting rules. We show #P-hardness of the counting variant of POSSIBLE-WINNER for plurality and veto and give a simple yet general and practically useful randomized algorithm for a variant of POSSIBLE-WINNER for all voting rules for which a winner can be computed in polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Jena", "AGH University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Yoram Bachrach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachrach:Yoram", "Nadja Betzler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Betzler:Nadja", "Piotr Faliszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faliszewski:Piotr"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
