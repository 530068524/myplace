As an important pre-processing step in data mining, feature selection needs to consider this vagueness or uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to evaluate the correlation between features and uncertain class labels on the basis of Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Consequently, the features can be ranked according to this criterion. Experimental results on extensive datasets demonstrate the benefits of our method.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Bo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Bo", "Yan Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia_0001:Yan", "Yi Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Yi", "Weihong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Weihong"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
