{"title": "Cryptographically verified implementations for TLS.", "fields": ["transport layer security", "executable", "key management", "hash based message authentication code", "cryptographic primitive"], "abstract": "We intend to narrow the gap between concrete implementations of cryptographic protocols and their verified models. We develop and verify a small functional implementation of the Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS 1.0). We make use of the same executable code for interoperability testing against mainstream implementations, for automated symbolic cryptographic verification, and for automated computational cryptographic verification. We rely on a combination of recent tools, and we also develop a new tool for extracting computational models from executable code. We obtain strong security guarantees for TLS as used in typical deployments.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Karthikeyan Bhargavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhargavan:Karthikeyan", "C\u00e9dric Fournet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fournet:C=eacute=dric", "Ricardo Corin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corin:Ricardo", "Eugen Zalinescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zalinescu:Eugen"], "pages": 10}
