[11] achieve state-of-the-art performance for a variety of object categories, but are still outperformed by simpler bag-of-words models for highly flexible objects such as cats and dogs. In these cases we propose to use the template-based model to detect a distinctive part for the class, followed by detecting the rest of the object via segmentation on image specific information learnt from that part. This approach is motivated by two ob- servations: (i) many object classes contain distinctive parts that can be detected very reliably by template-based detec- tors, whilst the entire object cannot; (ii) many classes (e.g. animals) have fairly homogeneous coloring and texture that can be used to segment the object once a sample is provided in an image. We show quantitatively that our method substantially outperforms whole-body template-based detectors for these highly deformable object categories, and indeed achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art on the PASCAL VOC competition, which includes other models such as bag-of-words.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "University of Oxford", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Omkar M.
