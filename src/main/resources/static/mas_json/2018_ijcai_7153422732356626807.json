However, designing CNN architectures still requires expert knowledge and a lot of trial and error. In this paper, we attempt to automatically construct CNN architectures for an image classification task based on Cartesian genetic programming (CGP). In our method, we adopt highly functional modules, such as convolutional blocks and tensor concatenation, as the node functions in CGP. The CNN structure and connectivity represented by the CGP encoding method are optimized to maximize the validation accuracy. To evaluate the proposed method, we constructed a CNN architecture for the image classification task with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can be used to automatically find the competitive CNN architecture compared with state-of-the-art models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Yokohama National University", "Yokohama National University", "Yokohama National University", "Tohoku University", "Yokohama National University", "Yokohama National University"], "authors": ["Masanori Suganuma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suganuma:Masanori", "Shinichi Shirakawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shirakawa:Shinichi", "Tomoharu Nagao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagao:Tomoharu"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 5}
