{"title": "Obfuscation of sensitive data in network flows.", "fields": ["encryption", "network security", "adversary", "microdata", "traffic analysis"], "abstract": "In the last decade, the release of network flows has gained significant popularity among researchers and networking communities. Indeed, network flows are a fundamental tool for modeling the network behavior, identifying security attacks, and validating research results. Unfortunately, due to the sensitive nature of network flows, security and privacy concerns discourage the publication of such datasets. On the one hand, existing techniques proposed to sanitize network flows do not provide any formal guarantees. On the other hand, microdata anonymization techniques are not directly applicable to network flows. In this paper, we propose a novel obfuscation technique for network flows that provides formal guarantees under realistic assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. Our work is supported by extensive experiments with a large set of real network flows collected at an important Italian Tier II Autonomous System, hosting sensitive government and corporate sites. Experimental results show that our obfuscation technique preserves the utility of network flows for network traffic analysis.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Milan", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "University of Milan", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "authors": ["Daniele Riboni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riboni:Daniele", "Antonio Villani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villani:Antonio", "Domenico Vitali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitali:Domenico", "Claudio Bettini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bettini:Claudio", "Luigi V.
