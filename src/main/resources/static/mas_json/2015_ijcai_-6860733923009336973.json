{"title": "Trust-Sensitive Belief Revision.", "fields": ["operator", "belief revision", "metric", "incentive", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "Belief revision is concerned with incorporating new information into a pre-existing set of beliefs. When the new information comes from another agent, we must first determine if that agent should be trusted. In this paper, we define trust as a pre-processing step before revision. We emphasize that trust in an agent is often restricted to a particular domain of expertise. We demonstrate that this form of trust can be captured by associating a state partition with each agent, then relativizing all reports to this partition before revising. We position the resulting family of trust-sensitive revision operators within the class of selective revision operators of Ferme and Hansson, and we examine its properties. In particular, we show how trust-sensitive revision is manipulable, in the sense that agents can sometimes have incentive to pass on misleading information. When multiple reporting agents are involved, we use a distance function over states to represent differing degrees of trust; this ensures that the most trusted reports will be believed.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["British Columbia Institute of Technology", "Mahasarakham University"], "authors": ["Aaron Hunter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hunter:Aaron", "Richard Booth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Booth_0001:Richard"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
