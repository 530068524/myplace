We develop an algorithm that is a fusion of lil-UCB and KL-LUCB, offering the best qualities of the two algorithms in one method. This is achieved by proving a novel anytime confidence bound for the mean of bounded distributions, which is the analogue of the LIL-type bounds recently developed for sub-Gaussian distributions. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical experiments based on the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of W ... consion-Madison", "Former Cartoon  ...
