The algorithm extends previous work of Freund and Schapire (Games and Economic Behavior \u201999) with the advantage that the algorithm runs in poly(n) time even when a pure strategy for the first player is a distribution chosen from a set of distributions over {0, 1} n . This extension enables a number of additional applications in cryptography and complexity theory, often yielding uniform security versions of results that were previously only proved for nonuniform security (due to use of the non-constructive Min-Max Theorem).", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Salil P.
