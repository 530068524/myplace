It is shown that both algorithms can be viewed as an application of the perceptron cycling theorem. This connection strengthens some herding results and suggests new (supervised) herding algorithms that, like CRFs or discriminative RBMs, make predictions by conditioning on the input attributes. We develop and investigate variants of conditional herding, and show that conditional herding leads to practical algorithms that perform better than or on par with related classifiers such as the voted perceptron and the discriminative RBM.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "Delft University of Technology", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Andrew Gelfand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelfand:Andrew", "Yutian Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yutian", "Laurens van der Maaten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maaten:Laurens_van_der", "Max Welling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welling:Max"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
