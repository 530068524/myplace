{"title": "Tickers and Talker: An Accessible Labeling Toolkit for 3D Printed Models.", "fields": ["3d modeling", "software", "signal processing", "multimedia", "graphics"], "abstract": "Three-dimensional models are important learning resources for blind people. With advances in 3D printing, 3D models are becoming more available. However, unlike visual or tactile graphics, there is no standard accessible way to label components in 3D models. We present a labeling toolkit that enables users to add and access audio labels to 3D printed models. The toolkit includes Tickers, small 3D printed percussion instruments added to 3D models, and Talker, a signal processing application that detects and classifies Ticker sounds. To use the toolkit, a model designer adds Tickers to a model using 3D modeling software. A user then prints the model with Tickers and records audio labels for each Ticker. Finally, users can strum the Tickers and Talker will play the corresponding labels. We evaluated Tickers and Talker with three models in a study with nine blind participants. Our toolkit achieved an accuracy of 93% across all participants and models. We discuss design implications and future work for accessible 3D printed models.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Shenkar College of Engineering and Design", "University of Washington", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Lei Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Lei", "Idan Zelzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zelzer:Idan", "Catherine Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Catherine", "Shiri Azenkot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azenkot:Shiri"], "pages": 12}
