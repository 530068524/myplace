{"title": "Infographic Aesthetics: Designing for the First Impression.", "fields": ["infographic", "mere exposure effect", "first impression", "data visualization", "colorfulness"], "abstract": "Information graphics, or infographics, combine elements of data visualization with design and have become an increasingly popular means for disseminating data. While several studies have suggested that aesthetics in visualization and infographics relate to desirable outcomes like engagement and memorability, it remains unknown how quickly aesthetic impressions are formed, and what it is that makes an infographic appealing. We address these questions by analyzing 1,278 participants' ratings on appeal after seeing infographics for 500ms. Our results establish that: 1) people form a reliable first impression of the appeal of an infographic based on a mere exposure effect, 2) this first impression is largely based on colorfulness and visual complexity, and 3) age, gender, and education level influence the preferred level of colorfulness and complexity. More generally, these findings suggest that outcomes such as engagement and memorability might be determined much earlier than previously thought.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tufts University", "University of Michigan", "Tufts University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Lane Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Lane", "Katharina Reinecke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reinecke:Katharina", "Remco Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Remco"], "pages": 4}
