Unfortunately, today's routing algorithms do not utilize this important resource most efficiently. We first demonstrate this by defining the  dark fiber  metric as a measure of unused resource in networks. To improve the utilization, we propose scheduling-aware routing, a new technique that uses the current state of the batch system to determine a new set of network routes and so increases overall system utilization by up to 17.74%. We also show that our proposed routing increases the throughput of communication benchmarks by up to 17.6% on a practical InfiniBand installation. Our routing method is implemented in the standard InfiniBand tool set and can immediately be used to optimize systems. In fact, we are using it to improve the utilization of our production petascale supercomputer for more than one year.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Jens Domke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Domke:Jens", "Torsten Hoefler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoefler:Torsten"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
