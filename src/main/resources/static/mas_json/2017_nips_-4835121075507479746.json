However, its main drawback is that it neglects possible interactions between predictor variables. In this paper, we reexamine the group additive model proposed in the literature, and rigorously define the intrinsic group additive structure for the relationship between the response variable $Y$ and the predictor vector $\\vect{X}$, and further develop an effective structure-penalized kernel method for simultaneous identification of the intrinsic group additive structure and nonparametric function estimation. The method utilizes a novel complexity measure we derive for group additive structures. We show that the proposed method is consistent in identifying the intrinsic group additive structure. Simulation study and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method as a general tool for high dimensional nonparametric regression.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Chao Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Chao", "Michael Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Michael"], "pages": 10}
