Inspired by hand-weaving craft, WeaveMesh supports a highly customizable software platform, which is applicable for simulating and facilitating freeform surface constructions composed of woven lines arranged in a regular grid, which can serve as a guide for easy assembly. In addition, mobilizable connectors are suggested to support flexible assembly, which can be revised, recycled, and reused to facilitate short iterations. Furthermore, compared to common additive and subtractive techniques, WeaveMesh has a better balance between time and material saving. In this paper, we will introduce the system in detail and demonstrate the feasibility of the technique through various 3D models in the area of interactive media, products and architecture.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ye Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Ye", "Guanyun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guanyun", "Caowei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Caowei", "Nannan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Nannan", "Xiaolian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiaolian", "Cheng Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Cheng", "Fangtian Ying.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ying:Fangtian"], "pages": 10}
