{"title": "A Security Architecture Achieving Anonymity and Traceability in Wireless Mesh Networks.", "fields": ["wireless mesh network", "anonymity", "information security", "enterprise information security architecture", "data security"], "abstract": "Anonymity has received increasing attention in the literature due to the users' awareness of their privacy nowadays. Anonymity provides protection for users to enjoy network services without being traced. While anonymity related issues have been extensively studied in payment-based systems such as e-cash [1] and peer-to-peer (P2P) [2] systems, little effort has been devoted to wireless mesh networks (WMNs). On the other hand, the network authority requires conditional anonymity such that misbehaving entities in the network remain traceable. In this paper, we propose a security architecture to ensure unconditional anonymity for honest users and traceability of misbehaving users for network authorities in WMNs. The proposed architecture strives to resolve the conflicts between the anonymity and traceability objectives, in addition to guaranteeing fundamental security requirements including authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and non-repudiation [3]. Further security enhancements can be incorporated, rendering the proposed architecture conditionally anonymous in terms of network access activities, location information, and communication paths.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Jinyuan Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jinyuan", "Chi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Chi", "Yuguang Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Yuguang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
