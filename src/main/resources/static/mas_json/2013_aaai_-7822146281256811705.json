However, significant technical challenges must be overcome to understand this information and harness its potential for science and conservation. We present an approximate Bayesian inference algorithm to reconstruct the velocity fields of birds migrating in the vicinity of a radar station. This is part of a larger project to quantify bird migration at large scales using weather radar data.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Cornell University", "Oregon State University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Daniel R.
