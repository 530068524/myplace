{"title": "Deceptive Path-Planning.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "motion planning", "deception", "observer", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Deceptive path-planning involves finding a path such that the probability of an observer identifying the path's final destination - before it has been reached - is minimised. This paper formalises deception as it applies to path-planning and introduces the notion of a last deceptive point (LDP) which, when measured in terms of 'path completion', can be used to rank paths by their potential to deceive. Building on recent developments in probabilistic goal-recognition, we propose a formula to calculate an optimal LDP and present strategies for the generation of deceptive paths by both simulation ('showing the false') and dissimulation ('hiding the real').", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["RMIT University", "RMIT University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Peta Masters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masters:Peta", "Sebastian Sardi\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sardi=ntilde=a:Sebastian"], "pages": 8}
