However, their evaluation has focused on favorable conditions, using comparable corpora or closely-related languages, and we show that they often fail in more realistic scenarios. This work proposes an alternative approach based on a fully unsupervised initialization that explicitly exploits the structural similarity of the embeddings, and a robust self-learning algorithm that iteratively improves this solution. Our method succeeds in all tested scenarios and obtains the best published results in standard datasets, even surpassing previous supervised systems. Our implementation is released as an open source project at this https URL", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of the Basque Country"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Eneko Agirre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agirre:Eneko", "Gorka Labaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Labaka:Gorka", "Mikel Artetxe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Artetxe:Mikel"], "pages": 10}
