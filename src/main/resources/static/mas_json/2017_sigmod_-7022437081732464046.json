{"title": "Graph Data Mining with Arabesque.", "fields": ["factor critical graph", "distance hereditary graph", "complement graph", "null graph", "clique width"], "abstract": "Graph data mining is defined as searching in an input graph for all subgraphs that satisfy some property that makes them interesting to the user. Examples of graph data mining problems include frequent subgraph mining, counting motifs, and enumerating cliques. These problems differ from other graph processing problems such as PageRank or shortest path in that graph data mining requires searching through an exponential number of subgraphs. Most current parallel graph analytics systems do not provide good support for graph data mining. One notable exception is Arabesque, a system that was built specifically to support graph data mining. Arabesque provides a simple programming model to express graph data mining computations, and a highly scalable and efficient implementation of this model, scaling to billions of subgraphs on hundreds of cores. This demonstration will showcase the Arabesque system, focusing on the end-user experience and showing how Arabesque can be used to simply and efficiently solve practical graph data mining problems that would be difficult with other systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Qatar Airways"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Eslam Hussein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hussein:Eslam", "Abdurrahman Ghanem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghanem:Abdurrahman", "Vin\u00edcius Vitor dos Santos Dias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dias:Vin=iacute=cius_Vitor_dos_Santos", "Carlos H.
