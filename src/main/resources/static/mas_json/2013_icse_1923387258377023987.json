{"title": "Cassandra: proactive conflict minimization through optimized task scheduling.", "fields": ["minification", "scheduling", "angle of incidence", "task analysis", "workspace"], "abstract": "Software conflicts arising because of conflicting changes are a regular occurrence and delay projects. The main precept of workspace awareness tools has been to identify potential conflicts early, while changes are still small and easier to resolve. However, in this approach conflicts still occur and require developer time and effort to resolve. We present a novel conflict minimization technique that proactively identifies potential conflicts, encodes them as constraints, and solves the constraint space to recommend a set of conflict-minimal development paths for the team. Here we present a study of four open source projects to characterize the distribution of conflicts and their resolution efforts. We then explain our conflict minimization technique and the design and implementation of this technique in our prototype, Cassandra. We show that Cassandra would have successfully avoided a majority of conflicts in the four open source test subjects. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by applying the technique to a simulated set of scenarios with higher than normal incidence of conflicts.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln"], "authors": ["Bakhtiar Khan Kasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasi:Bakhtiar_Khan", "Anita Sarma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarma:Anita"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
