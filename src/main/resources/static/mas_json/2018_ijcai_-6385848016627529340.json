Reinforcement learning relies on learning from interactions with real world, which often requires an unfeasibly large amount of experience. Symbolic planning relies on manually crafted symbolic knowledge, which may not be robust to domain uncertainties and changes. In this paper we present a unified framework {\\em PEORL} that integrates symbolic planning with hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to cope with decision-making in a dynamic environment with uncertainties. \nSymbolic plans are used to guide the agent's task execution and learning, and the learned experience is fed back to symbolic knowledge to improve planning. This method leads to rapid policy search and robust symbolic plans in complex domains. The framework is tested on benchmark domains of HRL.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Auburn University", "Auburn University", "Maana Inc.", "Maana Inc."], "authors": ["Fangkai Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Fangkai", "Daoming Lyu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyu:Daoming", "Bo Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Bo", "Steven Gustafson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gustafson:Steven"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
