However, the sink-based diagnosis tools incur huge communication overhead to the traffic sensitive sensor networks. Also, due to the unreliable wireless communications, sink often obtains incomplete and sometimes suspicious information, leading to highly inaccurate judgments. Even worse, we observe that it is always more difficult to obtain state information from the problematic or critical regions. To address the above issues, we present the concept of self-diagnosis, which encourages each single sensor to join the fault decision process. We design a series of novel fault detectors through which multiple nodes can cooperate with each other in a diagnosis task. The fault detectors encode the diagnosis process to state transitions. Each sensor can participate in the fault diagnosis by transiting the detector's current state to a new one based on local evidences and then pass the fault detector to other nodes. Having sufficient evidences, the fault detector achieves the Accept state and outputs the final diagnosis report. We examine the performance of our self-diagnosis tool called TinyD2 on a 100 nodes testbed.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Kebin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Kebin", "Qiang Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Qiang", "Xibin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xibin", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
