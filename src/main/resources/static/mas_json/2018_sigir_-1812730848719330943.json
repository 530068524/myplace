{"title": "Taxi or Hitchhiking: Predicting Passenger's Preferred Service on Ride Sharing Platforms.", "fields": ["recommender system", "scheduling", "computer science", "data mining"], "abstract": "Ride sharing apps like Uber and Didi Chuxing have played an important role in addressing the users' transportation needs, which come not only in huge volumes, but also in great variety. While some users prefer low-cost services such as carpooling or hitchhiking, others prefer more pricey options like taxi or premier services. Further analyses suggest that such preference may also be associated with different time and location. In this paper, we empirically analyze the preferred services and propose a recommender system which provides service recommendation based on temporal, spatial, and behavioral features. Offline simulations show that our system achieves a high prediction accuracy and reduces the user's effort in finding the desired service. Such a recommender system allows a more precise scheduling for the platform, and enables personalized promotions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Beijing Jiaotong University", "Didi Chuxing, Beijing, China", "Didi Chuxing, Beijing, China"], "authors": ["Lingyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lingyu", "Wei Ai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ai:Wei", "Chuan Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Chuan", "Yuhui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yuhui", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
