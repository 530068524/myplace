Our system has been inspired by previous research on calendaring and popular social network applications, in particular microblogging. Timely provides an open, social space for enterprise users to share their events, socialize, and discover what else is going on in their network and beyond. A detailed analysis of the events shared by users during the site's first 47 days reveals that users willingly share their time commitments despite an existing culture of restricted calendars.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "University of Minnesota", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Werner Geyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geyer:Werner", "Casey Dugan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dugan:Casey", "Beth Brownholtz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brownholtz:Beth", "Mikhil Masli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masli:Mikhil", "Elizabeth M.
