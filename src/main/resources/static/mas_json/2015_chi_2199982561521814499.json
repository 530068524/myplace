{"title": "HaptiCase: Back-of-Device Tactile Landmarks for Eyes-Free Absolute Indirect Touch.", "fields": ["touchscreen", "software", "mobile device", "computer vision", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "Using a smartphone for touch input to control apps and games mirrored to a distant screen is difficult, as the user cannot see where she is touching while looking at the distant display. We present HaptiCase, an interaction technique that provides back-of-device tactile landmarks that the user senses with her fingers to estimate the location of her finger in relation to the touchscreen. By pinching the thumb resting above the touch- screen to a finger at the back, the finger position is transferred to the front as the thumb touches the screen. In a study, we compared touch performance of different landmark layouts with a regular landmark-free mobile device. Using a land- mark design of dots on a 3x5 grid significantly improves eyes-free tapping accuracy and allows targets to be as small as 17.5 mm---a 14% reduction in target size---to cover 99% of all touches. When users can look at the touchscreen, land- marks have no significant effect on performance. HaptiCase is low-cost, requires no electronics, and works with unmodified software.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christian Corsten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corsten:Christian", "Christian Cherek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherek:Christian", "Thorsten Karrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karrer:Thorsten", "Jan O.
