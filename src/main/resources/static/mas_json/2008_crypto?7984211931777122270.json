In particular, we allow any polynomial-time adversary to read the entire ciphertext, and corrupt a constant fraction of the bits of the  entire ciphertext. Nevertheless, the decoding algorithm can recover any bit of the plaintext with all but negligible probability by reading only a sublinear number of bits of the (corrupted) ciphertext.\n\nWe give a general construction of a PKLDC from any Semantically-Secure Public Key Encryption (SS-PKE) and any Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol. Since Homomorphic encryption implies PIR, we also show a reduction from any Homomorphic encryption protocol to PKLDC.\n\nApplying our construction to the best known PIR protocol (that of Gentry and Ramzan), we obtain a PKLDC, which for messages of size  n and security parameter  k achieves ciphertexts of size $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, public key of size $\\mathcal{O}(n+k)$, and locality of size $\\mathcal{O}(k^2)$. This means that for messages of length  n =  i\u00be? ( k 2 +  i\u00be? ), we can decode a bit of the plaintext from a corrupted ciphertext while doing computation sublinear in  n .", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Brett Hemenway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hemenway:Brett", "Rafail Ostrovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrovsky:Rafail"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 18}
