{"title": "The electrum analyzer: model checking relational first-order temporal specifications.", "fields": ["spectrum analyzer", "bounded function", "model checking", "speedup", "operator"], "abstract": "This paper presents the Electrum Analyzer, a free-software tool to validate and perform model checking of Electrum specifications. Electrum is an extension of Alloy that enriches its relational logic with LTL operators, thus simplifying the specification of dynamic systems. The Analyzer supports both automatic bounded model checking, with an encoding into SAT, and unbounded model checking, with an encoding into SMV. Instance, or counter-example, traces are presented back to the user in a unified visualizer. Features to speed up model checking are offered, including a decomposed parallel solving strategy and the extraction of symbolic bounds.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "University of Minho", "University of Minho"], "authors": ["Julien Brunel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brunel:Julien", "David Chemouil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chemouil:David", "Alcino Cunha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cunha:Alcino", "Nuno Macedo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Macedo:Nuno"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
