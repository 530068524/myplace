{"title": "Interactive Performance as a Means of Civic Dialogue.", "fields": ["observational study", "social issues", "social engagement", "mobile technology", "civic engagement"], "abstract": "This paper presents a case study of an interactive performance that was produced and designed to encourage civic engagement and reflection in relation to the social tensions in a low-income suburb, mostly inhabited by people with immigrant backgrounds. The design of the technological setup in the performance encouraged participation by means of text entries that audience members could share with others. The analysis draws on the corpus of interview and observational data collected, as well as the related text messages that were shared during the performance. We illustrate the different levels at which citizens make sense of societal issues they are concerned about, as well as the audience-citizens' perception of participating in such an artistic experience.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stockholm University", "S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University", "IT University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chiara Rossitto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossitto:Chiara", "Maria Normark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Normark:Maria", "Louise Barkhuus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barkhuus:Louise"], "pages": 13}
