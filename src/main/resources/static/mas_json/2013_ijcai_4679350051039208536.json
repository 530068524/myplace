{"title": "Reasoning about Normative Update.", "fields": ["obligation", "machine learning", "normative", "norm", "sanctions"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of updating a multi-agent system with a set of conditional norms. A norm comes into effect when its condition becomes true, and imposes either an obligation or a prohibition on an agent which remains in force until a state satisfying a deadline condition is reached. If the norm is violated, a sanction is imposed on the agent. We define a notion of a normative update of a multi-agent system by a set of conditional norms, and study the problem of checking whether the agent(s) can bring about a state satisfying a property without incurring a specified number of sanctions.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "Utrecht University", "University of Nottingham"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Natasha Alechina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alechina:Natasha", "Mehdi Dastani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dastani:Mehdi", "Brian Logan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Logan:Brian"], "pages": 7}
