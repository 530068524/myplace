We implemented an analyzer based on \\(\\mathsf PDR ^{\\forall }\\), and applied it to a collection of list-manipulating programs. Our analyzer was able to automatically infer universal invariants strong enough to establish memory safety and certain functional correctness properties, show the absence of such invariants for certain natural programs and specifications, and detect bugs. All this, without the need for user-supplied abstraction predicates.\nOpen image in new window", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Tel Aviv University", "Aarhus University", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "The Academic Co ...
