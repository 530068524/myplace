Frequencies for unigrams, bigrams and trigrams are estimated for the entire word and for parts of it. Canonical Correlation Analysis is then used to match the estimated profile to the true profiles of all words in a large dictionary. The CNN that is used employs several novelties such as the use of multiple fully connected branches. Applied to all commonly used handwriting recognition benchmarks, our method outperforms, by a very large margin, all existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Arik Poznanski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poznanski:Arik", "Lior Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Lior"], "pages": 10}
