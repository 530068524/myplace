{"title": "Linear and Parallel Learning of Markov Random Fields.", "fields": ["embarrassingly parallel", "sufficient statistic", "random field", "log linear model", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We introduce a new embarrassingly parallel parameter learning algorithm for Markov random fields with untied parameters which is efficient for a large class of practical models. Our algorithm parallelizes naturally over cliques and, for graphs of bounded degree, its complexity is linear in the number of cliques. Unlike its competitors, our algorithm is fully parallel and for loglinear models it is also data efficient, requiring only the local sufficient statistics of the data to estimate parameters.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yariv Dror Mizrahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mizrahi:Yariv_Dror", "Misha Denil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denil:Misha", "Nando de Freitas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freitas:Nando_de"], "pages": 9}
