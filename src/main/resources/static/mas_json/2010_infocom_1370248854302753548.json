{"title": "Password Strength: An Empirical Analysis.", "fields": ["password psychology", "zero knowledge password proof", "password strength", "key stretching", "cognitive password"], "abstract": "It is a well known fact that user-chosen passwords are somewhat predictable: by using tools such as dictionaries or probabilistic models, attackers and password recovery tools can drastically reduce the number of attempts needed to guess a password. Quite surprisingly, however, existing literature does not provide a satisfying answer to the following question: given a number of guesses, what is the probability that a state-of-the-art attacker will be able to break a password? To answer the former question, we compare and evaluate the effectiveness of currently known attacks using various datasets of known passwords. We find that a \"diminishing returns\" principle applies: in the absence of an enforced password strength policy, weak passwords are common; on the other hand, as the attack goes on, the probability that a guess will succeed decreases by orders of magnitude. Even extremely powerful attackers won't be able to guess a substantial percentage of the passwords. The result of this work will help in evaluating the security of authentication means based on user- chosen passwords, and our methodology for estimating password strength can be used as a basis for creating more effective proactive password checkers for users and security auditing tools for administrators.", "citation": "Citations (208)", "departments": ["Institut Eur\u00e9com", "Institut Eur\u00e9com", "Institut Eur\u00e9com"], "authors": ["Matteo Dell'Amico.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dell=Amico:Matteo", "Pietro Michiardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michiardi:Pietro", "Yves Roudier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roudier:Yves"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
