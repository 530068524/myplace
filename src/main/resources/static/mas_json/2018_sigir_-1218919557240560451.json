{"title": "Do Not Pull My Data for Resale: Protecting Data Providers Using Data Retrieval Pattern Analysis.", "fields": ["feature engineering", "data retrieval", "copyright infringement", "information retrieval", "anomaly detection"], "abstract": "Data providers have a profound contribution to many fields such as finance, economy, and academia by serving people with both web-based and API-based query service of specialized data. Among the data users, there are data resellers who abuse the query APIs to retrieve and resell the data to make a profit, which harms the data provider's interests and causes copyright infringement. In this work, we define the \"anti-data-reselling\" problem and propose a new systematic method that combines feature engineering and machine learning models to provide a solution. We apply our method to a real query log of over 9,000 users with limited labels provided by a large financial data provider and get reasonable results, insightful observations, and real deployments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "AHI Fin-tech In ...
