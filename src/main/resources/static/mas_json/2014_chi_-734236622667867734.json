{"title": "Investigating the feasibility of extracting tool demonstrations from in-situ video content.", "fields": ["clips", "heuristic", "end user", "in situ", "workflow"], "abstract": "Short video demonstrations are effective resources for helping users to learn tools in feature-rich software. However manually creating demonstrations for the hundreds (or thousands) of individual features in these programs would be impractical. In this paper, we investigate the potential for identifying good tool demonstrations from within screen recordings of users performing real-world tasks. Using an instrumented image-editing application, we collected workflow video content and log data from actual end users. We then developed a heuristic for identifying demonstration clips, and had the quality of a sample set of clips evaluated by both domain experts and end users. This multi-step approach allowed us to characterize the quality of 'naturally occurring' tool demonstrations, and to derive a list of good and bad features of these videos. Finally, we conducted an initial investigation into using machine learning techniques to distinguish between good and bad demonstrations.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Autodesk", "Autodesk", "Autodesk"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ben Lafreniere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lafreniere:Ben", "Tovi Grossman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossman:Tovi", "Justin Matejka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matejka:Justin", "George W.
