In this paper, we present a pivot approach for extracting paraphrase patterns from bilingual parallel corpora, whereby the English paraphrase patterns are extracted using the sentences in a foreign language as pivots. We propose a loglinear model to compute the paraphrase likelihood of two patterns and exploit feature functions based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and lexical weighting (LW). Using the presented method, we extract over 1,000,000 pairs of paraphrase patterns from 2M bilingual sentence pairs, the precision of which exceeds 67%. The evaluation results show that: (1) The pivot approach is effective in extracting paraphrase patterns, which significantly outperforms the conventional method DIRT. Especially, the log-linear model with the proposed feature functions achieves high performance. (2) The coverage of the extracted paraphrase patterns is high, which is above 84%. (3) The extracted paraphrase patterns can be classified into 5 types, which are useful in various applications.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shiqi Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shiqi", "Haifeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haifeng", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ting", "Sheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Sheng"], "pages": 9}
