{"title": "Design-driven narrative: using stories to prototype and build immersive design worlds.", "fields": ["narrative inquiry", "immersion", "scenario analysis", "storytelling", "experience design"], "abstract": "This paper examines the role of narrative in the process of interactive experience design, focusing on the potential uses of narrative in prototyping and iteration efforts to uncover deeper and more meaningful responses from users by engaging them in the co-creation of narratives of use around the design. We created a series of narrative fictions with embedded design concepts, and built low-fi prototype artifacts for directed storytelling sessions with twelve participants. We conclude with a discussion of findings regarding the opportunities to more effectively use narrative techniques and immersive storytelling to create valuable experiences between designers and users.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["AT&T", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Eric Spaulding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spaulding:Eric", "Haakon Faste.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faste:Haakon"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
