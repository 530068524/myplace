{"title": "First Order-Rewritability and Containment of Conjunctive Queries in Horn Description Logics.", "fields": ["algorithm", "conjunctive query", "nexptime", "exptime", "boolean conjunctive query", "description logic", "mathematics", "ranging"], "abstract": "We study FO-rewritability of conjunctive queries in the presence of ontologies formulated in a description logic between EL and Horn-SHIF, along with related query containment problems. Apart from providing characterizations, we establish complexity results ranging from EXPTIME via NEXPTIME to 2EXPTIME, pointing out several interesting effects. In particular, FO-rewriting is more complex for conjunctive queries than for atomic queries when inverse roles are present, but not otherwise.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "University of Liverpool"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Meghyn Bienvenu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bienvenu:Meghyn", "Peter Hansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hansen_0002:Peter", "Carsten Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Carsten", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank"], "pages": 7}
