In [4] we have shown that LFP_{inv}, the ``order-invariant least fixed-point logic LFP,'' captures P (on all finite structures) if and only if there is a listing of the P subsets of the set TAUT of propositional tautologies. We are able to extend the result to listings of the L-subsets (NL-subsets) of TAUT and the logic DTC_{inv} (TC_{inv}). As a byproduct we get that LFP_{inv} captures P if DTC_{inv} captures L. Furthermore, we show that the existence of a listing of the L-subsets of TAUT is equivalent to the existence of an almost space optimal algorithm for TAUT. To obtain this result we have to derive a space version of a theorem of Levin on optimal inverters.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of Freiburg"], "authors": ["Yijia Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yijia", "J\u00f6rg Flum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flum:J=ouml=rg"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
