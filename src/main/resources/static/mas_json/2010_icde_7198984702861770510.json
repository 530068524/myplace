{"title": "XML reasoning made practical.", "fields": ["xpath", "xml schema editor", "xml schema", "xpath 2 0", "xml tree"], "abstract": "We present a tool for the static analysis of XPath queries and XML Schemas. The tool introduces techniques used in the field of verification (such as binary decision diagrams) in order to efficiently solve XPath query satisfiability, containment, and equivalence, in the presence of real-world XML Schemas. The tool can be used in query optimizers, in order to prove soundness of query rewriting. It can also be used in type-checkers and optimizing compilers that need to perform all kinds of compile-time analyses involving XPath queries and XML tree constraints.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Pierre Genev\u00e8s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Genev=egrave=s:Pierre", "Nabil Laya\u00efda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laya=iuml=da:Nabil"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
