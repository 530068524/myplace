However, KN smoothing assumes integer counts, limiting its potential uses\u2014for example, inside Expectation-Maximization. In this paper, we propose a generalization of KN smoothing that operates on fractional counts, or, more precisely, on distributions over counts. We rederive all the steps of KN smoothing to operate on count distributions instead of integral counts, and apply it to two tasks where KN smoothing was not applicable before: one in language model adaptation, and the other in word alignment. In both cases, our method improves performance significantly.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Information Sciences Institute", "Information Sciences Institute"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hui", "David Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang_0001:David"], "pages": 10}
