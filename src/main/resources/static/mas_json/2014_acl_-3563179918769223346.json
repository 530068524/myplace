A set of linguistic rules is defined to explore implicit phrase structural information and thus build high-quality GR annotations that are represented as general directed dependency graphs. The reliability of this linguistically-motivated GR extraction procedure is highlighted by manual evaluation. Based on the converted corpus, we study transition-based, datadriven models for GR parsing. We present a novel transition system which suits GR graphs better than existing systems. The key idea is to introduce a new type of transition that reorders top k elements in the memory module. Evaluation gauges how successful GR parsing for Chinese can be by applying datadriven models.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Weiwei Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Weiwei", "Yantao Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Yantao", "Xin Kou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kou:Xin", "Shuoyang Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Shuoyang", "Xiaojun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan_0001:Xiaojun"], "pages": 21}
