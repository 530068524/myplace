{"title": "Twitter+: Build personalized newspaper for Twitter.", "fields": ["newspaper", "timeline", "microblogging", "publication", "social media"], "abstract": "Nowadays, microblogging services, e.g., Twitter, have played important roles in people's everyday lives. It enables users to publish and read text-based posts, known as \u201ctweets\u201d and interact with each other through re-tweeting or commenting. In the literature, many efforts have been devoted on exploiting the social property of Twitter. However, except the social component, Twitter itself has become an indispensable source for users to acquire useful information. To maximize its value, we expect to pay more attention on the media property of Twitter. To be good media, the first requirement is that it should provide an effective presentation of its news so that users are facilitated of reading. Currently, all tweets from followings are presented to the users and usually organized by their published timelines or coming sources. However, too few dimensions of presenting tweets hinder users from finding their interested information conveniently. In this demo, we presents \u201cTwitter+\u201d, which aims to enrich user's reading experiences in Twitter by providing multiple ways for them to explore tweets, such as keyword presentation, topic finding. It presents users an alternative interface to browse tweets more effectively.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Chen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chen", "Anthony K.
