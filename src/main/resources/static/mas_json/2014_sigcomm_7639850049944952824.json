Unlike prior RDMA-based key-value systems, HERD focuses its design on reducing network round trips while using efficient RDMA primitives; the result is substantially lower latency, and throughput that saturates modern, commodity RDMA hardware.   HERD has two unconventional decisions: First, it does not use RDMA reads, despite the allure of operations that bypass the remote CPU entirely. Second, it uses a mix of RDMA and messaging verbs, despite the conventional wisdom that the messaging primitives are slow. A HERD client writes its request into the server's memory; the server computes the reply. This design uses a single round trip for all requests and supports up to 26 million key-value operations per second with 5\u03bcs average latency. Notably, for small key-value items, our full system throughput is similar to native RDMA read throughput and is over 2X higher than recent RDMA-based key-value systems. We believe that HERD further serves as an effective template for the construction of RDMA-based datacenter services.", "citation": "Citations (166)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Intel", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Anuj Kalia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalia:Anuj", "Michael Kaminsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaminsky:Michael", "David G.
