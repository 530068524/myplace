For directed graphs with bounded degree, there are two different models in property testing introduced by Bender and Ron (2002). In the  bidirectional model , one can access both incoming and outgoing edges while in the  unidirectional model  one can only access outgoing edges. In our paper we provide a new relation between the two models: we prove that if a property can be tested with  constant query complexity  in the bidirectional model, then it can be tested with  sublinear query complexity  in the unidirectional model. A corollary of this result is that in the unidirectional model (the model allowing only queries to the outgoing neighbors), every property in hyperfinite digraphs is testable with sublinear query complexity.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Technical University of Dortmund"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Artur Czumaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czumaj:Artur", "Pan Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Pan", "Christian Sohler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohler:Christian"], "pages": 13}
