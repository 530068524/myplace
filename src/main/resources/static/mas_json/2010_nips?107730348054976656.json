Firing patterns of the membrane stimulated by a step current are analyzed in transistor level simulations and in silicon on a prototype chip. The neuron is destined to be the hardware neuron of a highly integrated wafer-scale system reaching out for new computational paradigms and opening new experimentation possibilities. As the neuron is dedicated as a universal device for neuroscientific experiments, the focus lays on parameterizability and reproduction of the analytical model.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University"], "authors": ["Sebastian Millner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Millner:Sebastian", "Andreas Gr\u00fcbl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=uuml=bl:Andreas", "Karlheinz Meier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meier:Karlheinz", "Johannes Schemmel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schemmel:Johannes", "Marc-Olivier Schwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwartz:Marc=Olivier"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
