In this paper we propose a methodology to drive the adaptation of such a system, that integrates within a unified framework different adaptation mechanisms, to achieve a greater flexibility in facing different operating environments and the possibly conflicting QoS requirements of several concurrent users. To determine the most suitable adaptation action(s), the methodology is based on the formulation and solution of a linear programming problem, which is derived from a behavioral model of the system updated at runtime by a monitoring activity. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of our approach. Besides the methodology, we also present a prototype tool that implements it.", "citation": "Citations (140)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Universit\u00e0 di R ... ma, Roma, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 di R ... ma, Roma, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 di R ... ma, Roma, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 di R ... ma, Roma, Italy"], "authors": ["Valeria Cardellini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cardellini:Valeria", "Emiliano Casalicchio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casalicchio:Emiliano", "Vincenzo Grassi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grassi:Vincenzo", "Francesco Lo Presti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Presti:Francesco_Lo", "Raffaela Mirandola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirandola:Raffaela"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
