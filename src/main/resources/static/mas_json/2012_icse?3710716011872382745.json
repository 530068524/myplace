Since each operation is specified separately in terms of an abstract implementation, it may be hard to understand and validate the resulting component behavior from contracts in terms of method interactions. In particular, properties expressed through algebraic axioms, which specify the effect of sequences of operations, require complex theorem proving techniques to be validated. In this paper, we propose an automatic small-scope based approach to synthesize incomplete behavioral abstractions for contracts expressed in the JFSL notation. The proposed abstraction technique enables the possibility to check that the contract behavior is coherent with behavioral properties expressed as axioms of an algebraic specifications. We assess the applicability of our approach by showing how the synthesis methodology can be applied to some classes of contract-based artifacts like specifications of data abstractions and requirement engineering models.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Carlo Ghezzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghezzi:Carlo", "Andrea Mocci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mocci:Andrea"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 11}
