{"title": "ProCom: Designing and Evaluating a Mobile and Wearable System to Support Proximity Awareness for People with Autism.", "fields": ["wearable computer", "social skills", "iterative design", "social isolation", "self monitoring"], "abstract": "People with autism are at risk for social isolation due to differences in their perception and engagement with the social world. In this work, we aim to address one specific concern related to socialization the understanding, awareness, and use of interpersonal space. Over the course of a year, we iteratively designed and tested a series of concepts for supporting children with autism in perceiving, understanding, and responding to physical proximity with other people. During this process, we developed ProCom, a prototype system for measuring proximity without requiring instrumentation of the environment or another person. We used a variety of low and high fidelity prototypes, culminating in ProCom, to assess the feasibility, utility, and challenges of this approach. The results of these iterative design engagements indicate that wearable assistive technologies can support people in developing awareness of physical proximity in social settings. However, challenges related to both personal and collective use remain", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["LouAnne E.
