But considering dynamic appearance of objects or clutter background, the integration based on constant weights may weaken the performance of this scheme. In this paper, we propose a dynamic weights update mechanism for multiple cues tracking with detection responses as supervision. We integrate multiple cues based on the observation hypotheses compared with detection association results and adjust the weights according to the approximation degree. The integration is adapted on-the-fly during tracking, in order to keep the tracker adaptive. The proposed method allows flexible combination of different cues and we select cues based on color and local feature for tracking. Experiments are carried out on 602 trajectories extracted from TRECVID 2008 event detection dataset which is recorded in an airport scenario. Comparison results prove the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Guochen Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Guochen", "Yonghong Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Yonghong", "Yaowei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yaowei", "Tiejun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Tiejun", "Min Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Min"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
