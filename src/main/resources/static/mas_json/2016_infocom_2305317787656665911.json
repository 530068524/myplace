We transform MApId into an information-retrieval problem where lexical similarity of short-text-documents is used as a metric for classification tasks. Specifically, a network-flow, observed at an intercept-point, is treated as a semi-structured-text-document and modified into a flow-query. This query is then run against a corpus of documents pre-indexed in a search-engine. Each index-document represents an application, and consists of distinguishable identifiers from the metadata-file and URL-strings found in the application's executable-archive. The search-engine acts as a kernel function, generating a score distribution vis-'a-vis the index-documents, to determine a match. This extends the scope of MApId to fuzzy-classification mapping a flow to a family of apps when the score distribution is spread-out. Through experiments over an emulator-generated test-dataset (400 K applications and 13.5 million flows), we obtain over 80% flow coverage and about 85% application coverage with low false-positives (4%) and nearly no false-negatives. We also validate our methodology over a real network trace. Most importantly, our methodology is platform agnostic, and subsumes previous studies, most of which focus solely on the application coverage.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Symantec", "Symantec", "Symantec"], "authors": ["Gyan Ranjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranjan:Gyan", "Alok Tongaonkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tongaonkar:Alok", "Ruben Torres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torres:Ruben"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
