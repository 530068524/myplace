Our construction works for any polynomial number of encryption slots and achieves adaptive security against unbounded collusion, while relying on standard polynomial hardness assumptions. Prior to this work, we did not even have a candidate for 3-slot MIFE for inner products in the generic bilinear group model. Our work is also the first MIFE scheme for a non-trivial functionality based on standard cryptographic assumptions, as well as the first to achieve polynomial security loss for a super-constant number of slots under falsifiable assumptions. Prior works required stronger non-standard assumptions such as indistinguishability obfuscation or multi-linear maps.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["PSL Research University", "Yale University", "PSL Research University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Michel Abdalla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdalla:Michel", "Romain Gay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gay:Romain", "Mariana Raykova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raykova_0001:Mariana", "Hoeteck Wee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wee:Hoeteck"], "pages": 26}
