Traditional face super-resolution algorithms only use the difference of image pixel values as similarity criterion, which degrades similarity and identification of reconstructed facial images. Image semantic information with human understanding, especially structural data of shapes, is robust to the degraded images. In this paper, we propose a face hallucination with shape parameters projection constraint. This method uses a parameter model to represent face shapes, and shape information of input image is introduced to improving the quality of reconstructed image. The shape model regularization is first added to original objective function. Then shape parameters are projected into the domain of image parameters by a linear regression model. Finally, the gradient descent method is used to obtain the unified parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the traditional schemes significantly both in subjective and objective quality.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Wuhan University", "Wuhan University", "Wuhan University", "Wuhan University"], "authors": ["Chengdong Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Chengdong", "Ruimin Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Ruimin", "Kebin Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Kebin", "Zhen Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Zhen"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
