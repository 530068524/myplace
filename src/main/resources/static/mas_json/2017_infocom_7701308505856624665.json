Specifically, our proposed class of Dual-Delay (DD) codes can recover from challenging long bursts of losses with close to theoretical minimum delay so as to meet playback deadlines for recovered packets. They further improve conversational interactivity by achieving lower recovery delay during periods of random isolated losses. These DD codes are shown to achieve lower residual loss rates when compared to existing codes over a wide range of parameters of the Gilbert-Elliott channel. Experiments over real world packet traces further show performance gains of DD codes in terms of perceptually motivated ITU-T G.107 E-model.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Cisco Systems, Inc.", "Cisco Systems, Inc.", "Cisco Systems, Inc."], "authors": ["Ahmed Badr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badr:Ahmed", "Ashish Khisti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khisti:Ashish", "Wai-tian Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Wai=tian", "Xiaoqing Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoqing", "John G.
