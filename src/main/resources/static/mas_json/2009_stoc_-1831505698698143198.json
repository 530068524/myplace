Further applications include, among other things, finding a constrained form of matrix rigidity and maximum likelihood decoding of an error correcting code. As another application of our method we give the first linear time approximation schemes for correlation clustering with a fixed number of clusters and its hierarchical generalization. Our results depend on a new technique for dealing with small objective function values of optimization problems and could be of independent interest.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Bonn", "Brown University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Marek Karpinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karpinski:Marek", "Warren Schudy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schudy:Warren"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
