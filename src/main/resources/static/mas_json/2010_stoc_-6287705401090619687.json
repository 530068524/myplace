We show that every communication protocol that communicates $C$ bits and reveals $I$ bits of information about the inputs to the participating parties can be simulated by a new protocol involving at most $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{CI})$ bits of communication. If the protocol reveals $I$ bits of information about the inputs to an observer that watches the communication in the protocol, we show how to carry out the simulation with $\\tilde{O}(I)$ bits of communication. These results lead to a direct sum theorem for randomized communication complexity. Ignoring polylogarithmic factors, we show that for worst-case computation, computing $n$ copies of a function requires $\\sqrt{n}$ times the communication required for computing one copy of the function. For average case complexity, given any distribution $\\mu$ on inputs, computing $n$ copies of the function on $n$ inputs sampled independently according...", "citation": "Citations (179)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Princeton University", "Columbia University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Microsoft", "University of Southern California", "University of Washington"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Boaz Barak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barak:Boaz", "Mark Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Mark", "Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xi", "Anup Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Anup"], "pages": 10}
