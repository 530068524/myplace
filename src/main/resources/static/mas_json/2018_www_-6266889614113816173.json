{"title": "Estimating the Cardinality of Conjunctive Queries over RDF Data Using Graph Summarisation.", "fields": ["conjunctive query", "cardinality", "sparql", "joins", "rdf"], "abstract": "Accurately estimating the cardinality (i.e., the number of answers) of conjunctive queries is a core problem in data management. Common solutions to this problem are susceptible to high estimation errors that compound exponentially with the number of joins; hence, existing techniques can be inaccurate in data models such as RDF where queries are navigational and often involve many (self-)joins. In this paper we present a new technique for estimating the cardinality of conjunctive queries in RDF. We use a summary of an RDF graph as a synopsis that we interpret using a possible world semantics. We formalise the estimation problem as computing the expectation of query cardinality over all RDF graphs represented by the summary, and we present a closed-form formula for computing the expectation of arbitrary queries. We also discuss approaches to RDF graph summarisation. Finally, we show empirically that our cardinality technique is more accurate and more consistent, often by orders of magnitude, than several state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Bloomberg L.P.", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Giorgio Stefanoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefanoni:Giorgio", "Boris Motik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motik:Boris", "Egor V.
