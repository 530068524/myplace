First, we prove that the popular model of Dawid and Skene, which assumes that all classifiers are conditionally independent, is equivalent to a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with a single hidden node. Hence, under this model, the posterior probabilities of the true labels can be instead estimated via a trained RBM. Next, to address the more general case, where classifiers may strongly violate the conditional independence assumption, we propose to apply RBM-based Deep Neural Net (DNN). Experimental results on various simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed DNN approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, in particular when the data violates the conditional independence assumption.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Uri Shaham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shaham:Uri", "Xiuyuan Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiuyuan", "Omer Dror.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dror:Omer", "Ariel Jaffe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaffe:Ariel", "Boaz Nadler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nadler:Boaz", "Joseph T.
