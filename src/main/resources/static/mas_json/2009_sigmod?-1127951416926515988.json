This development opens new ways for addressing complex information needs. Search is no longer limited to matching keywords against documents, but instead complex information needs can be expressed in a structured way, with precise answers as results. In this paper, we demonstrate Hermes, an infrastructure for data web search. To provide an end-user oriented interface, we support expressive keyword search by translating user information needs into structured queries. We integrate heterogeneous web data sources with automatically computed mappings. Schema-level mappings are exploited in constructing structured queries against the integrated schema. These structured queries are decomposed into queries against the local web data sources, which are then processed in a distributed way.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Haofen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haofen", "Thomas Penin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Penin:Thomas", "Kaifeng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Kaifeng", "Junquan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Junquan", "Xinruo Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Xinruo", "Linyun Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Linyun", "Qiaoling Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qiaoling", "Yong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yong", "Thanh Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran_0001:Thanh", "Peter Haase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haase_0001:Peter", "Rudi Studer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Studer:Rudi"], "pages": 4}
