{"title": "Searchable Objects: Search in Everyday Conversation.", "fields": ["conversation", "narrative", "the internet", "information system", "mobile search"], "abstract": "This paper examines mobile internet search, presenting search not as a process of information retrieval, but as part of conversation and talk. Through video extracts of mobile search we explore how mobile phones are interwoven into talk, and how searchers manage the participation of other conversationalists alongside the search itself. We introduce the notion of a 'searchable object' -- an object that arises in conversation that can be searched for online -- and document how such an object occasions a search. In turn we discuss the differing roles of the device 'driver' and 'passenger', and how participation is managed through questions and narration. Rather than search being solely about getting correct information, conversations around search may be just as important. We conclude by critiquing some of the pessimistic views of interaction around mobile phones and their use in ordinary life and talk.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Stockholm University", "Stockholm University", "Stockholm University"], "authors": ["Barry A.
