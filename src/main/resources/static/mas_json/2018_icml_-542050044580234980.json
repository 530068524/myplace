First, lower bounds on the size of a network are established in terms of the approximation error and network depth and width. These bounds improve upon state-of-the-art bounds for certain classes of functions, such as strongly convex functions. Second, an upper bound is established on the difference of two neural networks with identical weights but different activation functions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Sharif University of Technology", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Mohammad Mehrabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehrabi:Mohammad", "Aslan Tchamkerten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tchamkerten:Aslan", "Mansoor I.
