Although future concentrations, damages and costs are unknown, it is widely recognized that major emissions reduction efforts are needed. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol promoted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, aimed at fighting global warming. The main goal is \u201cstabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\u201d [9]. According to the International Energy Agency [1], energy efficient in buildings, industrial processes and transportation could reduce the world\u2019s energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help controlling global emissions of greenhouse gases. The report [1] describes a series of scenarios showing how key energy technologies can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas which is most responsible for climate change. Of the four primary GHG under scrutiny, carbon dioxide (CO2), and the need to lower carbon emissions in general, is of paramount concern. It is estimated that transportation activities are responsible for approximately 25% to 30% of total U.S. GHG emissions, with the on-highway commercial truck market accounting for over 45% of transportation GHG. However, the transportation sector emissions remain almost entirely unaddressed with respect to GHG and CO2 reduction. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provided guidelines for calculating carbon emission offer estimations only for certain common types of fuels; even the", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore", "IBM", "University Port ...
