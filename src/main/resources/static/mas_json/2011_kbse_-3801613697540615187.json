However, our investigation proved that most software resources on the Internet did not provide enough quality descriptions. In this paper, we propose an approach to help developers judge a software resource's quality based on comments. In our approach, the software resources' comments on the Internet are automatically collected, the sentiment polarity (positive or negative) of a comment is identified and the quality aspects which the comment talks about are extracted. As a result, the merits and drawbacks of software resources are drew out which could help developers judge a software resource's quality in the process of software resource selection and reuse. To evaluate our approach, we applied our method to a group of open source software and the results showed that our method achieved satisfying precision in merits and drawbacks finding.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Changsheng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Changsheng", "Yanzhen Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou:Yanzhen", "Sibo Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Sibo", "Bing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Bing", "Hong Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Hong"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
