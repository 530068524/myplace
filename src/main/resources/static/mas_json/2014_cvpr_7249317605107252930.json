Much progress has been made w.r.t. many aspects of imaging, but the reconstruction of refractive phenomena, such as turbulence, gas and heat flows, liquids, or transparent solids, has remained a challenging problem. In this paper, we derive an intuitive formulation of light transport in refractive media using light fields and the transport of intensity equation. We show how coded illumination in combination with pairs of recorded images allow for robust computational reconstruction of dynamic two and three-dimensional refractive phenomena.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chenguang Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Chenguang", "Xing Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xing", "Jin-Li Suo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suo:Jin=Li", "Qionghai Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Qionghai", "Gordon Wetzstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wetzstein:Gordon"], "pages": 8}
