The developer provides two independent inputs: 1) an algorithm that ignores memory hierarchy and external storage aspects; and 2) a description of the target memory hierarchy, including its topology and parameters. Our system is able to automatically synthesize memory-hierarchy and storage-device-aware algorithms out of those specifications, for tasks such as joins and sorting. The framework is extensible and allows developers to quickly synthesize custom out-of-core algorithms as new storage technologies become available.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yannis Klonatos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klonatos:Yannis", "Andres N\u00f6tzli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/N=ouml=tzli:Andres", "Andrej Spielmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spielmann:Andrej", "Christoph Koch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koch_0001:Christoph", "Viktor Kuncak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuncak:Viktor"], "pages": 12}
