{"title": "Constituency to Dependency Translation with Forests.", "fields": ["bleu", "syntax", "popularity", "grammaticality", "language model"], "abstract": "Tree-to-string systems (and their forest-based extensions) have gained steady popularity thanks to their simplicity and efficiency, but there is a major limitation: they are unable to guarantee the grammaticality of the output, which is explicitly modeled in string-to-tree systems via target-side syntax. We thus propose to combine the advantages of both, and present a novel constituency-to-dependency translation model, which uses constituency forests on the source side to direct the translation, and dependency trees on the target side (as a language model) to ensure grammaticality. Medium-scale experiments show an absolute and statistically significant improvement of +0.7 BLEU points over a state-of-the-art forest-based tree-to-string system even with fewer rules. This is also the first time that a tree-to-tree model can surpass tree-to-string counterparts.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Haitao Mi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mi:Haitao", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun"], "pages": 10}
