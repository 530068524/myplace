{"title": "Infrastructuring and the Challenge of Dynamic Seams in Mobile Knowledge Work.", "fields": ["negotiation", "ubiquitous computing", "bridging", "sociotechnical system", "mobile technology"], "abstract": "Highly mobile knowledge workers spend a large portion of their time traversing within and among different infrastructural configurations as they move through space. These dynamic configurations are experienced as either technological or contextual constraints, which range from forms of technological exclusion and infrastructural disconnection to divides caused by both spatial and organizational boundaries. The workaday nature of these constrained environments force mobile workers to engage in a type of articulation work that involves the construction of bridging, assembling, or circumventing solutions to repeatedly negotiate these impediments. Engaging in these \u00e2  infrastructuring\u00e2   practices requires that workers develop \u00e2  infrastructural competence\u00e2  \u00e2  knowledge of the generative possibilities of infrastructural seams. In effect, this renders mobile workers as infrastructural bricoleurs. We discuss the implications of this required competence and speculate regarding its origin, maintenance, and differentiation among professions.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Ingrid Erickson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erickson:Ingrid", "Mohammad Hossein Jarrahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jarrahi:Mohammad_Hossein"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
