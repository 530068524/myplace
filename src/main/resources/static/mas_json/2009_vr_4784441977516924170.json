{"title": "Relating Scene-Motion Thresholds to Latency Thresholds for Head-Mounted Displays.", "fields": ["immersion", "latency", "perception", "pixel", "low latency"], "abstract": "As users of head-tracked head-mounted display systems move their heads, latency causes unnatural scene motion. We 1) analyzed scene motion due to latency and head motion, 2) developed a mathematical model relating latency, head motion, scene motion, and perception thresholds, 3) developed procedures to determine perceptual thresholds of scene-velocity and latency without the need for a head-mounted display or a low-latency system, and 4), for six subjects under a specific set of conditions, we measured scene-velocity and latency thresholds and compared the relationship between these thresholds. Resulting PSEs (min 10 ms) and JNDs (min 3 ms) of latency thresholds are in a similar range reported by Ellis and Adelstein. The results are a step toward enabling scientists and engineers to determine latency requirements before building immersive virtual environments using head-mounted display systems.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Jason Jerald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jerald:Jason", "Mary C.
