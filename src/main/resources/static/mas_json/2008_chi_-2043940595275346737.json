To increase the level of control with pressure input, we designed and evaluated four different discretization functions: linear, fisheye, visual fisheye, and clustered. The fisheye discretization dynamically modifies the range of pressure values based on the position of the pressure cursor. Our results show that a fisheye function results in significantly lower error rates and a lower number of crossings than have been reported in the literature. Furthermore, the fisheye function improves control without compromising speed. We discuss the findings of our study and identify several design recommendations for integrating pressure control into common interface tasks.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Manitoba", "University of Manitoba", "University of Manitoba", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kang Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Kang", "Pourang Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Pourang", "Sean Gustafson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gustafson:Sean", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram"], "pages": 4}
