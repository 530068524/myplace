GoalBit is an open source peer-to-peer distribution system of real-time video streams over Internet. The main advantage of a P2P architecture is the possibility of using available upload bandwidth in the hosts connected. The main difficulty is that these hosts are typically highly dynamic, they continuously enter and leave the network. To deal with this problem a mesh connectivity approach is used (Bittorrent-like) where the stream is decomposed into several pieces and shared between different peers. Nowadays, the GoalBit platform is used by operators and by final users to broadcast their live contents. To illustrate its potential, we present some empirical results measured in an emulation of a GoalBit P2P streaming, with more than 300 peers concurrently connected.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["GoalBit-Solutio ... evideo, Uruguay", "GoalBit-Solutio ... evideo, Uruguay", "GoalBit-Solutio ... evideo, Uruguay", "Facultad de Ing ... evideo, Uruguay", "GoalBit-Solutio ... evideo, Uruguay"], "authors": ["Andr\u00e9s Barrios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barrios:Andr=eacute=s", "Mat\u00edas Barrios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barrios:Mat=iacute=as", "Daniel De Vera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vera:Daniel_De", "Pablo Rodr\u00edguez-Bocca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodr=iacute=guez=Bocca:Pablo", "Claudia Rostagnol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rostagnol:Claudia"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
