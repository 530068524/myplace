Given an input image, we retrieve its best matches from a large database with annotated images using our modified, coarse-to-fine SIFT flow algorithm that aligns the structures within two images. Based on the dense scene correspondence obtained from the SIFT flow, our system warps the existing annotations, and integrates multiple cues in a Markov random field framework to segment and recognize the query image. Promising experimental results have been achieved by our nonparametric scene parsing system on a challenging database. Compared to existing object recognition approaches that require training for each object category, our system is easy to implement, has few parameters, and embeds contextual information naturally in the retrieval/alignment procedure.", "citation": "Citations (325)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ce Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ce", "Jenny Yuen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuen:Jenny", "Antonio Torralba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torralba_0001:Antonio"], "pages": 8}
