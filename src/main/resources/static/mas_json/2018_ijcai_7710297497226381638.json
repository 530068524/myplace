{"title": "Rethinking Diversified and Discriminative Proposal Generation for Visual Grounding.", "fields": ["phrase", "machine learning", "discriminative model", "pattern recognition", "ranking"], "abstract": "Visual grounding aims to localize an object in an image referred to by a textual query phrase. Various visual grounding approaches have been proposed, and the problem can be modularized into a general framework: proposal generation, multi-modal feature representation, and proposal ranking. Of these three modules, most existing approaches focus on the latter two, with the importance of proposal generation generally neglected. In this paper, we rethink the problem of what properties make a good proposal generator. We introduce the diversity and discrimination simultaneously when generating proposals, and in doing so propose Diversified and Discriminative Proposal Networks model (DDPN). Based on the proposals generated by DDPN, we propose a high performance baseline model for visual grounding and evaluate it on four benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model delivers significant improvements on all the tested data-sets (e.g., 18.8\\% improvement on ReferItGame and 8.2\\% improvement on Flickr30k Entities over the existing state-of-the-arts respectively)", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hangzhou Dianzi University", "Hangzhou Dianzi University", "Hangzhou Dianzi University", "Zhejiang University", "University of Texas at San Antonio"], "authors": ["Zhou Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Zhou", "Jun Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jun", "Chenchao Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Chenchao", "Zhou Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhou", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi", "Dacheng Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Dacheng"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
