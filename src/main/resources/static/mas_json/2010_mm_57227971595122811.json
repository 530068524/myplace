{"title": "NudgeCam: toward targeted, higher quality media capture.", "fields": ["heuristics", "android", "multimedia", "computer science", "sound quality"], "abstract": "NudgeCam is a mobile application that can help users capture more relevant, higher quality media. To guide users to capture media more relevant to a particular project, third-party template creators can show users media that demonstrates relevant content and can tell users what content should be present in each captured media using tags and other meta-data such as location and camera orientation. To encourage higher quality media capture, NudgeCam provides real time feedback based on standard media capture heuristics, including face positioning, pan speed, audio quality, and many others. We describe an implementation of NudgeCam on the Android platform as well as field deployments of the application.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Scott Carter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carter:Scott", "John Adcock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adcock:John", "John Doherty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doherty:John", "Stacy M.
