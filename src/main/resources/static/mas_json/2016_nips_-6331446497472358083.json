{"title": "Learning Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models with Overlapping Blocks.", "fields": ["data matrix", "coordinate descent", "connected component", "gaussian", "graphical model"], "abstract": "We present a novel framework, called GRAB (GRaphical models with overlApping Blocks), to capture densely connected components in a network estimate. GRAB takes as input a data matrix of p variables and n samples, and jointly learns both a network among p variables and densely connected groups of variables (called `blocks'). GRAB has four major novelties as compared to existing network estimation methods: 1) It does not require the blocks to be given a priori. 2) Blocks can overlap. 3) It can jointly learn a network structure and overlapping blocks. 4) It solves a joint optimization problem with the block coordinate descent method that is convex in each step. We show that GRAB reveals the underlying network structure substantially better than four state-of-the-art competitors on synthetic data. When applied to cancer gene expression data, GRAB outperforms its competitors in revealing known functional gene sets and potentially novel genes that drive cancer.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Washington"], "authors": ["Mohammad Javad Hosseini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosseini:Mohammad_Javad", "Su-In Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Su=In"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
