{"title": "Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Selectional Branching.", "fields": ["parser combinator", "beam search", "top down parsing", "bottom up parsing", "dependency grammar"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach, called selectional branching, which uses confidence estimates to decide when to employ a beam, providing the accuracy of beam search at speeds close to a greedy transition-based dependency parsing approach. Selectional branching is guaranteed to perform a fewer number of transitions than beam search yet performs as accurately. We also present a new transition-based dependency parsing algorithm that gives a complexity ofO(n) for projective parsing and an expected linear time speed for non-projective parsing. With the standard setup, our parser shows an unlabeled attachment score of 92.96% and a parsing speed of 9 milliseconds per sentence, which is faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art transitionbased parser that uses beam search.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jinho D.
