However, it is often difficult to manually specify the set of features that can make the true reward function representable as a linear function. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to identifying useful composite features for learning the reward function. The composite features are assumed to be the logical conjunctions of the pre-defined atomic features so that we can represent the reward function as a linear function of the composite features. We empirically show that our approach is able to learn composite features that capture important aspects of the reward function on synthetic domains, and predict taxi drivers' behaviour with high accuracy on a real GPS trace dataset.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jaedeug Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jaedeug", "Kee-Eung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kee=Eung"], "pages": 7}
