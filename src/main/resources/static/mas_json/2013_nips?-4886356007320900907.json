The typical approach is to use the posterior distribution on the number of clusters \u2014 that is, the posterior on the number of components represented in the observed data. However, it turns out that this posterior is not consistent \u2014 it does not concentrate at the true number of components. In this note, we give an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a DPM with normal components of unit variance, applied to data from a \"mixture\" with one standard normal component. Further, we show that this example exhibits severe inconsistency: instead of going to 1, the posterior probability that there is one cluster converges (in probability) to 0.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University"], "authors": ["Jeffrey W.
