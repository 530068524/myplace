We observed that the presence of meters yielded significantly stronger passwords. We performed a followup field experiment to test a different scenario: creating a password for an unimportant account. In this scenario, we found that the meters made no observable difference: participants simply reused weak passwords that they used to protect similar low-risk accounts. We conclude that meters result in stronger passwords when users are forced to change existing passwords on \"important\" accounts and that individual meter design decisions likely have a marginal impact.", "citation": "Citations (148)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Serge Egelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egelman:Serge", "Andreas Sotirakopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sotirakopoulos:Andreas", "Ildar Muslukhov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muslukhov:Ildar", "Konstantin Beznosov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beznosov:Konstantin", "Cormac Herley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herley:Cormac"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
