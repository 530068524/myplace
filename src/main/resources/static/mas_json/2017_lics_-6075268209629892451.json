{"title": "Effectful applicative bisimilarity: Monads, relators, and Howe's method.", "fields": ["monad", "equivalence", "algebraic number", "congruence", "operational semantics"], "abstract": "We study Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity abstractly, in the context of call-by-value \u03bb-calculi with algebraic effects. We first of all endow a computational \u03bb-calculus with a monadic operational semantics. We then show how the theory of relators provides precisely what is needed to generalise applicative bisimilarity to such a calculus, and to single out those monads and relators for which applicative bisimilarity is a congruence, thus a sound methodology for program equivalence. This is done by studying Howe's method in the abstract.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "University of Bologna", "University of Birmingham"], "authors": ["Ugo Dal Lago.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lago:Ugo_Dal", "Francesco Gavazzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavazzo:Francesco", "Paul Blain Levy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levy:Paul_Blain"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
