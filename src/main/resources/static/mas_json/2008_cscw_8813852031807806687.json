{"title": "An examination of daily information needs and sharing opportunities.", "fields": ["information needs", "interpersonal ties", "group information management", "information sharing", "asynchronous communication"], "abstract": "A person often has highly context-sensitive information needs that require assistance from individuals in their social network. However, a person's social network is often not broad enough to include the right people in the right situations or circumstances who can satisfy the needs. The ability to satisfy context-sensitive information needs depends on a person's ability to seek the answers from appropriate individuals, who must then provide a response in a timely manner. To gain an understanding of how to better support the sharing of information, we conducted a four-week diary study examining 20 people's perceived daily information needs and sharing desires. We provide a structured framework for understanding the types of information people need and discuss when and how people are able to satisfy their needs. Using these findings, we discuss research and design opportunities for addressing the shortcomings of the existing information sources by connecting information altruists with an audience by leveraging weak ties through situation and circumstance, and providing a timely asynchronous connection to these sources.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Google", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["David Dearman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dearman:David", "Melanie Kellar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kellar:Melanie", "Khai N.
