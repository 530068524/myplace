{"title": "The Constant Inapproximability of the Parameterized Dominating Set Problem.", "fields": ["exponential time hypothesis", "time complexity", "dominating set", "parameterized complexity", "complete bipartite graph"], "abstract": "We prove that there is no fpt-algorithm that can approximate the dominating set problem with any constant ratio, unless FPT = W[1]. Our hardness reduction is built on the second author's recent W[1]-hardness proof of the biclique problem [25]. This yields, among other things, a proof without the PCP machinery that the classical dominating set problem has no polynomial time constant approximation under the exponential time hypothesis.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Yijia Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yijia", "Bingkai Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Bingkai"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
