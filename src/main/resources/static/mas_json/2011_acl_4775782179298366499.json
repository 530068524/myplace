{"title": "Semi-supervised Relation Extraction with Large-scale Word Clustering.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "machine learning", "cluster analysis", "relationship extraction", "granularity"], "abstract": "We present a simple semi-supervised relation extraction system with large-scale word clustering. We focus on systematically exploring the effectiveness of different cluster-based features. We also propose several statistical methods for selecting clusters at an appropriate level of granularity. When training on different sizes of data, our semi-supervised approach consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art supervised baseline system.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ang Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Ang", "Ralph Grishman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grishman:Ralph", "Satoshi Sekine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sekine:Satoshi"], "pages": 9}
