Different from many conventional prediction techniques is the need for algorithms to generate a diverse set of plausible questions, which we refer to as creativity. In this paper we propose a creative algorithm for visual question generation which combines the advantages of variational autoencoders with long short-term memory networks. We demonstrate that our framework is able to generate a large set of varying questions given a single input image.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Northwestern University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Unnat Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Unnat", "Ziyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ziyu", "Alexander G.
