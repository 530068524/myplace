When classes are difficult to discriminate, it makes sense to allow k guesses and evaluate classifiers based on the top-k error instead of the standard zero-one loss. We propose top-k multiclass SVM as a direct method to optimize for top-k performance. Our generalization of the well-known multiclass SVM is based on a tight convex upper bound of the top-k error. We propose a fast optimization scheme based on an efficient projection onto the top-k simplex, which is of its own interest. Experiments on five datasets show consistent improvements in top-k accuracy compared to various baselines.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Saarland University", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Maksim Lapin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lapin:Maksim", "Matthias Hein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hein_0001:Matthias", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 9}
