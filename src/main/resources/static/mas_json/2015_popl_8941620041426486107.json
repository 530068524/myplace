{"title": "From Communicating Machines to Graphical Choreographies.", "fields": ["fork", "choreography", "asynchronous communication", "notation", "business process model and notation"], "abstract": "Graphical choreographies, or global graphs, are general multiparty session specifications featuring expressive constructs such as forking, merging, and joining for representing application-level protocols. Global graphs can be directly translated into modelling notations such as BPMN and UML. This paper presents an algorithm whereby a global graph can be constructed from asynchronous interactions represented by communicating finite-state machines (CFSMs). Our results include: a sound and complete characterisation of a subset of safe CFSMs from which global graphs can be constructed; an algorithm to translate CFSMs to global graphs; a time complexity analysis; and an implementation of our theory, as well as an experimental evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "University of Leicester", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Julien Lange.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lange:Julien", "Emilio Tuosto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuosto:Emilio", "Nobuko Yoshida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshida:Nobuko"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
