In fact, to a large extent, it was the clear formulation and elegant deployment of this very principle that helped Rijndael win the AES competition. Moreover, most SHA-3 finalists have come with explicit upper bounds on the EDP of a characteristic as a major part of their design rationale. However, despite the pervasiveness of this design approach, there is no understanding of what such bounds actually mean for the security of a primitive once a key is fixed \u2014 an essential security question in practice.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Technical University of Denmark", "Ruhr University Bochum"], "authors": ["C\u00e9line Blondeau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blondeau:C=eacute=line", "Andrey Bogdanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogdanov:Andrey", "Gregor Leander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leander:Gregor"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 18}
