{"title": "Bounded Regret for Finite-Armed Structured Bandits.", "fields": ["mathematical economics", "bounded function", "mathematical optimization", "expected return", "regret"], "abstract": "We study a new type of K-armed bandit problem where the expected return of one arm may depend on the returns of other arms. We present a new algorithm for this general class of problems and show that under certain circumstances it is possible to achieve finite expected cumulative regret. We also give problem-dependent lower bounds on the cumulative regret showing that at least in special cases the new algorithm is nearly optimal.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tor Lattimore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lattimore:Tor", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "pages": 9}
