Storytelling is an integral part of many modern computer games; within games stories create context, motivate the player, and move the action forward. Interactive Narrative is the use of AI to create and manage stories within games, creating the perception that the player is a character in a dynamically unfolding and responsive story. This paper introduces Game AI and focuses on the open research problems of Interactive Narrative.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mark Riedl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riedl:Mark", "Vadim Bulitko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulitko:Vadim"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
