Bonchi, Sobocinski, and Zanasi [9] have shown that, given a suitable distribution law, a pair of Hopf algebras forms two Frobenius algebras. Here we take the opposite approach, and show that interacting Frobenius algebras form Hopf algebras. We generalise [9] by including non-trivial dynamics of the underlying object---the so-called phase group---and investigate the effects of finite dimensionality of the underlying model, and recover the system of Bonchi et al as a subtheory in the prime power dimensional case. However the more general theory does not arise from a distributive law.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Strathclyde", "University of Strathclyde", "Computer And In ... mation Sciences"], "authors": ["Ross Duncan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duncan:Ross", "Kevin Dunne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunne:Kevin"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
