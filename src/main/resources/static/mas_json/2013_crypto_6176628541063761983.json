In previous LWE-based FHE schemes, multiplication is a complicated and expensive step involving \u201crelinearization\u201d. In this work, we propose a new technique for building FHE schemes that we call the approximate eigenvector method. In our scheme, for the most part, homomorphic addition and multiplication are just matrix addition and multiplication. This makes our scheme both asymptotically faster and (we believe) easier to understand.", "citation": "Citations (589)", "departments": ["IBM", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Craig Gentry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentry:Craig", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit", "Brent Waters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waters:Brent"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 18}
