{"title": "Compiler-instrumented, Dynamic Secret-Redaction of Legacy Processes for Attacker Deception.", "fields": ["dataflow", "annotation", "web server", "redaction", "legacy code"], "abstract": "An enhanced dynamic taint-tracking semantics is presented and implemented, facilitating fast and precise runtime secret redaction from legacy processes, such as those compiled from C/C++. The enhanced semantics reduce the annotation burden imposed upon developers seeking to add secret-redaction capabilities to legacy code, while curtailing over-tainting and label creep.\n\nAn implementation for LLVM's DataFlow Sanitizer automatically instruments taint-tracking and secret-redaction support into annotated C/C++ programs at compile-time, yielding programs that can self-censor their address spaces in response to emerging cyber-attacks. The technology is applied to produce the first information flow-based honey-patching architecture for the Apache web server. Rather than merely blocking intrusions, the modified server deceptively diverts attacker connections to secret-sanitized process clones that monitor attacker activities and disinform adversaries with honey-data.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Frederico Araujo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Araujo:Frederico", "Kevin W.
