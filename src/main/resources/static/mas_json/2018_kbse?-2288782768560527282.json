However, even with such knowledge it is di cult to know how to improve the code. Indeed, little tool support exists to understand the energy consumption pro le of a software system and to eventually (automatically) improve its code.     In this paper we present a tool termed jStanley which automatically nds collections in Java programs that can be replaced by others with a positive impact on the energy consumption as well as on the execution time. In seconds, developers obtain information about energy-eager collection usage. jStanley will further suggest alternative collections to improve the code, making it use less time, energy, or a combination of both. The preliminary evaluation we ran using jStanley shows energy gains between 2% and 17%, and a reduction in execution time between 2% and 13%.
