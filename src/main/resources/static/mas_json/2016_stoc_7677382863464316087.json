These algorithms accelerate Gaussian elimination by sparsifying the nonzero matrix entries created by the elimination process. We use these new algorithms to derive the first nearly linear time algorithms for solving systems of equations in connection Laplacians---a generalization of Laplacian matrices that arise in many problems in image and signal processing. We also prove that every connection Laplacian has a linear sized approximate inverse. This is an LU factorization with a linear number of nonzero entries that is a strong approximation of the original matrix. Using such a factorization one can solve systems of equations in a connection Laplacian in linear time. Such a factorization was unknown even for ordinary graph Laplacians.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Yale University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Yale University", "Yale University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Rasmus Kyng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kyng:Rasmus", "Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "Richard Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Richard", "Sushant Sachdeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sachdeva:Sushant", "Daniel A.
