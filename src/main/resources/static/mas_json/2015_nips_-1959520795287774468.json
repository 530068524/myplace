To this end, we propose a framework for constructing and analyzing multilabel classification metrics which reveals novel results on a parametric form for population optimal classifiers, and additional insight into the role of label correlations. In particular, we show that for multilabel metrics constructed as instance-, micro- and macro-averages, the population optimal classifier can be decomposed into binary classifiers based on the marginal instance-conditional distribution of each label, with a weak association between labels via the threshold. Thus, our analysis extends the state of the art from a few known multilabel classification metrics such as Hamming loss, to a general framework applicable to many of the classification metrics in common use. Based on the population-optimal classifier, we propose a computationally efficient and general-purpose plug-in classification algorithm, and prove its consistency with respect to the metric of interest. Empirical results on synthetic and benchmark datasets are supportive of our theoretical findings.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Oluwasanmi Koyejo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koyejo:Oluwasanmi", "Nagarajan Natarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Natarajan:Nagarajan", "Pradeep Ravikumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravikumar:Pradeep", "Inderjit S.
