This model comes from a suite of benchmarks that were posed as a challenge problem for the hybrid systems community, and to our knowledge, we are reporting its first verification. For this work, we implemented the algorithm reported in [10] in C2E2, to automatically compute local discrepancy (rate of convergence or divergence of trajectories) of the model. We verify the key requirements of the model, specified in signal temporal logic (STL), for a set of driver behaviors.\nOpen image in new window", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Parasara Sridhar Duggirala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duggirala:Parasara_Sridhar", "Chuchu Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Chuchu", "Sayan Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Sayan", "Mahesh Viswanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viswanathan_0001:Mahesh"], "pages": 8}
