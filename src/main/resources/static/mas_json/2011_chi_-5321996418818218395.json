We argue that people experience blocking as confusing, as a motivation for self-censorship online, as a cause of impoverishment of available content and as a real threat of personal persecution. Challenging ideas of blocking as a monolithic, abstract policy, we discuss five strategies with which Internet users navigate blocking: self-censorship, cultivating technical savvy, reliance on social ties to relay blocked content, use of already blocked sites for content production as a form of protection and practiced transparency. We also discuss strategies that forum owners and blogging platform providers employ to deal with and to avoid blocking. We conclude by advocating for more research that acknowledges the complexity of the contexts in which all Internet users contribute to the Internet and social media.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Irina Shklovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shklovski:Irina", "Nalini Kotamraju.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotamraju:Nalini"], "pages": 10}
