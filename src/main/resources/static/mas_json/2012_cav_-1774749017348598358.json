The input to the tool is a model of a hybrid dynamical system and a safety property. The output of the tool is a discrete state transition system and a safety property. The correctness guarantee provided by the tool is that if the output property holds for the output discrete system, then the input property holds for the input hybrid system. The input is in HybridSal input language and the output is in SAL syntax. The SAL model can be verified using the SAL tool suite. This paper describes the HybridSAL relational abstracter --- the algorithms it implements, its input, its strength and weaknesses, and its use for verification using the SAL infinite bounded model checker and k-induction prover.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["SRI International"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ashish Tiwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwari:Ashish"], "pages": 7}
