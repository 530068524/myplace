{"title": "Learning with Augmented Class by Exploiting Unlabeled Data.", "fields": ["semi supervised learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In many real-world applications of learning, the environment is open and changes gradually, which requires the learning system to have the ability of detecting and adapting to the changes. Class-incremental learning (CIL) is an important and practical problem where data from unseen augmented classes are fed, but has not been studied well in the past. In C-IL, the system should beware of predicting instances from augmented classes as a seen class, and thus faces the challenge that no such instances were observed during training stage. In this paper, we tackle the challenge by using unlabeled data, which can be cheaply collected in many real-world applications. We propose the LACU framework as well as the LACU-SVM approach to learn the concept of seen classes while incorporating the structure presented in the unlabeled data, so that the misclassification risks among the seen classes as well as between the augmented and the seen classes are minimized simultaneously. Experiments on diverse datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Qing Da.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Da:Qing", "Yang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Yang", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
