The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to \u00bd everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.", "citation": "Citations (5,052)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "OpenAI", "Princeton University", "Duke University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Deakin University", "Deakin University", "Deakin University", "Deakin University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ian J.
