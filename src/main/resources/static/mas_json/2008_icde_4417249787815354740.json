The Earth mover's distance, introduced in computer vision, is successfully used as a similarity model in a number of small-scale applications. Its computational complexity hindered its adoption in large multimedia databases. We enable directly indexing the Earth mover's distance in structures such as the R-tree and the VA-file by providing the accurate 'MinDist' function to any bounding rectangle in the index. We exploit the computational structure of the new MinDist to derive a new lower bound for the EMD MinDist which is assembled from quantized partial solutions yielding very fast query processing times. We prove completeness of our approach in a multistep scheme. Extensive experiments on real world data demonstrate the high efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Ira Assent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Assent:Ira", "Marc Wichterich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wichterich:Marc", "Tobias Meisen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meisen:Tobias", "Thomas Seidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidl_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
