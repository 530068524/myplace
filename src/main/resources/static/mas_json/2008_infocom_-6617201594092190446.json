Yet, their success depends considerably on their ability to ensure reliable event detection. Such guarantees can be provided only if the target field monitored by a WSN does not contain coverage holes that are not monitored by any sensor. Currently, the coverage-holes detection solutions require accurate knowledge of the sensors locations, which cannot be easily obtained, or they cannot provide guarantees on the coverage quality. In this study we address the challenge of designing an accurate k-coverage verification scheme, without using location information, for a predefined kges1. To this end, we present an efficient, distributed and localized k-coverage verification scheme with proven guarantees on its coverage detection quality. Our simulations show that the scheme accurately detects coverage holes of various sizes.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Yigal Bejerano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bejerano:Yigal"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 5}
