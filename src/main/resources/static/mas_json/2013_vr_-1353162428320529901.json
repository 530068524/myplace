Flexible spaces is an impossible environment that violates the real world constancy in favor of providing the experience of seamless, unrestricted natural walking over a large-scale virtual environment (VE).", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Khrystyna Vasylevska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasylevska:Khrystyna", "Hannes Kaufmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufmann:Hannes", "Mark T.
