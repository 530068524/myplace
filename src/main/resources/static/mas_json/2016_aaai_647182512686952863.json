{"title": "Generalized Emphatic Temporal Difference Learning: Bias-Variance Analysis.", "fields": ["variance reduction", "bounded function", "function approximation", "markov decision process", "temporal difference learning"], "abstract": "We consider the off-policy evaluation problem in Markov decision processes with function approximation. We propose a generalization of the recently introduced emphatic temporal differences (ETD) algorithm (Sutton, Mahmood, and White 2015), which encompasses the original ETD(\u03bb), as well as several other off-policy evaluation algorithms as special cases. We call this framework ETD(\u03bb, \u03b2), where our introduced parameter \u03b2 controls the decay rate of an importance-sampling term. We study conditions under which the projected fixed-point equation underlying ETD(\u03bb, \u03b2) involves a contraction operator, allowing us to present the first asymptotic error bounds (bias) for ETD(\u03bb, \u03b2). Our results show that the original ETD algorithm always involves a contraction operator, and its bias is bounded. Moreover, by controlling \u03b2, our proposed generalization allows trading-off bias for variance reduction, thereby achieving a lower total error.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "Google", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Assaf Hallak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hallak:Assaf", "Aviv Tamar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamar:Aviv", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi", "Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
