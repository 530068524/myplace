Our proposal covers a large range of application problems, with an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently using Concave-Convex Programming. The generality and performance of the approach is demonstrated through three applications including motiffinding, noun-phrase coreference resolution, and optimizing precision at k in information retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (647)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Chun-Nam John Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Chun=Nam_John", "Thorsten Joachims.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joachims:Thorsten"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
