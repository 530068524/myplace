We introduce an efficient and robust solution based on a Bayesian framework using a smooth generalization of the 0-1 loss. A novel bound allows the calculation of very high-dimensional integrals in closed form. It avoids the degeneracy of Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) estimates and leads to an effective noise-adaptive scheme. Moreover, we drastically accelerate our algorithm by using Majorization Minimization (MM) without introducing any approximation or boundary artifacts. We further speed up convergence by turning our algorithm into a neural network termed GradNet, which is highly parallelizable and can be efficiently trained. We demonstrate that our noise-blind formulation can be integrated with different priors and significantly improves existing deblurring algorithms in the noise-blind and in the known-noise case. Furthermore, GradNet leads to state-of-the-art performance across different noise levels, while retaining high computational efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Bern", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Heriot-Watt University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Meiguang Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Meiguang", "Stefan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth_0001:Stefan", "Paolo Favaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Favaro:Paolo"], "pages": 9}
