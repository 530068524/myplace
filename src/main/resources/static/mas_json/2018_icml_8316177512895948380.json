We envision a scenario where learned representations may be handed off to other entities with unknown objectives. We propose and explore adversarial representation learning as a natural method of ensuring those entities will act fairly, and connect group fairness (demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal opportunity) to different adversarial objectives. Through worst-case theoretical guarantees and experimental validation, we show that the choice of this objective is crucial to fair prediction. Furthermore, we present the first in-depth experimental demonstration of fair transfer learning, by showing that our learned representations admit fair predictions on new tasks while maintaining utility, an essential goal of fair representation learning.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Vector Institute"], "authors": ["David Madras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madras:David", "Elliot Creager.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Creager:Elliot", "Toniann Pitassi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitassi:Toniann", "Richard S.
