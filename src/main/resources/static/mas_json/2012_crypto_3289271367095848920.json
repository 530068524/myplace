While in all previous works, the ciphertext noise grows quadratically $$B \\rightarrow B^2\\cdot \\text {poly}n$$ with every multiplication before \"refreshing\", our noise only grows linearly $$B \\rightarrow B\\cdot \\text {poly}n$$.\n\nWe use this technique to construct a scale-invariant fully homomorphic encryption scheme, whose properties only depend on the ratio between the modulus q and the initial noise level B, and not on their absolute values.\n\nOur scheme has a number of advantages over previous candidates: It uses the same modulus throughout the evaluation process no need for \"modulus switching\", and this modulus can take arbitrary form. In addition, security can be classically reduced from the worst-case hardness of the GapSVP problem with quasi-polynomial approximation factor, whereas previous constructions could only exhibit a quantum reduction from GapSVP.", "citation": "Citations (433)", "departments": ["Stanford University"], "authors": ["Zvika Brakerski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brakerski:Zvika"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 19}
