The general goal of   researchers in the field of ECAs is to create agents that can be  more natural, believable and easy to use. In this paper, we are interested in increasing believability of ECAs. Specifically, we are interested in making the intentionality of the agent believable regarding actions and reactions that create the impression of an independent entity with goals and, specially, feelings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"], "authors": ["Michelle Denise Leonhardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonhardt:Michelle_Denise"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
