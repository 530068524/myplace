However, character n-gram has its own limitation and proper addition of new words can increase the ASR performance. Here we propose a discriminative lexicon adaptation approach for improved character accuracy, which not only adds new words but also deletes some words from the current lexicon. Different from other lexicon adaptation approaches, we consider the acoustic features and make our lexicon adaptation criterion consistent with that in the decoding process. The proposed approach not only improves the ASR character accuracy but also significantly enhances the performance of a character-based spoken document retrieval system.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yi-Cheng Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Yi=Cheng", "Lin-Shan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Lin=Shan", "Sadaoki Furui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furui:Sadaoki"], "pages": 9}
