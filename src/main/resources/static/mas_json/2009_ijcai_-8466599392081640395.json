We discuss several desired properties that guarantee that the resulting HTNs will correctly handle the nondeterminism in the domain. We developed a new learning algorithm, called HTN-MAKERND, that exploits these properties. We implemented HTN-MAKERND in the recently-proposed HTN-MAKER system, a goal-regression based HTN learning approach. In our theoretical study, we show that HTN-MAKERND soundly produces HTN planning knowledge in low-order polynomial times, despite the nondeterminism. In our experiments with two nondeterministic planning domains, ND-SHOP2, a well-known HTN planning algorithm for nondeterministic domains, significantly outperformed (in some cases, by about 3 orders of magnitude) the well-known planner MBP using the learned HTNs.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Lehigh University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Lehigh University"], "authors": ["Chad Hogg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hogg:Chad", "Ugur Kuter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuter:Ugur", "H\u00e9ctor Mu\u00f1oz-Avila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mu=ntilde=oz=Avila:H=eacute=ctor"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
