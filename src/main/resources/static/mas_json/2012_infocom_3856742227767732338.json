{"title": "FemtoCaching: Wireless video content delivery through distributed caching helpers.", "fields": ["macro", "backhaul", "cache", "base station", "mobile device"], "abstract": "We suggest a novel approach to handle the ongoing explosive increase in the demand for video content in wireless/mobile devices. We envision femtocell-like base stations, which we call helpers, with weak backhaul links but large storage capacity. These helpers form a wireless distributed caching network that assists the macro base station by handling requests of popular files that have been cached. Due to the short distances between helpers and requesting devices, the transmission of cached files can be done very efficiently.", "citation": "Citations (680)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Negin Golrezaei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golrezaei:Negin", "Karthikeyan Shanmugam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shanmugam:Karthikeyan", "Alexandros G.
