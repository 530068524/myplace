{"title": "Result selection and summarization for Web Table search.", "fields": ["automatic summarization", "web modeling", "multi document summarization", "web search query", "web mapping"], "abstract": "The amount of information available on the Web has been growing dramatically, raising the importance of techniques for searching the Web. Recently, Web Tables emerged as a model, which enables users to search for information in a structured way. However, effective presentation of results for Web Table search requires (1) selecting a ranking of tables that acknowledges the diversity within the search result; and (2) summarizing the information content of the selected tables concisely but meaningful. In this paper, we formalize these requirements as the diversified table selection problem and the structured table summarization problem. We show that both problems are computationally intractable and, thus, present heuristic algorithms to solve them. For these algorithms, we prove salient performance guarantees, such as near-optimality, stability, and fairness. Our experiments with real-world collections of thousands of Web Tables highlight the scalability of our techniques. We achieve improvements up to 50% in diversity and 10% in relevance over baselines for Web Table selection, and reduce the information loss induced by table summarization by up to 50%. In a user study, we observed that our techniques are preferred over alternative solutions.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Imperial College London", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Nguyen Thanh Tam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tam:Nguyen_Thanh", "Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hung:Nguyen_Quoc_Viet", "Matthias Weidlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weidlich:Matthias", "Karl Aberer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aberer:Karl"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
