{"title": "Learning Populations of Parameters.", "fields": ["random variable", "machine learning", "histogram", "cumulative distribution function", "earth mover s distance"], "abstract": "Consider the following estimation problem: there are $n$ entities, each with an unknown parameter $p_i \\in [0,1]$, and we observe $n$ independent random variables, $X_1,\\ldots,X_n$, with $X_i \\sim $ Binomial$(t, p_i)$. How accurately can one recover the ``histogram'' (i.e. cumulative density function) of the $p_i$'s? While the empirical estimates would recover the histogram to earth mover distance $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}})$ (equivalently, $\\ell_1$ distance between the CDFs), we show that, provided $n$ is sufficiently large, we can achieve error $O(\\frac{1}{t})$ which is information theoretically optimal. We also extend our results to the multi-dimensional parameter case, capturing settings where each member of the population has multiple associated parameters. Beyond the theoretical results, we demonstrate that the recovery algorithm performs well in practice on a variety of datasets, providing illuminating insights into several domains, including politics, sports analytics, and variation in the gender ratio of offspring.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kevin Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Kevin", "Weihao Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Weihao", "Gregory Valiant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valiant:Gregory"], "pages": 10}
