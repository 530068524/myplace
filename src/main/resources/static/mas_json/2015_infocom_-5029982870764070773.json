The increasing needs of PHR monitoring require the involvement of healthcare companies that provide monitoring programs for analyzing PHRs. Unfortunately, healthcare companies are lack of the computation, storage, and communication capability on supporting millions of patients. To tackle this problem, they seek for the help from the cloud. However, delegating monitoring programs to the cloud may incur serious security and privacy breaches because people have to provide their identity information and PHRs to the public domain. Even worse, the cloud may mistakenly return the incorrect computation results, which will put patients' life in jeopardy. In this paper, we propose a verifiable privacy-preserving monitoring scheme for cloud-assisted mHealth systems. Our scheme allows patients to verify the correctness of computation results from the cloud without revealing their PHRs and identity information. In addition, our advanced schemes offer efficient PHR updates and PHR computations on complex monitoring programs. By detailed performance evaluation, we have shown the security and efficiency of our proposed scheme.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Binghamton University", "University of Florida", "University of Nevada, Reno", "Mississippi State University"], "authors": ["Linke Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Linke", "Yuguang Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Yuguang", "Ming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0006:Ming", "Pan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Pan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
