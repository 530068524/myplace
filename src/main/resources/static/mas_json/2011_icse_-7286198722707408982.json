{"title": "MeCC: memory comparison-based clone detector.", "fields": ["abstract interpretation", "clone", "software maintenance", "code refactoring", "software evolution"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new semantic clone detection technique by comparing programs' abstract memory states, which are computed by a semantic-based static analyzer.   Our experimental study using three large-scale open source projects shows that our technique can detect semantic clones that existing syntactic- or semantic-based clone detectors miss. Our technique can help developers identify inconsistent clone changes, find refactoring candidates, and understand software evolution related to semantic clones.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Heejung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Heejung", "Yungbum Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Yungbum", "Sunghun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Sunghun", "Kwangkeun Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Kwangkeun"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
