{"title": "DRN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for News Recommendation.", "fields": ["data mining", "click through rate", "development environment", "reinforcement learning", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for news recommendation. Online personalized news recommendation is a highly challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of news features and user preferences. Although some online recommendation models have been proposed to address the dynamic nature of news recommendation, these methods have three major issues. First, they only try to model current reward (e.g., Click Through Rate). Second, very few work consider to use user feedback other than click / no click labels (e.g., how frequent user returns) to help improve recommendation. Third, these methods tend to keep recommending similar news to users, which may cause users to get bored. Therefore, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Deep Q-Learning based recommendation framework, which can model future reward explicitly. We further consider user return pattern as a supplement to click / no click label in order to capture more user feedback information. In addition, an effective exploration strategy is incorporated to find new attractive news for users. Extensive experiments are conducted on the offline dataset and online production environment of Chinese Bing News and have shown the superior performance of our methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Guanjie Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Guanjie", "Fuzheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Fuzheng", "Zihan Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Zihan", "Yang Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Yang", "Nicholas Jing Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Nicholas_Jing", "Xing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Xing", "Zhenhui Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhenhui"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
