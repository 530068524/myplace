{"title": "Quotient RDF Summaries Based on Type Hierarchies.", "fields": ["grasp", "rdf", "automatic summarization", "novelty", "quotient"], "abstract": "Summarization has been applied to RDF graphs to obtain a compact representation thereof, easier to grasp by human users. We present a new brand of quotient-based RDF graph summaries, whose main novelty is to summarize together RDF nodes belonging to the same type hierarchy. We argue that such summaries bring more useful information to users about the structure and semantics of an RDF graph.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Pawel Guzewicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guzewicz:Pawel", "Ioana Manolescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manolescu:Ioana"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
