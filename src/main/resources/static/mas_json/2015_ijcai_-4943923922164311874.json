Intuitively, we want to tune hyper-parameters on small sub-matrix sample and then exploit them into the original large-scale matrix. However, most of existing MF methods are scale-variant, which means the optimal hyperparameters usually change with the different scale of matrices. To this end, in this paper we propose a scale-invariant parametric MF method, where a set of scale-invariant parameters is defined for model complexity regularization. Therefore, the proposed method can free us from tuning hyperparameters on large-scale matrix, and achieve a good performance in a more efficient way. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset clearly validate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Baidu", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Guangxiang Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Guangxiang", "Hengshu Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Hengshu", "Qi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Qi", "Ping Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0001:Ping", "Enhong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Enhong", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
