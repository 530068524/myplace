We perform a largescale empirical evaluation of our obtained system, which demonstrates that we significantly beat a realistic tree-to-tree baseline on the WMT 2009 English! German translation task. As an additional contribution we make the developed software and complete tool-chain publicly available for further experimentation.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Fabienne Braune.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braune:Fabienne", "Nina Seemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seemann:Nina", "Daniel Quernheim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quernheim:Daniel", "Andreas Maletti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maletti:Andreas"], "pages": 11}
