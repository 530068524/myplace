{"title": "A Bayesian Mixed Effects Model of Literary Character.", "fields": ["bayesian probability", "machine learning", "mixed model", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of automatically inferring latent character types in a collection of 15,099 English novels published between 1700 and 1899. Unlike prior work in which character types are assumed responsible for probabilistically generating all text associated with a character, we introduce a model that employs multiple effects to account for the influence of extra-linguistic information (such as author). In an empirical evaluation, we find that this method leads to improved agreement with the preregistered judgments of a literary scholar, complementing the results of alternative models.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "School of Information Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["David Bamman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bamman:David", "Ted Underwood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Underwood:Ted", "Noah A.
