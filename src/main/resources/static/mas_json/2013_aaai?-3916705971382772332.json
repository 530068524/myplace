{"title": "Subchloroplast Location Prediction via Homolog Knowledge Transfer and Feature Selection.", "fields": ["homology", "data transformation", "machine learning", "feature selection", "knowledge transfer"], "abstract": "The accuracy of subchloroplast location prediction algorithms often depends on predictive and succinct features derived from proteins. Thus, to improve the prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a novel SubChloroplast location prediction method, called SCHOTS, which integrates the HOmolog knowledge Transfer and feature Selection methods. SCHOTS contains two stages. First, discriminating features are generated by WS-LCHI, a Weighted Gene Ontology (GO) transfer model based on bit-Score of proteins and Logarithmic transformation of CHIsquare. Second, the more informative GO terms are selected from the features. Extensive studies conducted on three real datasets demonstrate that SCHOTS outperforms three off-the-shelf subchloroplast prediction methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hefei University of Technology", "University of Vermont", "Hefei University of Technology", "Hefei University of Technology"], "authors": ["Xiaomei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiaomei", "Xindong Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xindong", "Gong-Qing Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Gong=Qing", "Xuegang Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Xuegang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
