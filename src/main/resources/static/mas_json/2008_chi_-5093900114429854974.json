In this paper we put multi-flick to test, by designing several flick-based scrolling techniques. We first map out the de-sign space of multi-flick and identify mapping functions that make multi-flick a natural and intuitive technique for document navigation. In the first experiment we compare several multi-flick variations for navigating lists on three different devices -- a PDA, a tabletPC, and a large table. Our study shows that compound-multi-flick (CMF) is the most preferred technique and it is at least as fast, if not faster than the traditional scrollbar. In a follow-up experiment, we evaluate multi-flick for scrolling text-based documents. Results show that all implementations of multi-flick are as good as the scrollbar for short distances while CMF is the most preferred. We discuss the implications of our findings and present several design guidelines.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Philips", "University of Manitoba", "University of Bristol", "Eindhoven Unive ... en, Netherlands"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dzmitry Aliakseyeu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aliakseyeu:Dzmitry", "Pourang Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Pourang", "Andr\u00e9s Lucero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucero:Andr=eacute=s", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram"], "pages": 10}
