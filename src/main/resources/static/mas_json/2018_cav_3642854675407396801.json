{"title": "Deciding Probabilistic Bisimilarity Distance One for Labelled Markov Chains.", "fields": ["equivalence relation", "equivalence", "probabilistic logic", "markov chain", "if and only if"], "abstract": "Probabilistic bisimilarity is an equivalence relation that captures which states of a labelled Markov chain behave the same. Since this behavioural equivalence only identifies states that transition to states that behave exactly the same with exactly the same probability, this notion of equivalence is not robust. Probabilistic bisimilarity distances provide a quantitative generalization of probabilistic bisimilarity. The distance of states captures the similarity of their behaviour. The smaller the distance, the more alike the states behave. In particular, states are probabilistic bisimilar if and only if their distance is zero. This quantitative notion is robust in that small changes in the transition probabilities result in small changes in the distances.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["York University", "York University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Qiyi Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Qiyi", "Franck van Breugel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Breugel:Franck_van"], "pages": 19}
