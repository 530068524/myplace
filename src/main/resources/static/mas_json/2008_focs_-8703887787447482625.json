{"title": "Isomorhism of Hypergraphs of Low Rank in Moderately Exponential Time.", "fields": ["bounded function", "hypergraph", "graph isomorphism", "rank", "constraint graph"], "abstract": "We give an algorithm to decide isomorphism of hypergraphs of rank k in time exp (Otilde(k 2 radicn)), where n is the number of vertices. (The rank is the maximum size of edges; the tilde refers to a polylogarithmic factor.) The case of bounded k answers a 24-year-old question and removes an obstacle to improving the worst case-bound for Graph Isomorphism testing. The best previously known bound, even for k = 3, was C n  (Luks 1999).", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babai:L=aacute=szl=oacute=", "Paolo Codenotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Codenotti:Paolo"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
