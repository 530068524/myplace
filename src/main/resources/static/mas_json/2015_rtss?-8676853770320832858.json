It is known that this problem is strongly coNP-complete in the general case, but also that there exists a pseudo-polynomial time solution for instances with utilization bounded from above by any constant c, where 0", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Uppsala University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Pontus Ekberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ekberg:Pontus", "Wang Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi_0001:Wang"], "pages": 9}
