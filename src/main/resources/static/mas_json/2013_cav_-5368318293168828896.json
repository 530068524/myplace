Subsequently, Esparza, Kiefer, and Luttenberger [7] obtained upper bounds on the convergence rate of Newton's method for certain classes of MPSs. More recently, better upper bounds have been obtained for special classes of MPSs ([10, 9]).\n\nHowever, prior to this paper, for arbitrary (not necessarily strongly-connected) MPSs, no upper bounds at all were known on the convergence rate of Newton's method as a function of the encoding size |P| of the input MPS, x=P(x).\n\nIn this paper we provide worst-case upper bounds, as a function of both the input encoding size |P|, and e>0, on the number of iterations required for decomposed Newton's method (even with rounding) to converge to within additive error e>0 of q*, for an arbitrary MPS with LFP solution q*. Our upper bounds are essentially optimal in terms of several important parameters of the problem.\n\nUsing our upper bounds, and building on prior work, we obtain the first P-time algorithm (in the standard Turing model of computation) for quantitative model checking, to within arbitrary desired precision, of discrete-time QBDs and (equivalently) probabilistic 1-counter automata, with respect to any (fixed) \u03c9-regular or LTL property.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "Columbia University", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "Columbia University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Alistair Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart:Alistair", "Kousha Etessami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etessami:Kousha", "Mihalis Yannakakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yannakakis:Mihalis"], "pages": 16}
