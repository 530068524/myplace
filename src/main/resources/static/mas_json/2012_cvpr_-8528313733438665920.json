In this work, we exploit the linearity of the Schrodinger equation to (i) design fast discrete convolution methods using the FFT to compute the distance transform, (ii) derive the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) via the squared magnitude of the Fourier transform of the wave function, (iii) extend the Schrodinger formalism to cover the case of curves parametrized as line segments as opposed to point-sets, (iv) demonstrate that the Schrodinger formalism permits the addition of wave functions \u2014 an operation that is not allowed for distance transforms, and finally (v) construct a fundamentally new Schrodinger equation and show that it can represent both the distance transform and its gradient density \u2014 not possible in earlier efforts.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Manu Sethi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sethi:Manu", "Anand Rangarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangarajan_0001:Anand", "Karthik S.
