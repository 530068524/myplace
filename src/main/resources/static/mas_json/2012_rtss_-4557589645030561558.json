It is well known that such resource sharing leads to complex timing behavior that degrades the quality of control, and more importantly, can jeopardize stability in the worst-case, if not properly taken into account during design. Although stability of the control applications is absolutely essential, a design flow driven by the worst-case scenario often leads to poor control quality due to the significant amount of pessimism involved and the fact that the worst-case scenario occurs very rarely. On the other hand, designing the system merely based on control quality, determined by the expected (average-case) behavior, does not guarantee the stability of control applications in the worst-case. Therefore, both control quality and worst-case stability have to be considered during the design process, i.e., period assignment, task scheduling, and control-synthesis. In this paper, we present an integrated approach for designing high-quality embedded control systems, while guaranteeing their stability.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Link\u00f6ping University", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Lund University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Amir Aminifar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aminifar:Amir", "Soheil Samii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samii:Soheil", "Petru Eles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eles:Petru", "Zebo Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Zebo", "Anton Cervin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cervin:Anton"], "pages": 10}
