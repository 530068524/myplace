{"title": "Exploring Opportunistic Execution for Integrating Security into Legacy Hard Real-Time Systems.", "fields": ["proprietary hardware", "predictability", "compromise", "geometric programming", "legacy system"], "abstract": "Due to physical isolation as well as use of proprietary hardware and protocols, traditional real-time systems (RTS) were considered to be invulnerable to security breaches and external attacks. This assumption is being challenged by recent attacks that highlight vulnerabilities in RTS. Besides, a straightforward integration of security mechanisms might compromise the safety and predictability guarantees of such systems. In this paper, we focus on integrating security mechanisms into RTS (especially legacy RTS) and define a metric to measure the effectiveness of such integration. We combine opportunistic execution with hierarchical scheduling to maintain compatibility with legacy systems while still providing flexibility. The proposed approach is shown to increase the security posture of RTS without impacting their temporal (and hence, safety) constraints.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Oregon State University", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Monowar Hasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasan:Monowar", "Sibin Mohan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohan:Sibin", "Rakesh B.
