As web applications adopt input sanitization routines to prevent web security risks, static code attributes that represent the characteristics of these routines may be useful for predicting web application vulnerabilities. In this paper, we classify various input sanitization methods into different types and propose a set of static code attributes that represent these types. Then we use data mining methods to predict SQL injection and cross site scripting vulnerabilities in web applications. Preliminary experiments show that our proposed attributes are important indicators of such vulnerabilities.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Lwin Khin Shar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shar:Lwin_Khin", "Hee Beng Kuan Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Hee_Beng_Kuan"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
