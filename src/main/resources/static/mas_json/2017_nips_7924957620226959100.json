Despite the recent introduction of several algorithms with good empirical performance, it is unknown whether general optimal transport distances can be approximated in near-linear time. This paper demonstrates that this ambitious goal is in fact achieved by Cuturi's Sinkhorn Distances. This result relies on a new analysis of Sinkhorn iterations, which also directly suggests a new greedy coordinate descent algorithm Greenkhorn with the same theoretical guarantees. Numerical simulations illustrate that Greenkhorn significantly outperforms the classical Sinkhorn algorithm in practice.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jason Altschuler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altschuler:Jason", "Jonathan Weed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weed:Jonathan", "Philippe Rigollet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rigollet:Philippe"], "pages": 11}
