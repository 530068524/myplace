{"title": "Correcting Errors in RSA Private Keys.", "fields": ["binary logarithm", "randomized algorithm", "factorization", "cold boot attack", "public key cryptography"], "abstract": "Let pk = (N, e) be an RSA public key with corresponding secret key sk = (p, q, d, dp, dq, qp-1). Assume that we obtain partial error-free information of sk, e.g., assume that we obtain half of the most significant bits of p. Then there are well-known algorithms to recover the full secret key. As opposed to these algorithms that allow for correcting erasures of the key sk, we present for the first time a heuristic probabilistic algorithm that is capable of correcting errors in sk provided that e is small. That is, on input of a full but error-prone secret key sk we reconstruct the original sk by correcting the faults.\n\nMore precisely, consider an error rate of \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1/2), where we flip each bit in sk with probability \u03b4 resulting in an erroneous key sk. Our Las-Vegas type algorithm allows to recover sk from sk in expected time polynomial in log N with success probability close to 1, provided that \u03b4 < 0.237. We also obtain a polynomial time Las-Vegas factorization algorithm for recovering the factorization (p, q) from an erroneous version with error rate \u03b4 < 0.084.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum"], "authors": ["Wilko Henecka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henecka:Wilko", "Alexander May.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/May_0001:Alexander", "Alexander Meurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meurer:Alexander"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2010", "pages": 19}
