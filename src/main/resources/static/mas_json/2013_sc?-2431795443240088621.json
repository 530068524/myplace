{"title": "Exploring power behaviors and trade-offs of in-situ data analytics.", "fields": ["data exchange", "data analysis", "overhead", "workflow", "supercomputer"], "abstract": "As scientific applications target exascale, challenges related to data and energy are becoming dominating concerns. For example, coupled simulation workflows are increasingly adopting in-situ data processing and analysis techniques to address costs and overheads due to data movement and I/O. However it is also critical to understand these overheads and associated trade-offs from an energy perspective. The goal of this paper is exploring data-related energy/performance trade-offs for end-to-end simulation workflows running at scale on current high-end computing systems. Specifically, this paper presents: (1) an analysis of the data-related behaviors of a combustion simulation workflow with an in-situ data analytics pipeline, running on the Titan system at ORNL; (2) a power model based on system power and data exchange patterns, which is empirically validated; and (3) the use of the model to characterize the energy behavior of the workflow and to explore energy/performance trade-offs on current as well as emerging systems.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Sandia National Laboratories", "Sandia National Laboratories"], "authors": ["Marc Gamell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gamell:Marc", "Ivan Rodero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodero:Ivan", "Manish Parashar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parashar:Manish", "Janine Bennett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bennett:Janine", "Hemanth Kolla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolla:Hemanth", "Jacqueline Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jacqueline", "Peer-Timo Bremer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bremer:Peer=Timo", "Aaditya G.
