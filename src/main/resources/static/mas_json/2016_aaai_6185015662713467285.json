Our model unifies prior efforts in discourse-level modeling with that of Fill-more's related notion of frame, as captured in sentence-level, FrameNet semantic parses; as part of this, we resurrect the coupling among Minsky's frames, Schank's scripts and Fill-more's frames, as originally laid out by those authors. Empirically, our approach yields improved scenario representations, reflected quantitatively in lower surprisal and more coherent latent scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "authors": ["Francis Ferraro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferraro:Francis", "Benjamin Van Durme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durme:Benjamin_Van"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
