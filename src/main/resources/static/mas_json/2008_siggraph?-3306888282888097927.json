The overall goal of our project is to increase the interactivity of tabletop tangible interfaces. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel tabletop tangible interface named \u2018ForceTile.\u2019 This interface can detect the force distribution on its surface as well as its position, rotation and ID by using a vision-based approach. In our previous optical force sensors \u201cGelForce\u201d [Kamiyama et al. 2004], an elastic body and cameras are fixed together. Contrarily, on this system, users can place and move multiple tile-shaped interfaces on the tabletop display freely. Furthermore, users can interact with projected images on the tabletop screen by moving, pushing or pinching the ForceTiles.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Japan Science a ... chnology Agency"], "authors": ["Yasuaki Kakehi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kakehi:Yasuaki", "Kensei Jo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jo:Kensei", "Katsunori Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Katsunori", "Kouta Minamizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minamizawa:Kouta", "Hideaki Nii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nii:Hideaki", "Naoki Kawakami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawakami:Naoki", "Takeshi Naemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naemura:Takeshi", "Susumu Tachi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tachi:Susumu"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2008", "pages": 1}
