Aim: To examine the outcomes available from the use of Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE) practices, so as to identify where these can provide support for, and inform, teaching activities. Method: We have examined all known secondary studies published up to the end of 2009, together with those published in major journals to mid-2011, and identified where these provide practical results that are relevant to student needs. Results: Starting with 145 candidate systematic literature reviews (SLRs), we were able to identify and classify potentially useful teaching material from 43 of them. Conclusions: EBSE can potentially lend authority to our teaching, although the coverage of key topics is uneven. Additionally, mapping studies can provide support for research-led teaching.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Durham University", "Durham University", "Keele University", "Keele University"], "authors": ["David Budgen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Budgen:David", "Sarah Drummond.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drummond:Sarah", "Pearl Brereton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brereton:Pearl", "Nikki Holland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holland:Nikki"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
