As visually similar pixels are indistinguishable from local context, we alleviate such ambiguity by introducing a global scene constraint. We estimate the global potential in a non-parametric framework. Furthermore, a large margin based CNN metric learning method is proposed for better global potential estimation. The final pixel class prediction is performed by integrating local and global beliefs. Even without any post-processing, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on SiftFlow and competitive results on Stanford Background benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Bing Shuai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shuai:Bing", "Gang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0012:Gang", "Zhen Zuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuo:Zhen", "Bing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Bing", "Lifan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Lifan"], "pages": 10}
