Bounding the treewidth of a Bayesian network greatly reduces the complexity of inferences. Yet, being a global property of the graph, it considerably increases the difficulty of the learning process. Our novel algorithm accomplishes this task, scaling both to large domains and to large treewidths. Our novel approach consistently outperforms the state of the art on experiments with up to thousands of variables.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "School of Elect ... omputer Science", "Dalle Molle Ins ... al Intelligence"], "authors": ["Mauro Scanagatta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scanagatta:Mauro", "Giorgio Corani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corani:Giorgio", "Cassio Polpo de Campos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Campos:Cassio_Polpo_de", "Marco Zaffalon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaffalon:Marco"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
