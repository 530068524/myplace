Many real-world applications such as location-aware word-of-mouth marketing have location-aware requirement. In this paper we study the location-aware influence maximization problem. One big challenge in location-aware influence maximization is to develop an efficient scheme that offers wide influence spread. To address this challenge, we propose two greedy algorithms with 1-1/ e  approximation ratio. To meet the instant-speed requirement, we propose two efficient algorithms with e\u00b7 (1-1/ e ) approximation ratio for any e \u2208 (0,1]. Experimental results on real datasets show our method achieves high performance while keeping large influence spread and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "NUS, Singapore, Singapore", "SAP, Shanghai, China"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Guoliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Guoliang", "Shuo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shuo", "Jianhua Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jianhua", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee", "Wen-Syan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wen=Syan"], "pages": 12}
