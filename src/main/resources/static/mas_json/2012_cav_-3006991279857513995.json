It is based on symbolic execution (se) and its unique features are in how it makes se finite in presence of unbounded loops and its use of interpolants from infeasible paths to tackle the path-explosion problem.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "University of Melbourne", "University of Sydney"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Joxan Jaffar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaffar:Joxan", "Vijayaraghavan Murali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murali:Vijayaraghavan", "Jorge A.
