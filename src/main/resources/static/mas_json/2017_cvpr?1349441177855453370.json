Recent research shows that the aging features deeply learned from large-scale data lead to significant performance improvement on facial image-based age estimation. However, age-related ordinal information is totally ignored in these approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based framework, ranking-CNN, for age estimation. Ranking-CNN contains a series of basic CNNs, each of which is trained with ordinal age labels. Then, their binary outputs are aggregated for the final age prediction. We theoretically obtain a much tighter error bound for ranking-based age estimation. Moreover, we rigorously prove that ranking-CNN is more likely to get smaller estimation errors when compared with multi-class classification approaches. Through extensive experiments, we show that statistically, ranking-CNN significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art age estimation models on benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Wayne State University", "Wayne State University", "Wayne State University", "Ford Motor Company", "Ford Motor Company"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shixing Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shixing", "Caojin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Caojin", "Ming Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Ming", "Jialiang Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Jialiang", "Mike Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Mike"], "pages": 10}
