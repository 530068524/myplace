Current automatic test case generation techniques implement explorative approaches that, although producing useful test cases, have a limited capability of covering semantically relevant interactions, thus frequently missing important testing scenarios. These techniques typically interact with the available widgets following the structure of the GUI, without any guess about the functions that are executed.   In this paper we propose Augusto, a test case generation technique that exploits a built-in knowledge of the semantics associated with popular and well-known functionalities, such as CRUD operations, to automatically generate effective test cases with automated functional oracles. Empirical results indicate that Augusto can reveal faults that cannot be revealed with state of the art techniques.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Leonardo Mariani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mariani:Leonardo", "Mauro Pezz\u00e8.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pezz=egrave=:Mauro", "Daniele Zuddas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuddas:Daniele"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
