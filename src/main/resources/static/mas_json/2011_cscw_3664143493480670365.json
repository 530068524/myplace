This paper proposes an automatic method to adjust the virtual teacher's orientation according to a given task motion. Through always showing the physical task's critical features regardless of changes in position, mimicking errors regarding the respective task are expected to be minimized. Thus this research is considered to advance transferring skills of physical tasks. It can also be applied to remote collaborative work.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba"], "authors": ["Mamoun Nawahdah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nawahdah:Mamoun", "Tomoo Inoue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inoue:Tomoo"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
