Examples of this problem include exemplar-based clustering and nonparametric inference such as Gaussian process regression on massive data sets. We show that these problems require maximization of a submodular function that captures the informativeness of a set of exemplars, over a data stream. We develop an efficient algorithm, Stream-Greedy, which is guaranteed to obtain a constant fraction of the value achieved by the optimal solution to this NP-hard optimization problem. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on large real-world data sets.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ryan Gomes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gomes:Ryan", "Andreas Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause_0001:Andreas"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
