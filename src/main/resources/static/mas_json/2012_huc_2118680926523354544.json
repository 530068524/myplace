However, the advent of services like eBay has massively increased its prominence. In this paper we describe a novel Internet of Things-based approach to enhancing the second-hand retail experience by augmenting items with their provenance. After a discussion of the underlying technology, we shall describe its deployment in two related case studies conducted in collaboration with Oxfam charity retail outlets in which we tagged donated items with RFID and QR codes, allowing shoppers to hear the story behind the donated items. Finally, we discuss the impact of the deployments and their implications for the second-hand retail sector.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University of Dundee", "Brunel University London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Martin de Jode.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jode:Martin_de", "Ralph Barthel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthel:Ralph", "Jon Rogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogers:Jon", "Angelina Karpovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karpovich:Angelina", "Andrew Hudson-Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hudson=Smith:Andrew", "Michael Quigley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quigley:Michael", "Chris Speed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Speed:Chris"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
