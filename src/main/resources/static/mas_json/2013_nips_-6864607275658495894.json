{"title": "Multiclass Total Variation Clustering.", "fields": ["correlation clustering", "recursion", "non negative matrix factorization", "constrained clustering", "fuzzy clustering"], "abstract": "Ideas from the image processing literature have recently motivated a new set of clustering algorithms that rely on the concept of total variation. While these algorithms perform well for bi-partitioning tasks, their recursive extensions yield unimpressive results for multiclass clustering tasks. This paper presents a general framework for multiclass total variation clustering that does not rely on recursion. The results greatly outperform previous total variation algorithms and compare well with state-of-the-art NMF approaches.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["University of Lausanne", "Loyola Marymount University", "University of San Francisco", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Xavier Bresson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bresson:Xavier", "Thomas Laurent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laurent_0001:Thomas", "David Uminsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uminsky:David", "James H. von Brecht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brecht:James_H=_von"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
