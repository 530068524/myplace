In this paper we present a novel approach to using natural language context for one-shot learning of visual objects, where the robot is immediately able to recognize the described object. We describe the architectural components and demonstrate the proposed approach on a robotic platform in a proof-of-concept evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Tufts University", "Tufts University", "Tufts University", "Inst. for Autom ... ienna, Austria"], "authors": ["Evan A.
