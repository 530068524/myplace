{"title": "The Geography of Pok\u00e9mon GO: Beneficial and Problematic Effects on Places and Movement.", "fields": ["computer science", "popularity", "multimedia", "augmented reality", "geography"], "abstract": "The widespread popularity of Pokemon GO presents the first opportunity to observe the geographic effects of location-based gaming at scale. This paper reports the results of a mixed methods study of the geography of Pokemon GO that includes a five-country field survey of 375 Pokemon GO players and a large scale geostatistical analysis of game elements. Focusing on the key geographic themes of places and movement, we find that the design of Pokemon GO reinforces existing geographically-linked biases (e.g. the game advantages urban areas and neighborhoods with smaller minority populations), that Pokemon GO may have instigated a relatively rare large-scale shift in global human mobility patterns, and that Pokemon GO has geographically-linked safety risks, but not those typically emphasized by the media. Our results point to geographic design implications for future systems in this space such as a means through which the geographic biases present in Pokemon GO may be counteracted.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Lapland", "University of Minnesota", "Northwestern University", "Saarland University", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ashley Colley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colley:Ashley", "Jacob Thebault-Spieker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thebault=Spieker:Jacob", "Allen Yilun Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Allen_Yilun", "Donald Degraen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Degraen:Donald", "Benjamin Fischman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischman:Benjamin", "Jonna H\u00e4kkil\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=kkil=auml=:Jonna", "Kate Kuehl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuehl:Kate", "Valentina Nisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nisi:Valentina", "Nuno Jardim Nunes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nunes:Nuno_Jardim", "Nina Wenig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wenig:Nina", "Dirk Wenig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wenig:Dirk", "Brent J.
