{"title": "Generating Natural-Language Video Descriptions Using Text-Mined Knowledge.", "fields": ["text corpus", "text mining", "annotation", "selection algorithm", "natural language"], "abstract": "We present a holistic data-driven technique that generates natural-language descriptions for videos. We combine the output of state-of-the-art object and activity detectors with \"real-world\" knowledge to select the most probable subject-verb-object triplet for describing a video. We show that this knowledge, automatically mined from web-scale text corpora, enhances the triplet selection algorithm by providing it contextual information and leads to a four-fold increase in activity identification. Unlike previous methods, our approach can annotate arbitrary videos without requiring the expensive collection and annotation of a similar training video corpus. We evaluate our technique against a baseline that does not use text-mined knowledge and show that humans prefer our descriptions 61% of the time.", "citation": "Citations (129)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Massachusetts Lowell", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Niveda Krishnamoorthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamoorthy:Niveda", "Girish Malkarnenkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malkarnenkar:Girish", "Raymond J.
