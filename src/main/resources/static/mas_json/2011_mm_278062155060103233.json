Due to the lack of sufficient labeled video shots, effective shot tagging remains challenging. By observing that video-level tags are more widely provided, we design a novel approach to propagate video-level tags to the test shots. A weighted sparse group lasso method (WSGL) is proposed for shot reconstruction, which well preserves the structural sparsity to reduce the noise in tag propagation. Meanwhile, it simultaneously considers the spatial-temporal information within the video corpus to enhance the tagging performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public video datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland"], "authors": ["Xiaofeng Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaofeng", "Zi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zi", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
