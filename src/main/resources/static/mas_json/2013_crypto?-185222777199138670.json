{"title": "The Mix-and-Cut Shuffle: Small-Domain Encryption Secure against N Queries.", "fields": ["cipher", "multiple encryption", "filesystem level encryption", "56 bit encryption", "40 bit encryption"], "abstract": "We provide a new shuffling algorithm, called Mix-and-Cut, that provides a provably-secure block cipher even for adversaries that can observe the encryption of all N = 2 n domain points. Such fully secure ciphers are useful for format-preserving encryption, where small domains (e.g., n = 30) are common and databases may well include examples of almost all ciphertexts. Mix-and-Cut derives from a general framework for building fully secure pseudorandom permutations (PRPs) from fully secure pseudorandom separators (PRSs). The latter is a new primitive that we treat for the first time. Our framework was inspired by, and uses ideas from, a particular cipher due to Granboulin and Pornin. To achieve full security for Mix-and-Cut using this framework, we give a simple proof that a PRP secure for (1 \u2212 e)N queries (recently achieved efficiently by Hoang, Morris, and Rogaway\u2019s Swap-or-Not cipher) yields a PRS secure for N queries.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of St. Thomas"], "authors": ["Thomas Ristenpart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ristenpart:Thomas", "Scott Yilek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yilek:Scott"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 18}
