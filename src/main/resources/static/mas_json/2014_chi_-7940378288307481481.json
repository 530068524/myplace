We present a framework for synthesizing literatures called the Interdisciplinary Literacy Framework and use it to highlight gaps in our understanding of information literacy that HCI as a field is particularly well suited to fill. We report on two studies that lay a foundation for developing guidelines for assessable information system design. The first is a study of Wikipedians', librarians', and laypersons' information assessment practices from which we derive two important features of assessable designs: information provenance and stewardship. The second is an experimental study in which we operationalize these concepts in designs and test them using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Andrea Forte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forte:Andrea", "Nazanin Andalibi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andalibi:Nazanin", "Thomas H.
