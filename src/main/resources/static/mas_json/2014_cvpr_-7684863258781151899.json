Similarly, visual recognition deployments should be robust to varying computational budgets. Such situations require Anytime recognition ability, which is rarely considered in computer vision research. We present a method for learning dynamic policies to optimize Anytime performance in visual architectures. Our model sequentially orders feature computation and performs subsequent classification. Crucially, decisions are made at test time and depend on observed data and intermediate results. We show the applicability of this system to standard problems in scene and object recognition. On suitable datasets, we can incorporate a semantic back-off strategy that gives maximally specific predictions for a desired level of accuracy, this provides a new view on the time course of human visual perception.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sergey Karayev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karayev:Sergey", "Mario Fritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fritz:Mario", "Trevor Darrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darrell:Trevor"], "pages": 8}
