{"title": "Optimal Action Extraction for Random Forests and Boosted Trees.", "fields": ["business intelligence", "decision tree", "adaboost", "integer programming", "random forest"], "abstract": "Additive tree models (ATMs) are widely used for data mining and machine learning. Important examples of ATMs include random forest, adaboost (with decision trees as weak learners), and gradient boosted trees, and they are often referred to as the best off-the-shelf classifiers. Though capable of attaining high accuracy, ATMs are not well interpretable in the sense that they do not provide actionable knowledge for a given instance. This greatly limits the potential of ATMs on many applications such as medical prediction and business intelligence, where practitioners need suggestions on actions that can lead to desirable outcomes with minimum costs.   To address this problem, we present a novel framework to post-process any ATM classifier to extract an optimal actionable plan that can change a given input to a desired class with a minimum cost. In particular, we prove the NP-hardness of the optimal action extraction problem for ATMs and formulate this problem in an integer linear programming formulation which can be efficiently solved by existing packages. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by conducting comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "authors": ["Zhicheng Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Zhicheng", "Wenlin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wenlin", "Yujie He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yujie", "Yixin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yixin"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
