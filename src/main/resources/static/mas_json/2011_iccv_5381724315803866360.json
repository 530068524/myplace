Starting from a multi-scale feature point extraction and description, a processing chain composed by feature matching and correspondence searching, ranking grouping and skimming is performed to select the most reliable correspondences over which the correct alignment is estimated. Pre-alignment is obtained in few seconds per million point images on a off-the-shelf PC architecture. The experimental setup aimed to demonstrate the system behavior with respect to a set of concurrent requirements and the obtained performance are significant in the perspective of a fast, robust and unconstrained 3D object reconstruction.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Brescia", "University of Brescia", "University of Brescia"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Francesco Bonarrigo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonarrigo:Francesco", "Alberto Signoroni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Signoroni:Alberto", "Riccardo Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Riccardo"], "pages": 8}
