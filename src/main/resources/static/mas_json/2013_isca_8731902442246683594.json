ACMPs can speed up parallel applications if they can identify and accelerate code segments that are critical for performance. Proposals already exist for using coarse-grained thread scheduling and fine-grained bottleneck acceleration. Unfortunately, there have been no proposals offered thus far to decide which code segments to accelerate in cases where both coarse-grained thread scheduling and fine-grained bottleneck acceleration could have value. This paper proposes Utility-Based Acceleration of Multithreaded Applications on Asymmetric CMPs (UBA), a cooperative software/hardware mechanism for identifying and accelerating the most likely critical code segments from a set of multithreaded applications running on an ACMP. The key idea is a new Utility of Acceleration metric that quantifies the performance benefit of accelerating a bottleneck or a thread by taking into account both the criticality and the expected speedup. UBA outperforms the best of two state-of-the-art mechanisms by 11% for single application workloads and by 7% for two-application workloads on an ACMP with 52 small cores and 3 large cores.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 A.
