Decision makers need to reason about data model interactions much as they do about data instance interactions in OLAP: at multiple levels of granularity. We demonstrate an integrated environment for exploring schema similarity across multiple resolutions. Users visualize and interact with clusters of related schemas using a tool named  Affinity . Within any cluster, users may drill-down to examine the extent and content of schema overlap. Further drill down enables users to explore fine-grained element-level correspondences between between two selected schemas.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kenneth P.
