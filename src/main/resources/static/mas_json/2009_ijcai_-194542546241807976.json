We study local pattern mining in the context of ProbLog, a probabilistic Prolog system, and introduce an approach for finding correlated patterns in the form of queries in such a Prolog system. The approach combines principles of inductive logic programming, data mining and statistical relational learning. Experiments on a challenging biological network mining task provide evidence for the interestingness of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Angelika Kimmig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimmig:Angelika", "Luc De Raedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raedt:Luc_De"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
