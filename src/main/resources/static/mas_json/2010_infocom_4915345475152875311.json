Examples for possible applications of this framework are mobile social networks, mobile conference calls, mobile instant messaging services, and mobile multi-player on-line games. A key requirement for enabling a real-time group communication service is the tight constraint imposed on the call delivery delay. Since establishing such communication service for a group of independent mobile users under a tight delay constraint is NP-hard, a two-tier architecture is proposed, that can meet the delay constraint imposed by the real-time service requirement for many independent mobile clients in a scalable manner. The time and memory complexity associated with the group services provided by the proposed framework are O(N) for each service, where N is the number of nodes being served, while a distributed scheme requires O(N^2) for both time and memory complexity", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Haifa", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Zohar Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Zohar", "Sajal K.
