In this extended abstract, we outline the approach of [Alechina et al., 2018], and show how, using ideas from scrip  systems,  we  can  design  mechanisms where the agents comprising the MAS are incen-tivised  to  monitor  the  actions  of  other  agents  for norm violations", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "Cornell University", "Microsoft", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Natasha Alechina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alechina:Natasha", "Joseph Y.
