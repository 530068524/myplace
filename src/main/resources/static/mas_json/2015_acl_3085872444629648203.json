While most existing approaches are driven by transfer learning, their performance does not reach to a promising level due to the transferred errors. In this paper, we propose to integrate into knowledge transfer a knowledge validation model, which aims to prevent the negative influence from the wrong knowledge by distinguishing highly credible knowledge. Experiment results demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of the model.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Wuhan University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Wuhan University", "Wuhan University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Qiang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qiang", "Wenjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenjie", "Yu Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Yu", "Xule Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xule", "Yanxiang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yanxiang"], "pages": 11}
