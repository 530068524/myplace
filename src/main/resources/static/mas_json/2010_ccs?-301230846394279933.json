Our PRF is the result of adapting the cascade construction, which is the basis of HMAC, to the algebraic settings. To do so we define an augmented cascade and prove it secure when the underlying PRF satisfies a property called parallel security. We then use the augmented cascade to build new algebraic PRFs. The algebraic structure of our PRF leads to an efficient large-domain Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and a large-domain simulatable VRF.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Hart William Montgomery.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montgomery:Hart_William", "Ananth Raghunathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghunathan:Ananth"], "pages": 10}
