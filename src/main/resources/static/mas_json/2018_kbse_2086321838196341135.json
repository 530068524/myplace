Incremental build systems enable short feedback cycles when they capture dependencies precisely and selectively execute build tasks efficiently. A much overlooked feature of build systems is the expressiveness of the scripting language, which directly influences the maintainability of build scripts. In this paper, we present a new incremental build algorithm that allows build engineers to use a full-fledged programming language with explicit task invocation, value and file inspection facilities, and conditional and iterative language constructs. In contrast to prior work on incrementality for such programmable builds, our algorithm scales with the number of tasks affected by a change and is independent of the size of the software project being built. Specifically, our algorithm accepts a set of changed files, transitively detects and re-executes affected build tasks, but also accounts for new task dependencies discovered during building. We have evaluated the performance of our algorithm in a real-world case study and confirm its scalability.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Gabri\u00ebl Konat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konat:Gabri=euml=l", "Sebastian Erdweg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erdweg:Sebastian", "Eelco Visser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Visser:Eelco"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
