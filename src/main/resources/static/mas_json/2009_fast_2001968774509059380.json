{"title": "BORG: Block-reORGanization for Self-optimizing Storage Systems.", "fields": ["implementation", "hypervisor", "file system", "workload", "locality of reference"], "abstract": "This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of BORG, a self-optimizing storage system that performs automatic block reorganization based on the observed I/O workload. BORG is motivated by three characteristics of I/O workloads: non-uniform access frequency distribution, temporal locality, and partial determinism in non-sequential accesses. To achieve its objective, BORG manages a small, dedicated partition on the disk drive, with the goal of servicing a majority of the I/O requests from within this partition with significantly reduced seek and rotational delays. BORG is transparent to the rest of the storage stack, including applications, file system(s), and I/O schedulers, thereby requiring no or minimal modification to storage stack implementations. We evaluated a Linux implementation of BORG using several real-world workloads, including individual user desktop environments, a web-server, a virtual machine monitor, and an SVN server. These experiments comprehensively demonstrate BORG's effectiveness in improving I/O performance and its incurred resource overhead.", "citation": "Citations (153)", "departments": ["Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Syracuse University"], "authors": ["Medha Bhadkamkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhadkamkar:Medha", "Jorge Guerra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerra:Jorge", "Luis Useche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Useche:Luis", "Sam Burnett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burnett:Sam", "Jason Liptak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liptak:Jason", "Raju Rangaswami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangaswami:Raju", "Vagelis Hristidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hristidis:Vagelis"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2009", "pages": 14}
