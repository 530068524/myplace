{"title": "Discriminative image warping with attribute flow.", "fields": ["image warping", "histogram matching", "histogram", "discriminative model", "histogram of oriented gradients"], "abstract": "We address the problem of finding deformation between two images for the purpose of recognizing objects. The challenge is that discriminative features are often transformation-variant (e.g. histogram of oriented gradients, texture), while transformation-invariant features (e.g. intensity, color) are often not discriminative. We introduce the concept of attribute flow which explicitly models how image attributes vary with its deformation. We develop a non-parametric method to approximate this using histogram matching, which can be solved efficiently using linear programming. Our method produces dense correspondence between images, and utilizes discriminative, transformation-variant features for simultaneous detection and alignment. Experiments on ETHZ shape categories dataset show that we can accurately recognize highly de-formable objects with few training examples.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Weiyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Weiyu", "Praveen Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Praveen", "Jianbo Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jianbo"], "pages": 8}
