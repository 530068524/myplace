This process of analogy searching is difficult for both humans and machines. In this paper, we present a novel approach for re-presenting a problem in terms of its abstract structure, and then allowing people to use this structural representation to find analogies. We propose a crowdsourcing process that helps people navigate a large dataset to find analogies. Through two experiments, we show the benefits of using abstract structural representations to search for ideas that are analogous to a source problem, and that these analogies result in better solutions than alternative approaches. This work provides a useful method for finding analogies, and can streamline innovation for both novices and professional designers.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Lixiu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Lixiu", "Aniket Kittur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kittur:Aniket", "Robert E.
