{"title": "A model for WLAN signal attenuation of the human body.", "fields": ["signal strength", "human computer interaction", "distortion", "attenuation", "offset"], "abstract": "Fingerprinting-based indoor localization involves building a signal strength radio map. This map is usually built manually by a person holding the mapping device, which results in orientation-dependent fingerprints due to signal attenuation by the human body. To offset this distortion, fingerprints are typically collected for multiple orientations, but this requires a high effort for large localization areas. In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the mapping effort by modeling the WLAN signal attenuation caused by the human body. By applying the model to the captured signal to compensate for the attenuation, it is possible to generate an orientation-independent fingerprint. We demonstrate that our model is location and person independent and its output is comparable with manually created radio maps. By using the model, the WLAN scanning effort can be reduced by 75% to 87.5% (depending on the number of orientations).", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Duisburg-Essen", "University of Duisburg-Essen", "University of Duisburg-Essen"], "authors": ["Ngewi Fet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fet:Ngewi", "Marcus Handte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Handte:Marcus", "Pedro Jos\u00e9 Marr\u00f3n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marr=oacute=n:Pedro_Jos=eacute="], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
