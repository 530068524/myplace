{"title": "DSybil: Optimal Sybil-Resistance for Recommendation Systems.", "fields": ["recommender system", "voting behavior", "internet privacy", "botnet", "sybil attack"], "abstract": "Recommendation systems can be attacked in various ways, and the ultimate attack form is reached with a {\\em sybil attack}, where the attacker creates a potentially unlimited number of {\\em sybil identities} to vote. Defending against sybil attacks is often quite challenging, and the nature of recommendation systems makes it even harder. This paper presents {\\em DSybil}, a novel defense for diminishing the influence of sybil identities in recommendation systems. DSybil provides strong provable guarantees that hold even under the worst-case attack and are optimal. DSybil can defend against an unlimited number of sybil identities over time. DSybil achieves its strong guarantees by i) exploiting the heavy-tail distribution of the typical voting behavior of the honest identities, and ii) carefully identifying whether the system is already getting ``enough help'' from the (weighted) voters already taken into account or whether more ``help'' is needed. Our evaluation shows that DSybil would continue to provide high-quality recommendations even when a million-node botnet uses an optimal strategy to launch a sybil attack.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Intel", "Intel", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Haifeng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Haifeng", "Chenwei Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Chenwei", "Michael Kaminsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaminsky:Michael", "Phillip B.
