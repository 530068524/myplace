No prior knowledge is required of scene structure or camera calibration allowing reconstruction from multiple moving cameras. Sparse-to-dense temporal correspondence is integrated with joint multi-view segmentation and reconstruction to obtain a complete 4D representation of static and dynamic objects. Temporal coherence is exploited to overcome visual ambiguities resulting in improved reconstruction of complex scenes. Robust joint segmentation and reconstruction of dynamic objects is achieved by introducing a geodesic star convexity constraint. Comparative evaluation is performed on a variety of unstructured indoor and outdoor dynamic scenes with hand-held cameras and multiple people. This demonstrates reconstruction of complete temporally coherent 4D scene models with improved nonrigid object segmentation and shape reconstruction.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "University of Surrey"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Armin Mustafa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mustafa:Armin", "Hansung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hansung", "Jean-Yves Guillemaut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guillemaut:Jean=Yves", "Adrian Hilton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hilton:Adrian"], "pages": 10}
