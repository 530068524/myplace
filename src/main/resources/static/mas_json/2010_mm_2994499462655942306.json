The stream explorer allows to explore and to segment video streams. The video explorer shows a synthetic view of structured TV programmes. The collection explorer proposes cartographies of large video collections. Based on visual and textual automatic processing, proximities and redundancies are analyzed, allowing the emergence of different levels of structure. This is made possible thanks to the volume of data considered: 7 channels during 100 days, ie 16000 hours or 20 Millions key frames. These three tools allow efficient exploration of video contents at different levels of interest: image, shot and sequence, programme and collection level.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["INA, Bry-sur-Marne, France", "INA, Bry-sur-Marne, France", "INA, Bry-sur-Marne, France", "INA, Bry-sur-Marne, France"], "authors": ["Marie-Luce Viaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viaud:Marie=Luce", "Olivier Buisson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buisson:Olivier", "Agn\u00e8s Saulnier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saulnier:Agn=egrave=s", "Clement Guenais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guenais:Clement"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
