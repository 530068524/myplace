Through an ethnographic account of the elements of community-based research normally elided from reports of design process, we explore how the impact of institutional histories and personal relationships went beyond simply identifying potential partners, but fundamentally guided the research questions and approach. We examine the different roles researchers play - researcher, confidant, advocate, interloper, invader, and collaborator - and how those roles create particular relations in the field. The contribution of this work is the development of a reflective account of the research in order to evaluate knowledge production, rigor, and advance methods for engaging in community-based research.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Christopher A.
