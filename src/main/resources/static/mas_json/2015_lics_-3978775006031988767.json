Intuitively, each configuration of a given pVASS is assigned one of finitely many patterns, and every run can thus be seen as an infinite sequence of these patterns. The pattern frequency vector assigns to each run the limit of pattern frequencies computed for longer and longer prefixes of the run. If the limit does not exist, then the vector is undefined. We show that for one-counter pVASS, the pattern frequency vector is defined and takes one of finitely many values for almost all runs. Further, these values and their associated probabilities can be approximated up to an arbitrarily small relative error in polynomial time. For stable two-counter pVASS, we show the same result, but we do not provide any upper complexity bound. As a byproduct of our study, we discover counterexamples falsifying some classical results about stochastic Petri nets published in the 80s.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Masaryk University", "University of Oxford", "Masaryk University", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s Br\u00e1zdil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=aacute=zdil:Tom=aacute=s", "Stefan Kiefer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiefer:Stefan", "Anton\u00edn Kucera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kucera:Anton=iacute=n", "Petr Novotn\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novotn=yacute=_0001:Petr"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
