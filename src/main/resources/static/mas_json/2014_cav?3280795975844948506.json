The validity of all discharged verification conditions implies that the program executed by any number of threads satisfies the specification. Currently, Leap includes not only decision procedures for integers and Booleans, but it also implements specific theories for heap memory layouts such as linked-lists and skiplists.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["IMDEA", "IMDEA"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Alejandro S\u00e1nchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=aacute=nchez:Alejandro", "C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=aacute=nchez:C=eacute=sar"], "pages": 8}
