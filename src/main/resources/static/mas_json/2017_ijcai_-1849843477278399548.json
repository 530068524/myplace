{"title": "Retaining Data from Streams of Social Platforms with Minimal Regret.", "fields": ["data stream mining", "data stream", "streaming data", "information quality", "regret"], "abstract": "Today's social platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, continuously generate massive volumes of data. The resulting data streams exceed any reasonable limit for permanent storage, especially since data is often redundant, overlapping, sparse, and generally of low value. This calls for means to retain solely a small fraction of the data in an online manner. In this paper, we propose techniques to effectively decide which data to retain, such that the induced loss of information, the regret of neglecting certain data, is minimized. These techniques enable not only efficient processing of massive streaming data, but are also adaptive and address the dynamic nature of social media. Experiments on large-scale real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of our approach in terms of both, runtime and information quality.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Humboldt University of Berlin", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Queensland", "Griffith University"], "authors": ["Nguyen Thanh Tam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tam:Nguyen_Thanh", "Matthias Weidlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weidlich:Matthias", "Duong Chi Thang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thang:Duong_Chi", "Hongzhi Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Hongzhi", "Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hung:Nguyen_Quoc_Viet"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
