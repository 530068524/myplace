{"title": "Scheduling Design and Verification for Open Soft Real-Time Systems.", "fields": ["two level scheduling", "state variable", "markov decision process", "nurse scheduling problem", "dynamic priority scheduling"], "abstract": "Open soft real-time systems, such as mobile robots, experience unpredictable interactions with their environments and yet must respond both adaptively and with reasonable temporal predictability. New scheduling approaches are needed to address the demands of such systems, in which many of the assumptions made by traditional real-time scheduling theory do not hold. In previous work we established foundations for a scheduling policy design and verification approach for open soft real-time systems, that can use different decision models, e.g., a Markov decision process (MDP), to capture the nuances of their scheduling semantics.However, several important refinements to the preliminary techniques developed in that work are needed to make the approach applicable in practice. This paper makes three main contributions to the state of the art in scheduling open soft real-time systems: (1) it defines a novel representation of the scheduling state space that is both more compact and more expressive than the model defined in our previous work; (2) it exploits regular structure of that representation to allow efficient verification of properties involving both discrete and continuous system state variables under specific scheduling policies; and (3) it removes the unnecessary use of a time horizon in our previous approach, thus allowing the more precise specification and enforcement of a wider range of scheduling policies for open soft real-time systems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Robert Glaubius.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glaubius:Robert", "Terry Tidwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tidwell:Terry", "William D.
