The basic idea is to start human tracking without prior knowledge about the performed actions. The resulting 3D motion sequences, which may be corrupted due to tracking errors, are locally classified according to available motion categories. Depending on the classification result, a retrieval system supplies suitable motion priors, which are then used to regularize and stabilize the tracking in the next iteration step. Experiments with the HumanEVA-II benchmark show that tracking and classification are remarkably improved after few iterations.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Leibniz Univers ... eitung, Germany"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Xue Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Xue", "Haibin Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Haibin"], "pages": 8}
