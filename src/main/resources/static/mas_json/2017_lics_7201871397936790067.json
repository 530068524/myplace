The fixpoint character of common knowledge modalities and the role that reachability and transitive closures play for the derived accessibility relations take our analysis beyond classical model-theoretic terrain and technically pose a novel challenge to the analysis of model-theoretic games. Over and above the more familiar locality-based techniques we exploit a specific structure theory for specially adapted Cayley groups: through the association of agents with sets of generators, all epistemic frames can be represented up to bisimilarity by suitable Cayley groups with specific acyclicity properties; these support a locality analysis at different levels of granularity as induced by distance measures w.r.t. various coalitions of agents.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Felix Canavoi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canavoi:Felix", "Martin Otto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otto_0001:Martin"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
