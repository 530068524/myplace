Most recent studies have mainly focused on addressing the technical limitations caused by special requirements for writes in flash memory. However, a unique merit of an SSD is its rich internal parallelism, which allows us to offset for the most part of the performance loss related to technical limitations by significantly increasing data processing throughput. In this work we present a comprehensive study of essential roles of internal parallelism of SSDs in high-speed data processing. Besides substantially improving I/O bandwidth (e.g. 7.2\u00d7), we show that by exploiting internal parallelism, SSD performance is no longer highly sensitive to access patterns, but rather to other factors, such as data access interferences and physical data layout. Specifically, through extensive experiments and thorough analysis, we obtain the following new findings in the context of concurrent data processing in SSDs. (1) Write performance is largely independent of access patterns (regardless of being sequential or random), and can even outperform reads, which is opposite to the long-existing common understanding about slow writes on SSDs. (2) One performance concern comes from interference between concurrent reads and writes, which causes substantial performance degradation. (3) Parallel I/O performance is sensitive to physical data-layout mapping, which is largely not observed without parallelism. (4) Existing application designs optimized for magnetic disks can be suboptimal for running on SSDs with parallelism. Our study is further supported by a group of case studies in database systems as typical data-intensive applications. With these critical findings, we give a set of recommendations to application designers and system architects for exploiting internal parallelism and maximizing the performance potential of SSDs.", "citation": "Citations (221)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Feng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0005:Feng", "Rubao Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Rubao", "Xiaodong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Xiaodong"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
