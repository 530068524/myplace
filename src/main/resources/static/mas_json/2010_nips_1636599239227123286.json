{"title": "Factorized Latent Spaces with Structured Sparsity.", "fields": ["convex optimization", "machine learning", "pose", "neural coding", "modalities"], "abstract": "Recent approaches to multi-view learning have shown that factorizing the information into parts that are shared across all views and parts that are private to each view could effectively account for the dependencies and independencies between the different input modalities. Unfortunately, these approaches involve minimizing non-convex objective functions. In this paper, we propose an approach to learning such factorized representations inspired by sparse coding techniques. In particular, we show that structured sparsity allows us to address the multi-view learning problem by alternately solving two convex optimization problems. Furthermore, the resulting factorized latent spaces generalize over existing approaches in that they allow having latent dimensions shared between any subset of the views instead of between all the views only. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the task of human pose estimation.", "citation": "Citations (142)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "TTI-Chicago"], "authors": ["Yangqing Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yangqing", "Mathieu Salzmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salzmann:Mathieu", "Trevor Darrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darrell:Trevor"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
