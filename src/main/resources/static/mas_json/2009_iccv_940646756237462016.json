In order to determine the best tracking algorithm and parameters for a given application, a comprehensive evaluation procedure is required. However, despite half a century of research in multi-target tracking, there is no consensus on how to score the overall performance of these trackers. Existing evaluation approaches assess tracker performance through measures of correspondence between ground truth tracks and system tracks using metrics such as track detection rate, track completeness, track fragmentation rate, and track ID change rate. However, each of these only provides a partial measure of performance and no good method exists to combine them into a holistic metric. Towards this end, this paper presents a pair of information theoretic metrics with similar behavior to the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves of signal detection theory. Overall performance is evaluated with the percentage of truth information that a tracker captured and the total amount of false information that it reported. Information content is quantified through conditional entropy and mutual information computations using numerical estimates of the probability of association between the truth and the system tracks. This paper demonstrates how these information quality metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of overall tracker performance and how they can be used to perform tracker comparisons and parameter tuning on wide-area surveillance imagery and other applications. 1", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Edward K.
