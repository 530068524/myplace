{"title": "Two is Better Than One: Improving Multilingual Collaboration by Giving Two Machine Translation Outputs.", "fields": ["speech recognition", "mandarin chinese", "dyad", "natural language processing", "machine translation"], "abstract": "Machine translation (MT) creates both opportunities and challenges for multilingual collaboration: While MT enables collaborators to communicate via their native languages, it can introduce errors that make communication difficult. In the current paper, we examine whether displaying two alternative translations for each message will improve conversational grounding and task performance. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which monolingual native English speakers collaborated with bilingual native Mandarin speakers on a map navigation task. Each dyad performed the task in one of three communication conditions: MT with single output, MT with two outputs, and English as a common language. Dyads given two translations for each message communicated more efficiently, and performed better on the task, than dyads given one translation. Our findings show the value of providing multiple translations in multilingual collaboration, and suggest design features of future MT-based collaboration tools.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Ge Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Ge", "Bin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0002:Bin", "David C.
