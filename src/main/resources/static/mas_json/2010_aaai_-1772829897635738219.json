In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic analysis of a reputation mechanism that objectively maintains accurate reputation evaluation of selfish agent-based web services. In this framework, web services are ranked using their reputation as a result of provided feedback reflecting consumers' satisfaction about the offered services. However, selfish web services may alter their public reputation level by managing to get fake feedback. In this paper, game-theoretic analysis investigates the payoffs of different situations and elaborates on the facts that discourage web services to act maliciously.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur"], "authors": ["Babak Khosravifar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khosravifar:Babak", "Jamal Bentahar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bentahar:Jamal", "Ahmad Moazin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moazin:Ahmad", "Philippe Thiran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thiran:Philippe"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
