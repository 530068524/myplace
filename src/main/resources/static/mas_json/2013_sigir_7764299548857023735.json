The first stage is to partition the data and group potentially similar vectors. The second stage is to run a set of tasks where each task compares a partition of vectors with other candidate partitions. Because of data sparsity, accessing feature vectors in memory for runtime comparison in the second stage, incurs significant overhead due to the presence of memory hierarchy. This paper proposes a cache-conscious data layout and traversal optimization to reduce the execution time through size-controlled data splitting and vector coalescing. It also provides an analysis to guide the optimal choice for the parameter setting. Our evaluation with several application datasets verifies the performance gains obtained by the optimization and shows that the proposed scheme is upto 2.74x as fast as the cache-oblivious baseline.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Maha Alabduljalil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alabduljalil:Maha", "Xun Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xun", "Tao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0009:Tao"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
