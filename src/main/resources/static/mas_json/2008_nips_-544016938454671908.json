Our algorithm has a quadratic runtime while those in [1] is cubic. In experiments, we were surprised to find that in addition to being more efficient, it is also a better sequential Monte Carlo sampler than the best in [1], when measured in terms of variance of estimated likelihood and effective sample size.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Dilan G\u00f6r\u00fcr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml=r=uuml=r:Dilan", "Yee Whye Teh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teh:Yee_Whye"], "pages": 8}
