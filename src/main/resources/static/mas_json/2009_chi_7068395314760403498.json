{"title": "Designing trustworthy situated services: an implicit and explicit assessment of locative images-effect on trust.", "fields": ["phishing", "communication design", "preconscious", "situated", "locative case"], "abstract": "This paper examines a visual design element unique to situated, hot-spot style, services: locativeness. This is the extent to which the media representing a service relates to its immediate physical environment. This paper explores the effect of locativeness on trust with two studies assessing user attitudes in depth. The first is an implicit, or preconscious, test and the second an explicit test based on voiced value judgments. To provide a richer context, the second study contrasts locativeness with other traditional aspects of design: branding and quality. The results indicate users have a strong implicit association between locative images and trust, and that this is partially reflected in their explicit choices. This is an important interface aspect that designers should consider in order to create trustworthy situated services.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Madeira", "University of Madeira"], "authors": ["Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis", "Ian Oakley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oakley:Ian"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
