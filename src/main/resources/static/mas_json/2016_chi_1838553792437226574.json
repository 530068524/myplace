{"title": "Facilitator, Functionary, Friend or Foe?: Studying the Role of iPads within Learning Activities Across a School Year.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "longitudinal study", "multimedia", "facilitator", "physical education"], "abstract": "We present the findings from a longitudinal study of iPad use in a Primary school classroom. While tablet devices have found their way into classroom environments, we still lack in-depth and long-term studies of how they integrate into everyday classroom activities. Our findings illustrate in-classroom tablet use and the broad range of learning activities in subjects such as maths, languages, social sciences, and even physical education. Our observations expand current models on teaching and learning supported by tablet technology. Our findings are child-centred, focusing on three different roles that tablets can play as part of learning activities: Friend, Functionary, and Facilitator. This new perspective on in-classroom tablet use can facilitate critical discussions around the integration and impact of these devices in the educational context, from a design and educational point of view.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of St Andrews", "University of St Andrews", "University of Central Lancashire", "University of St Andrews"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Anne-Marie Mann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mann:Anne=Marie", "Uta Hinrichs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hinrichs:Uta", "Janet C.
