{"title": "A demonstration of simultaneous execution and editing in a development environment.", "fields": ["debugging", "programmer", "development environment", "control flow", "graphics"], "abstract": "We introduce a tool within the Code Bubbles development environment that allows for continuous execution as the programmer edits. The tool, SEEDE, shows both the intermediate and final results of execution in terms of variables, control flow, output, and graphics. These results are updated as the user edits. The user can explore the execution to find or fix bugs or use the intermediate values to help write appropriate code.
