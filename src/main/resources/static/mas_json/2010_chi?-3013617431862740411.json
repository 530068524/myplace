One remedy to this problem, and the focus of this paper, is to  motivate  sustainable energy usage  behaviors  by people. One approach is the development of technologies that provide real-time, continuous feedback of energy usage. However, there is one problem - most tech-nologies use a \"one-size-fits-all\" solution, providing the  same  feedback to  differently  motivated individuals at different stages of readiness, willingness and ableness to change. In this paper, we synthesize a wide range of motivational psychology literature to develop a  motivational framework  based on the Transtheoretical (aka Stages of Behavior Change) Model. For each stage, we state the mo-tivational goal(s), and recommendation(s) for how technol-ogies can reach these goals. Each goal and recommendation is supported by a rationale based on motivational literature. Each recommendation is supported by a simple textual example illustrating one way to apply the recommendation.", "citation": "Citations (257)", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Helen Ai He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Helen_Ai", "Saul Greenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenberg:Saul", "Elaine M.
