{"title": "Legacy Contact: Designing and Implementing Post-mortem Stewardship at Facebook.", "fields": ["social media", "social network", "memorialization", "data management", "honor"], "abstract": "Post-mortem profiles on social network sites serve as both an archive of the deceased person's life and a gathering place for friends and loved ones. Many existing systems utilize inheritance as a model for post-mortem data management. However, the social and networked nature of personal data on social media, as well as the memorializing practices in which friends engage, indicate that other approaches are necessary. In this paper, we articulate the design choices made throughout the development of Legacy Contact, a post-mortem data management solution designed and deployed at Facebook. Building on the duties and responsibilities identified by Brubaker et al., we describe how Legacy Contact was designed to honor last requests, provide information surrounding death, preserve the memory of the deceased, and facilitate memorializing practices. We provide details around the design of the Legacy Contact selection process, the functionality provided to legacy contacts after accounts have been memorialized, and changes made to post-mortem profiles.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "Facebook"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jed R.
