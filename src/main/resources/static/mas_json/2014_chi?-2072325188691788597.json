{"title": "Making big gestures: effects of gesture size on observability and identification for co-located group awareness.", "fields": ["morphology", "identifiability", "observability", "human computer interaction", "gesture"], "abstract": "Co-located work environments allow people to maintain awareness by observing others' actions (called consequen-tial communication), but the computerization of many tasks has dramatically reduced the observability of work actions. The recent interest in gestural interaction techniques offers the possibility of recreating some of the noticeability of previous work actions, but little is known about the observability and identifiability of command gestures. To investigate these basic issues, we carried out a study that asked people to observe and identify different sizes and morphologies of gestures from different locations, while carrying out an attention-demanding primary task. We studied small (tablet sized), medium (monitor-sized), and large (full-arm) gestures. Our study showed that although size did have significant effects, as expected, even small gestures were highly noticeable (rates above 75%) and identifiable (rates above 69%). Our results provide empirical guidance about the ways that gesture size, morphology, and location affect observation, and show that gestural interaction has potential for improving group awareness in co-located environments.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Adrian Reetz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reetz:Adrian", "Carl Gutwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gutwin:Carl"], "pages": 10}
