This approximation must be robust to the kernel parameters, for example the bandwidth for the Gaussian kernel. We consider two approximation methods: Nystrom and an algebraic treecode developed in our group. Nystrom methods construct a global low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix. Treecodes approximate just the off-diagonal blocks, typically using a hierarchical decomposition.   We present a theoretical error analysis of our treecode and relate it to the error of Nystrom methods. Our analysis reveals how the block-rank structure of the kernel matrix controls the performance of the treecode. We evaluate our treecode by comparing it to the classical Nystrom method and a state-of-the-art fast approximate Nystrom method. We test the kernel matrix approximation accuracy for several different bandwidths and datasets. On the MNIST2M dataset (2M points in 784 dimensions) for a Gaussian kernel with bandwidth  h=1 , the Nystrom methods' error is over 90% whereas our treecode delivers error less than 1%.   We also test the performance of the three methods on binary classification using two models: a Bayes classifier and kernel ridge regression. Our evaluation reveals the existence of bandwidth values that should be examined in cross-validation but whose corresponding kernel matrices cannot be approximated well by Nystrom methods. In contrast, the treecode scheme performs much better for these values.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["William B.
