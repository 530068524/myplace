We show that different priors result in different decompositions of information between the latent code and the autoregressive decoder. For example, by imposing a Gaussian distribution as the prior, we can achieve a global vs. local decomposition, or by imposing a categorical distribution as the prior, we can disentangle the style and content information of images in an unsupervised fashion. We further show how the PixelGAN autoencoder with a categorical prior can be directly used in semi-supervised settings and achieve competitive semi-supervised classification results on the MNIST, SVHN and NORB datasets.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alireza Makhzani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makhzani:Alireza", "Brendan J.
