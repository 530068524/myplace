{"title": "When data acquisition meets data analytics: A distributed active learning framework for optimal budgeted mobile crowdsensing.", "fields": ["activity recognition", "data analysis", "upload", "active learning", "mobile search"], "abstract": "An important category of mobile crowdsensing applications involve collecting sensor measurements from mobile devices and querying mobile users for annotations to build machine learning models for inference and prediction. Trade-offs between inference performance and the costs of data acquisition (both unlabeled and labeled) are not yet well understood. In this paper, we develop, ALSense, a distributed active learning framework for mobile crowdsensing. The goal is to minimize prediction errors for classification-based mobile crowdsensing tasks subject to upload and query cost constraints. Novel stream-based active learning strategies are developed to orchestrate queries of annotation data and the upload of unlabeled data from mobile devices. We evaluate the effectiveness of ALSense through two applications that can benefit from mobile crowdsensing, namely, WiFi fingerprint-based indoor localization and IMU-based human activity recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALSense can indeed achieve higher classification accuracy given fixed data acquisition budgets for both applications.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["McMaster University", "McMaster University"], "authors": ["Qiang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Qiang", "Rong Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Rong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
