There still exist many challenges for DFL for multiple targets without dense deployment of sensor nodes. To fit the gap, in this paper, we propose a multi-target localization method based on compressive sensing, named LCS. The key observation is that given a pair of nodes, the received signal strength (RSS) will be different when a target locates at different locations. Taking advantage of compressive sensing in sparse recovery to handle the sparse property of the localization problem, (i.e., the vector which contains the number and location information of k targets is an ideal k-sparse signal), we presented a scalable compressive sensing based multiple target counting and localization method i.e., LCS, and rigorously justify the validity of the problem formulation. The results from our realistic deployment in a 12m\u00d712m open space are promising. For 12 people with 24 nodes, the worst localization error ratio and counting error ratio of our LCS is no more than 8.3% and 33.3% respectively.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Northwest University", "Northwest University", "Northwest University", "University of Victoria", "Northwest University"], "authors": ["Ju Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ju", "Dingyi Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Dingyi", "Xiaojiang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiaojiang", "Zhe Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhe", "Tianzhang Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Tianzhang", "Lin Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai_0001:Lin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
