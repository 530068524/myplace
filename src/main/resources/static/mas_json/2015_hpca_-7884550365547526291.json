{"title": "SCOC: High-radix switches made of bufferless clos networks.", "fields": ["latency", "speedup", "clos network", "big data", "ranging"], "abstract": "In today's datacenters handling big data and for exascale computers of tomorrow, there is a pressing need for high-radix switches to economically and efficiently unify the computing and storage resources that are dispersed across multiple racks. In this paper, we present SCOC, a switch architecture suitable for economical IC implementation that can efficiently replace crossbars for high-radix switch nodes. SCOC is a multi-stage bufferless network with O(N 2 /m) cost, where m is a design parameter, practically ranging between 4\u201316. We identify and resolve more than five fairness violations that are pertinent to hierarchical scheduling. Effectively, from a performance perspective, SCOC is indistinguishable from efficient flat crossbars. Computer simulations show that it competes well or even outperforms flat crossbars and hierarchical switches. We report data from our ASIC implementation at 32 nm of a SCOC 136\u00d7136 switch, with shallow buffers, connecting 25 Gb/s links. In this first incarnation, SCOC is used at the spines of a server-rack, fat-tree network. Internally, it runs at 9.9 Tb/s, thus offering a speedup of 1.45 \u00d7, and provides a fall-through latency of just 61 ns.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Nikolaos Chrysos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chrysos:Nikolaos", "Cyriel Minkenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minkenberg:Cyriel", "Mark Rudquist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudquist:Mark", "Claude Basso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basso:Claude", "Brian Vanderpool.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanderpool:Brian"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
