In this paper, we observe and make use of the DelinquentPC \u2014 Next-Use characteristic to improve shared cache performance. We propose a new PC-centric cache organization, NUcache, for the shared last level cache of multi-cores. NUcache logically partitions the associative ways of a cache set into MainWays and DeliWays. While all lines have access to the MainWays, only lines brought in by a subset of delinquent PCs, selected by a PC selection mechanism, are allowed to enter the DeliWays. The PC selection mechanism is an intelligent cost-benefit analysis based algorithm that utilizes Next-Use information to select the set of PCs that can maximize the hits experienced in DeliWays. Performance evaluation reveals that NUcache improves the performance over a baseline design by 9.6%, 30% and 33% respectively for dual, quad and eight core workloads comprised of SPEC benchmarks. We also show that NUcache is more effective than other well-known cache-partitioning algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Microsoft", "Indian Institute of Science"], "authors": ["R.
