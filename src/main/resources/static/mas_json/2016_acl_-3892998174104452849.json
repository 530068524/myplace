{"title": "Learning the Curriculum with Bayesian Optimization for Task-Specific Word Representation Learning.", "fields": ["bayesian optimization", "feature learning", "scalar", "weight", "multi task learning"], "abstract": "We use Bayesian optimization to learn curricula for word representation learning, optimizing performance on downstream tasks that depend on the learned representations as features. The curricula are modeled by a linear ranking function which is the scalar product of a learned weight vector and an engineered feature vector that characterizes the different aspects of the complexity of each instance in the training corpus. We show that learning the curriculum improves performance on a variety of downstream tasks over random orders and in comparison to the natural corpus order.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Google", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yulia Tsvetkov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsvetkov:Yulia", "Manaal Faruqui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faruqui:Manaal", "Wang Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Wang", "Brian MacWhinney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/MacWhinney:Brian", "Chris Dyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dyer:Chris"], "pages": -1}
