{"title": "Smart Personalized Routing for Smart Cities.", "fields": ["graph", "personalization", "synthetic data", "data management", "instruction set"], "abstract": "In smart cities, commuters have the opportunities for smart routing that may enable selecting a route with less car accidents, or one that is more scenic, or perhaps a straight and flat route. Such smart personalization requires a data management framework that goes beyond a static road network graph. This paper introduces PreGo, a novel system developed to provide real time personalized routing. The recommended routes by PreGo are smart and personalized in the sense of being (1) adjustable to individual users preferences, (2) subjective to the trip start time, and (3) sensitive to changes of the road conditions. Extensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic data demonstrates the efficiency of the PreGo system.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Washington", "University of Virginia", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Abdeltawab M.
