For example, \u201cBlack Mamba\u201d, the name for a highly venomous snake, is a morph that Kobe Bryant created for himself due to his agility and aggressiveness in playing basketball games. This paper presents the first end-to-end context-aware entity morph decoding system that can automatically identify, disambiguate, verify morph mentions based on specific contexts, and resolve them to target entities. Our approach is based on an absolute \u201ccold-start\u201d it does not require any candidate morph or target entity lists as input, nor any manually constructed morph-target pairs for training. We design a semi-supervised collective inference framework for morph mention extraction, and compare various deep learning based approaches for morph resolution. Our approach achieved significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method (Huang et al., 2013), which used a large amount of training data. 1", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Peking University", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Peking University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Boliang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Boliang", "Hongzhao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Hongzhao", "Xiaoman Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Xiaoman", "Sujian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Sujian", "Chin-Yew Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chin=Yew", "Heng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Heng", "Kevin Knight.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knight:Kevin", "Zhen Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Zhen", "Yizhou Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yizhou", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "B\u00fclent Yener.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yener:B=uuml=lent"], "pages": 10}
