{"title": "Refractive height fields from single and multiple images.", "fields": ["iterative reconstruction", "planar", "deflection", "surface reconstruction", "refraction"], "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for reconstructing homogenous, transparent, refractive height-fields from a single viewpoint. The height-field is imaged against a known planar background, or sequence of backgrounds. Unlike existing approaches that do a point-by-point reconstruction \u2014 which is known to have intractable ambiguities \u2014 our method estimates and optimizes for the entire height-field at the same time. The formulation supports shape recovery from measured distortions (deflections) or directly from the images themselves, including from a single image. We report results for a variety of refractive height-fields showing significant improvement over prior art.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Google", "University of Washington"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Qi Shan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shan:Qi", "Sameer Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Sameer", "Brian Curless.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curless:Brian"], "pages": 8}
