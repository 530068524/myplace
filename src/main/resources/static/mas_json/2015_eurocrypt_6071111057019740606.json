The so-called information set decoding algorithm of Prange (1962) achieves worst-case complexity \\(2^{0.121n}\\). In the late 80s, Stern proposed a sort-and-match version for Prange\u2019s algorithm, on which all variants of the currently best known decoding algorithms are build. The fastest algorithm of Becker, Joux, May and Meurer (2012) achieves running time \\(2^{0.102n}\\) in the full distance decoding setting and \\(2^{0.0494n}\\) with half (bounded) distance decoding.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Alexander May.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/May_0001:Alexander", "Ilya Ozerov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ozerov:Ilya"], "pages": 26}
