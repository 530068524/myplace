Although STMs are gaining popularity because of significant improvements in parallel performance, they exhibit enormous variation in transaction execution with non-repeatable performance behavior which is unacceptable in many application domains, especially in which frame rates and responsiveness should be predictable. Thus, reducing execution variance in STM is an important performance goal that has been mostly overlooked. In this work, we minimize the variance in execution time of threads in STM by reducing non-determinism exhibited due to speculation by first quantifying non-determinism and generating an automaton that models the behavior of STM. We used the automaton to guide the STM to a less non-deterministic execution that reduced the variance in frame rate by a maximum of 65% on a version of real-world Quake3 game.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Girish Mururu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mururu:Girish", "Ada Gavrilovska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavrilovska:Ada", "Santosh Pande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pande:Santosh"], "pages": 2}
