{"title": "Proactive fault-tolerant aggregation protocol for privacy-assured smart metering.", "fields": ["metering mode", "demand response", "smart meter", "overhead", "differential privacy"], "abstract": "Smart meters are integral to demand response in emerging smart grids, by reporting the electricity consumption of users to serve application needs. But reporting real-time usage information for individual households raises privacy concerns. Existing techniques to guarantee differential privacy (DP) of smart meter users either are not fault tolerant or achieve (possibly partial) fault tolerance at high communication overheads. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant protocol for smart metering that can handle general communication failures while ensuring DP with significantly improved efficiency and lower errors compared with the state of the art. Our protocol handles fail-stop faults proactively by using a novel design of future ciphertexts, and distributes trust among the smart meters by sharing secret keys among them. We prove the DP properties of our protocol and analyze its advantages in fault tolerance, accuracy, and communication efficiency relative to competing techniques. We illustrate our analysis by simulations driven by real-world traces of electricity consumption.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Adv.
