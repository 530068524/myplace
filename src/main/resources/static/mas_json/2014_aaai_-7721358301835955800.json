To provide assistance in developing these ethical principles, we have developed GENETH, a general ethical dilemma analyzer that, through a dialog with ethicists, codifies ethical principles in any given domain. GENETH has been used to codify principles in a number of domains pertinent to the behavior of autonomous systems and these principles have been verified using an Ethical Turing Test.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Connecticut", "Dept. of Comput ...
