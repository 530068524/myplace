The goal of the vendors is to maximize their revenue via pricing of the items, given that the buyer will buy the set of items that maximizes his net payoff.\n\nWe show this game may not always have a pure Nash equilibrium, in contrast to previous results for the special case where each vendor owns a single item. We do so by relating our game to an intermediate, discrete game in which the vendors only choose the available items, and their prices are set exogenously afterwards.\n\nWe further make use of the intermediate game to provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy for the subset games that have pure Nash equilibria; we find that the optimal PoA reached in the previous special cases does not hold, but only a logarithmic one. Finally, we show that for a special case of submod-ular functions, efficient pure Nash equilibria always exist.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Omer Lev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lev:Omer", "Joel Oren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oren:Joel", "Craig Boutilier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boutilier:Craig", "Jeffrey S.
