In contrast to point-to-point, interference-limited communications considered in prior works, we propose active cooperative relaying based schemes. We consider a network with legitimate nodes, eavesdroppers, and path loss exponent . As long as , for some positive , we show one can obtain unbounded secure aggregate rate. This means zero-cost secure communication, given fixed total power constraint for the entire network. We achieve this result through (i) the source using Wyner randomized encoder and a serial (multi-stage) block Markov scheme, to cooperate with the relays and (ii) the relays acting as a virtual multi-antenna to apply beamforming against the eavesdroppers. Our simpler parallel (two-stage) relaying scheme can achieve the same unbounded secure aggregate rate when holds, for some positive .", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["KTH R.
