{"title": "Proof Protocol for a Machine Learning Technique Making Longitudinal Predictions in Dynamic Contexts.", "fields": ["efficient market hypothesis", "verifiable secret sharing", "design of experiments", "big data", "computability"], "abstract": "We demonstrate a protocol for proving strongly that a black-box machine learning technique robustly predicts the future in dynamic, indefinite contexts. We propose necessary components of the proof protocol and demonstrate results visualizations to support evaluation of the proof components. Components include contemporaneously verifiable discrete predictions, deterministic computability of longitudinal predictions, imposition of realistic costs and domain constraints, exposure to diverse contexts, statistically significant excess benefits relative to a priori benchmarks and Monte Carlo trials, insignificant decay of excess benefits, pathology detection and an extended real-time trial \"in the wild.\" We apply the protocol to a big data machine learning technique deployed since 2011 that finds persistent, exploitable opportunities in many of 41 segments of US financial markets, the existence of which opportunities substantially contradict the Efficient Market Hypothesis.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["ZZAlpha Ltd., Tucson, AZ, USA"], "authors": ["Kevin B.
