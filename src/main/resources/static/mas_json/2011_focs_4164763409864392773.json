{"title": "Mechanism Design with Set-Theoretic Beliefs.", "fields": ["solution concept", "common value auction", "stochastic game", "rationality", "mechanism design"], "abstract": "In settings of incomplete information, we put forward (1) a very conservative -- indeed, purely set-theoretic -- model of the beliefs (including totally wrong ones) that each player may have about the payoff types of his opponents, and (2) a new and robust solution concept, based on mutual belief of rationality, capable of leveraging such conservative beliefs. We exemplify the applicability of our new approach for single-good auctions, by showing that, under our solution concept, a normal-form, simple, and deterministic mechanism guarantees -- up to an arbitrarily small, additive constant -- a revenue benchmark that is always greater than or equal to the second-highest valuation, and sometimes much greater. By contrast, we also prove that the same benchmark cannot even be approximated within any positive factor, under classical solution concepts.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Jing Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Jing", "Silvio Micali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micali:Silvio"], "pages": 10}
