{"title": "Block A*: Database-Driven Search with Applications in Any-Angle Path-Planning.", "fields": ["grid", "motion planning", "search algorithm", "any angle path planning", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present three new ideas for grid-based path-planning algorithms that improve the search speed and quality of the paths found. First, we introduce a new type of database, the Local Distance Database (LDDB), that contains distances between boundary points of a local neighborhood. Second, an LDDB-based algorithm is introduced, called Block A*, that calculates the optimal path between start and goal locations given the local distances stored in the LDDB. Third, our experimental results for any-angle path planning in a wide variety of test domains, including real game maps, show that Block A* is faster than both A* and the previously best grid-based any-angle search algorithm, Theta*.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Peter Yap.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yap:Peter", "Neil Burch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burch:Neil", "Robert C.
