{"title": "Random Utility Theory for Social Choice.", "fields": ["statistical inference", "social choice theory", "special case", "parameterized complexity", "estimator"], "abstract": "Random utility theory models an agent's preferences on alternatives by drawing a real-valued score on each alternative (typically independently) from a parameterized distribution, and then ranking the alternatives according to scores. A special case that has received significant attention is the Plackett-Luce model, for which fast inference methods for maximum likelihood estimators are available. This paper develops conditions on general random utility models that enable fast inference within a Bayesian framework through MC-EM, providing concave log-likelihood functions and bounded sets of global maxima solutions. Results on both real-world and simulated data provide support for the scalability of the approach and capability for model selection among general random utility models including Plackett-Luce.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Hossein Azari Soufiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soufiani:Hossein_Azari", "David C.
