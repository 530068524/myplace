{"title": "TranStrL: An automatic need-to-translate string locator for software internationalization.", "fields": ["software prototyping", "source code", "java", "application software", "string"], "abstract": "Software internationalization is often necessary when distributing software applications to different regions around the world. In many cases, developers often do not internationalize a software application at the beginning of the development stage. To internationalize such an existing application, developers need to externalize some hard-coded constant strings to resource files, so that translators can easily translate the application to be in a local language without modifying its source code. Since not all the constant strings require externalization, locating those need-to-translate constant strings is a basic task that the developers must conduct. In this paper, we present TranStrL, an Eclipse plug-in tool that automatically locates need-to-translate constant strings in Java code. Our tool maintains a pre-collected list of API methods related to the Graphical User Interface (GUI), and then searches for need-to-translate strings in the source code starting from the invocations of these API methods using string-taint analysis.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "North Carolina State University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Xiaoyin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaoyin", "Lu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0023:Lu", "Tao Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Tao", "Hong Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Hong", "Jiasu Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jiasu"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
