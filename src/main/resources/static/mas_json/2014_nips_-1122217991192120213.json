Whereas the tremendous recent progress in object recognition tasks is due to the availability of large datasets like ImageNet and the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning high-level features, performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success. This may be because current deep features trained from ImageNet are not competitive enough for such tasks. Here, we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places with over 7 million labeled pictures of scenes. We propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. Using CNN, we learn deep features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets. A visualization of the CNN layers' responses allows us to show differences in the internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks.", "citation": "Citations (1,505)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Bolei Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Bolei", "\u00c0gata Lapedriza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lapedriza:=Agrave=gata", "Jianxiong Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Jianxiong", "Antonio Torralba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torralba_0001:Antonio", "Aude Oliva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliva:Aude"], "pages": 9}
