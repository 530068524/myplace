{"title": "Asymmetry in media spaces.", "fields": ["asymmetry", "computer supported cooperative work", "media space", "reciprocity", "technical report"], "abstract": "In any collaborative system, there are both symmetries and asymmetries present in the design of the technology and in the ways that technology is appropriated. Yet media space research tends to focus more on supporting and fostering the symmetries than the asymmetries. Throughout more than 20 years of media space research, the pursuit of increased symmetry, whether achieved through technical or social means, has been a recurrent theme. The research literature on the use of contemporary awareness systems, in contrast, displays little if any of this emphasis on symmetrical use; indeed, this body of research occasionally highlights the perceived value of asymmetry. In this paper, we unpack the different forms of asymmetry present in both media spaces and contemporary awareness systems. We argue that just as asymmetry has been demonstrated to have value in contemporary awareness systems, so might asymmetry have value in media spaces and in other CSCW systems, more generally. To illustrate, we present a media space that emphasizes and embodies multiple forms of asymmetry and does so in response to the needs of a particular work context.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Amy Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Amy", "Stephen Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Stephen", "Saul Greenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenberg:Saul", "Helen Ai He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Helen_Ai"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
