It uses a novel recursive neural network architecture for context propagation, referred to as rCPN. It first maps the local visual features into a semantic space followed by a bottom-up aggregation of local information into a global representation of the entire image. Then a top-down propagation of the aggregated information takes place that enhances the contextual information of each local feature. Therefore, the information from every location in the image is propagated to every other location. Experimental results on Stanford background and SIFT Flow datasets show that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches. It is also orders of magnitude faster than previous methods and takes only 0.07 seconds on a GPU for pixel-wise labeling of a 256 x 256 image starting from raw RGB pixel values, given the super-pixel mask that takes an additional 0.3 seconds using an off-the-shelf implementation.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories", "Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Abhishek Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Abhishek", "Oncel Tuzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuzel:Oncel", "Ming-Yu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ming=Yu"], "pages": 9}
