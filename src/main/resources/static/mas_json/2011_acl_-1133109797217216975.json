We combine several graph alignment features with lexical semantic similarity measures using machine learning techniques and show that the student answers can be more accurately graded than if the semantic measures were used in isolation. We also present a first attempt to align the dependency graphs of the student and the instructor answers in order to make use of a structural component in the automatic grading of student answers.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of North Texas", "Ohio University", "University of North Texas"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Michael Mohler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohler:Michael", "Razvan C.
