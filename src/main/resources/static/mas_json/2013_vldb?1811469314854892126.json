{"title": "Towards Elastic Stream Processing: Patterns and Infrastructure.", "fields": ["stream processing", "operator", "big data", "data stream mining", "batch processing"], "abstract": "Distributed, highly-parallel processing frameworks as Hadoop are deemed to be state-of-the-art for handling big data today. But they burden application developers with the task to manually implement program logic using lowlevel batch processing APIs. Thus, a movement can be observed that high-level languages are developed which allow to declaratively model dataflows that are automatically optimized and mapped to the batch-processing backends. However, most of these systems are based on programming models as MapReduce that provide elasticity and fault-tolerance in a natural manner since intermediate results are materialized and, therefore, processes can simply be restarted and scaled with partitioning input datasets. For continuous query processing on data streams, these concepts cannot be applied directly since it must be guaranteed that no data is lost when nodes fail. Usually, these long running queries contain operators that maintain state information which depends on the data that has already been processed and hence they cannot be restarted without information loss. This also is an issue when streaming tasks should be scaled. Therefore, integrating elasticity and fault-tolerance in this context is a challenging task which is subject of this paper. We show how common patterns from parallel and distributed algorithms can be applied to tackle these problems and how they are mapped to the Mesos cluster management system.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"], "authors": ["Kai-Uwe Sattler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sattler:Kai=Uwe", "Felix Beier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beier:Felix"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
