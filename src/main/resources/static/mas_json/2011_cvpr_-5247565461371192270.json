{"title": "A global optimization approach to robust multi-model fitting.", "fields": ["data modeling", "ranking", "noise measurement", "quadratic programming", "global optimization"], "abstract": "We present a novel Quadratic Program (QP) formulation for robust multi-model fitting of geometric structures in vision data. Our objective function enforces both the fidelity of a model to the data and the similarity between its associated inliers. Departing from most previous optimization-based approaches, the outcome of our method is a ranking of a given set of putative models, instead of a pre-specified number of \u201cgood\u201d candidates (or an attempt to decide the right number of models). This is particularly useful when the number of structures in the data is a priori unascertainable due to unknown intent and purposes. Another key advantage of our approach is that it operates in a unified optimization framework, and the standard QP form of our problem formulation permits globally convergent optimization techniques. We tested our method on several geometric multi-model fitting problems on both synthetic and real data. Experiments show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jin Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Jin", "Tat-Jun Chin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chin:Tat=Jun", "David Suter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suter:David"], "pages": 8}
