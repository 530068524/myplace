{"title": "Program Analysis with Dynamic Precision Adjustment.", "fields": ["cpachecker", "program analysis", "model checking", "client server model", "predicate abstraction"], "abstract": "We present and evaluate a framework and tool for combining multiple program analyses which allows the dynamic (on-line) adjustment of the precision of each analysis depending on the accumulated results. For example, the explicit tracking of the values of a variable may be switched off in favor of a predicate abstraction when and where the number of different variable values that have been encountered has exceeded a specified threshold. The method is evaluated on verifying the SSH client/server software and shows significant gains compared with predicate abstraction-based model checking.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Dirk Beyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beyer_0001:Dirk", "Thomas A.
