{"title": "Design Breakdowns: Designer-Developer Gaps in Representing and Interpreting Interactive Systems.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "computer science", "rework", "participatory design", "software"], "abstract": "Critical design is gaining momentum in interaction design, yet little CSCW research has focused on articulating the cooperative potentials of critical design artefacts. We address this gap by reflecting upon a design project aimed at overturning the prevailing narrative regarding dyslexia in Italy. The adversarial propositions embedded in our critical design artefacts challenged the description of dyslexia as a learning disorder putting forward the view of a learning difference. These artefacts demonstrated their capacity to bridge heterogeneous social worlds (those of teachers, children, and parents) into one cooperative entity and mobilise cooperative activism. The contribution to CSCW is two-fold. Firstly, we introduce the cooperative potentials of critical design artefacts; secondly, we propose critical design as a strategy for researchers engaging with cooperative activism.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Lincoln"], "authors": ["Nolwenn Maudet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maudet:Nolwenn", "Germ\u00e1n Leiva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leiva:Germ=aacute=n", "Michel Beaudouin-Lafon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beaudouin=Lafon:Michel", "Wendy E.
