Direct identification of mature miRNAs is infeasible due to their short lengths, and researchers instead aim at identifying precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Many of the known pre-miRNAs have distinctive stem-loop secondary structure, and structure-based filtering is usually the first step to predict the possibility of a given sequence being a pre-miRNA. To identify new pre-miRNAs that often have non-canonical structure, however, we need to consider additional features other than structure. To obtain such additional characteristics, existing computational methods rely on manual feature extraction, which inevitably limits the efficiency, robustness, and generalization of computational identification. To address the limitations of existing approaches, we propose a pre-miRNA identification method that incorporates (1) a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) for automated feature learning and classification, (2) multimodal architecture for seamless integration of prior knowledge (secondary structure), (3) an attention mechanism for improving long-term dependence modeling, and (4) an RNN-based class activation mapping for highlighting the learned representations that can contrast pre-miRNAs and non-pre-miRNAs. In our experiments with recent benchmarks, the proposed approach outperformed the compared state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of various performance metrics.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul Nation University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Seunghyun Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Seunghyun", "Seonwoo Min.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Min:Seonwoo", "Hyun-Soo Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Hyun=Soo", "Sungroh Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Sungroh"], "pages": 10}
