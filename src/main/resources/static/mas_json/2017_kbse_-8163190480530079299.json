Since prior studies have found developers expressing sentiments during various SE activities, there is a need for a customized sentiment analysis tool for the SE domain. On this goal, we manually labeled 2000 review comments to build a training dataset and used our dataset to evaluate seven popular sentiment analysis tools. The poor performances of the existing sentiment analysis tools motivated us to build SentiCR, a sentiment analysis tool especially designed for code review comments. We evaluated SentiCR using one hundred 10-fold cross-validations of eight supervised learning algorithms. We found a model, trained using the Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) algorithm, providing the highest mean accuracy (83%), the highest mean precision (67.8%), and the highest mean recall (58.4%) in identifying negative review comments.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology", "Southern Illinois University Carbondale", "Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology", "Southern Illinois University Carbondale"], "authors": ["Toufique Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Toufique", "Amiangshu Bosu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosu:Amiangshu", "Anindya Iqbal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iqbal:Anindya", "Shahram Rahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahimi:Shahram"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
