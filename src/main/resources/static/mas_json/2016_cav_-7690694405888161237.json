{"title": "Automated Circular Assume-Guarantee Reasoning with N-way Decomposition and Alphabet Refinement.", "fields": ["counterexample", "soundness", "circular reasoning", "premise", "alphabet"], "abstract": "In this work we develop an automated circular reasoning framework that is applicable to systems decomposed into multiple components. Our framework uses a family of circular assume-guarantee rules for which we give conditions for soundness and completeness. The assumptions used in the rules are initially approximate and their alphabets are automatically refined based on the counterexamples obtained from model checking the rule premises. A key feature of the framework is that the compositional rules that are used change dynamically with each iteration of the alphabet refinement, to only use assumptions that are relevant for the current alphabet, resulting in a smaller number of assumptions and smaller state spaces to analyze for each premise. Our preliminary evaluation of the proposed approach shows promising results compared to 2-way and monolithic verification.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Ames Research Center", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Karam Abd Elkader.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkader:Karam_Abd", "Orna Grumberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grumberg:Orna", "Corina S.
