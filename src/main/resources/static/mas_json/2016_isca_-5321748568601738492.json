{"title": "Using Multiple Input, Multiple Output Formal Control to Maximize Resource Efficiency in Architectures.", "fields": ["resource efficiency", "controller", "robust control", "mimo", "gain scheduling"], "abstract": "As processors seek more resource efficiency, they increasingly need to target multiple goals at the same time, such as a level of performance, power consumption, and average utilization. Robust control solutions cannot come from heuristic-based controllers or even from formal approaches that combine multiple single-parameter controllers. Such controllers may end-up working against each other. What is needed is control-theoretical MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) controllers, which actuate on multiple inputs and control multiple outputs in a coordinated manner.   In this paper, we use MIMO control-theory techniques to develop controllers to dynamically tune architectural parameters in processors. To our knowledge, this is the first work in this area. We discuss three ways in which a MIMO controller can be used. We develop an example of MIMO controller and show that it is substantially more effective than controllers based on heuristics or built by combining single-parameter formal controllers. The general approach discussed here is likely to be increasingly relevant as future processors become more resource-constrained and adaptive.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Qualcomm", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Raghavendra Pradyumna Pothukuchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pothukuchi:Raghavendra_Pradyumna", "Amin Ansari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ansari:Amin", "Petros G.
