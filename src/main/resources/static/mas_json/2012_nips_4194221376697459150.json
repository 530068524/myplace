{"title": "A quasi-Newton proximal splitting method.", "fields": ["operator", "convex analysis", "convex optimization", "duality", "monotonic function"], "abstract": "A new result in convex analysis on the calculation of proximity operators in certain scaled norms is derived. We describe efficient implementations of the proximity calculation for a useful class of functions; the implementations exploit the piece-wise linear nature of the dual problem. The second part of the paper applies the previous result to acceleration of convex minimization problems, and leads to an elegant quasi-Newton method. The optimization method compares favorably against state-of-the-art alternatives. The algorithm has extensive applications including signal processing, sparse recovery and machine learning and classification.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University", "\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Caen"], "authors": ["Stephen Becker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Becker:Stephen", "Mohamed-Jalal Fadili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fadili:Mohamed=Jalal"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
