{"title": "Item sampling for information architecture.", "fields": ["data mining", "sampling", "computer science", "card sorting", "information architecture"], "abstract": "When creating a taxonomy for information architecture, practitioners or design participants typically work with a sample of content items to form categories that allow users to successfully navigate to desired information, commands, or items. In order to examine how sample selection affects the coverage of the desired taxonomy, computer simulations were conducted that models the process of sample selection. The simulations reveal how the number of categories, the distribution of items in the taxonomy and the method of selection affect the coverage of a sample at various sizes.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["DePaul University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Craig S.
