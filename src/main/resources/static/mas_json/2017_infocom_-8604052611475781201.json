While previous works on network recovery require complete knowledge of damage extent, we address the problem of damage assessment and critical service restoration in a joint manner. We propose a polynomial algorithm called Centrality based Damage Assessment and Recovery (CeDAR) which performs a joint activity of failure monitoring and restoration of network components. CeDAR works under limited availability of recovery resources and optimizes service recovery over time. We modified two existing approaches to the problem of network recovery to make them also able to exploit incremental knowledge of the failure extent. Through simulations we show that CeDAR outperforms the previous approaches in terms of recovery resource utilization and accumulative flow over time of the critical services.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Stefano Ciavarella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciavarella:Stefano", "Novella Bartolini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartolini:Novella", "Hana Khamfroush.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khamfroush:Hana", "Thomas F.
