This is more difficult than for single systems because an SPL with  n  features yields up to 2  n   individual systems to verify. As each individual verification suffers from state explosion, it is crucial to propose efficient formalisms and heuristics.   We recently proposed  featured transition systems  (FTS), a compact representation for SPL behaviour, and defined algorithms for model checking FTS against linear temporal properties. Although they showed to outperform individual system verifications, they still face a state explosion problem as they enumerate and visit system states one by one.   In this paper, we tackle this latter problem by using symbolic representations of the state space. This lead us to consider computation tree logic (CTL) which is supported by the industry-strength symbolic model checker NuSMV. We first lay the foundations for symbolic SPL model checking by defining a feature-oriented version of CTL and its dedicated algorithms. We then describe an implementation that adapts the NuSMV language and tool infrastructure. Finally, we propose theoretical and empirical evaluations of our results. The benchmarks show that for certain properties, our algorithm is over a hundred times faster than model checking each system with the standard algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (214)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "University of Li\u00e8ge"], "authors": ["Andreas Classen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Classen:Andreas", "Patrick Heymans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heymans:Patrick", "Pierre-Yves Schobbens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schobbens:Pierre=Yves", "Axel Legay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Legay:Axel"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
