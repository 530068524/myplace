An acyclic instance admits a unique stable configuration, which can reveal the performance of the system. In this paper, we give the statistical properties of the stable configuration for three classes of acyclic preferences: node-based preferences, distance-based preferences, and random acyclic systems. Using random overlay graphs, we prove by means of a mean-field assumption and a fluid-limit technique that these systems have an asymptotically continuous independent rank distribution for a proper scaling, and the analytical solution is compared to simulations. These results provide a theoretical ground for validating the performance of bandwidth-based or proximity-based unstructured systems.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Orange S.A.", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Fabien Mathieu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathieu:Fabien", "Gheorghe Postelnicu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Postelnicu:Gheorghe", "Julien Reynier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reynier:Julien"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
