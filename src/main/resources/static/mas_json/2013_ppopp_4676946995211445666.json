For such programs our analysis can certify whenever a program is deterministic or flags races.   Our key contributions are (i) adaptation of array dataflow analysis from the polyhedral model to programs with finish/async parallelism, and (ii) use of the array dataflow analysis result to certify determinacy. We distinguish our work from previous approaches by combining the precise statement instance-wise and array element-wise analysis capability of the polyhedral model with finish/async programs that are more expressive than doall parallelism commonly considered in the polyhedral literature. We show that our approach is exact (no false negative/positives) and more precise than previous approaches, but is limited to programs that fit the polyhedral model.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Colorado State University", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "Colorado State University", "IBM"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Tomofumi Yuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuki:Tomofumi", "Paul Feautrier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feautrier:Paul", "Sanjay V.
