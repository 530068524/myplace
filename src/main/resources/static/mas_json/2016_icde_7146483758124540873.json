{"title": "The CRO kernel: Using Concomitant Rank Order hashes for sparse high dimensional randomized feature maps.", "fields": ["polynomial kernel", "variable kernel density estimation", "string kernel", "tree kernel", "kernel embedding of distributions"], "abstract": "Kernel methods have been shown to be effective for many machine learning tasks such as classification, clustering and regression. In particular, support vector machines with the RBF kernel have proved to be powerful classification tools. The standard way to apply kernel methods is to use the \u2018kernel trick\u2019, where the inner product of the vectors in the feature space is computed via the kernel function. Using the kernel trick for SVMs, however, leads to training that is quadratic in the number of input vectors and classification that is linear with the number of support vectors. We introduce a new kernel, the CRO (Concomitant Rank Order) kernel that approximates the RBF kernel for unit length input vectors. We also introduce a new randomized feature map, based on concomitant rank order hashing, that produces sparse, high dimensional feature vectors whose inner product asymptotically equals the CRO kernel. Using the Hadamard transform for computing the CRO hashes ensures that the cost of computing feature vectors is very low. Thus, for unit length input vectors, we get the accuracy of the RBF kernel with the efficiency of a sparse high dimensional linear kernel. We show the efficacy of our approach using a number of standard datasets.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Kave Eshghi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eshghi:Kave", "Mehran Kafai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kafai:Mehran"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
