{"title": "Globally optimal pixel labeling algorithms for tree metrics.", "fields": ["gomory hu tree", "segment tree", "cut", "interval tree", "search tree"], "abstract": "We consider pixel labeling problems where the label set forms a tree, and where the observations are also labels. Such problems arise in feature-space analysis with a very large label set, for instance in color image segmentation. In this case a tree of labels can be constructed via hierarchical clustering of the observations. This leads to an obvious distance function between two labels, namely their distance within the tree; such tree metrics have been extensively studied outside of computer vision [14]. We provide fast algorithms that use graph cuts to exactly minimize the energy function for pixel labeling problems with tree metrics. Our work substantially improves a facility location algorithm of Kolen [18], which is impractical for large label sets L since it requires O(|L|) min cuts on large graphs. Our main technical contribution is a new ordering of swap moves that reduces the running time to the equivalent of O(log |L|) min cuts; as a result, we can handle realistic-sized color images in a few seconds.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Pedro F.
