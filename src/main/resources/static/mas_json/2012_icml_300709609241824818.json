{"title": "A Complete Analysis of the l_1, p Group-Lasso.", "fields": ["data set", "active set method", "synthetic data", "p group", "lasso"], "abstract": "The Group-Lasso is a well-known tool for joint regularization in machine learning methods. While the \u20181;2 and the \u20181;1 version have been studied in detail and ecient algorithms exist, there are still open questions regarding other \u20181;p variants. We characterize conditions for solutions of the \u20181;p GroupLasso for all p-norms with 1 p 1 , and we present a unied active set algorithm. For all p-norms, a highly ecient projected gradient algorithm is presented. This new algorithm enables us to compare the prediction performance of many variants of the GroupLasso in a multi-task learning setting, where the aim is to solve many learning problems in parallel which are coupled via the GroupLasso constraint. We conduct large-scale experiments on synthetic data and on two realworld data sets. In accordance with theoretical characterizations of the dierent norms we observe that the weak-coupling norms withp between 1.5 and 2 consistently outperform the strong-coupling norms with p 2.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Basel", "University of Basel"], "authors": ["Julia E.
