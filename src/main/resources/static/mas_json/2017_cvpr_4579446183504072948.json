{"title": "Simple Does It: Weakly Supervised Instance and Semantic Segmentation.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "segmentation", "minimum bounding box", "scale space segmentation", "labelling"], "abstract": "Semantic labelling and instance segmentation are two tasks that require particularly costly annotations. Starting from weak supervision in the form of bounding box detection annotations, we propose a new approach that does not require modification of the segmentation training procedure. We show that when carefully designing the input labels from given bounding boxes, even a single round of training is enough to improve over previously reported weakly supervised results. Overall, our weak supervision approach reaches ~95% of the quality of the fully supervised model, both for semantic labelling and instance segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "External Organizations"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anna Khoreva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoreva:Anna", "Rodrigo Benenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benenson:Rodrigo", "Jan Hendrik Hosang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosang:Jan_Hendrik", "Matthias Hein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hein_0001:Matthias", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 10}
