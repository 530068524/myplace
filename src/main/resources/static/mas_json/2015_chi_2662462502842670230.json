{"title": "Exploring Cyberbullying and Other Toxic Behavior in Team Competition Online Games.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "knowledge management", "computer science"], "abstract": "In this work we explore cyberbullying and other toxic behavior in team competition online games. Using a dataset of over 10 million player reports on 1.46 million toxic players along with corresponding crowdsourced decisions, we test several hypotheses drawn from theories explaining toxic behavior. Besides providing large-scale, empirical based understanding of toxic behavior, our work can be used as a basis for building systems to detect, prevent, and counter-act toxic behavior.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Telef\u00f3nica", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Haewoon Kwak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwak:Haewoon", "Jeremy Blackburn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blackburn:Jeremy", "Seungyeop Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Seungyeop"], "pages": 10}
