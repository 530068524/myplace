{"title": "Supervised Word Mover's Distance.", "fields": ["word embedding", "k nearest neighbors algorithm", "document classification", "weight", "affine transformation"], "abstract": "Recently, a new document metric called the word mover's distance (WMD) has been proposed with unprecedented results on kNN-based document classification. The WMD elevates high-quality word embeddings to a document metric by formulating the distance between two documents as an optimal transport problem between the embedded words. However, the document distances are entirely un-supervised and lack a mechanism to incorporate supervision when available. In this paper we propose an efficient technique to learn a supervised metric, which we call the Supervised-WMD (S-WMD) metric. The supervised training minimizes the stochastic leave-one-out nearest neighbor classification error on a per-document level by updating an affine transformation of the underlying word embedding space and a word-imporance weight vector. As the gradient of the original WMD distance would result in an inefficient nested optimization problem, we provide an arbitrarily close approximation that results in a practical and efficient update rule. We evaluate S-WMD on eight real-world text classification tasks on which it consistently outperforms almost all of our 26 competitive baselines.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "University of Warwick", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Gao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Gao", "Chuan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Chuan", "Matt J.
