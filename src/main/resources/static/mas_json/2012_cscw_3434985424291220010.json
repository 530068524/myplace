{"title": "Inflo: collaborative reasoning via open calculation graphs.", "fields": ["dataflow", "graph", "argument", "computation", "reuse"], "abstract": "Inflo  is a web tool that introduces new ways to collaboratively construct and deconstruct logical arguments drawn as visual dataflow graphs.  Inflo  graphs are dynamic: nodes are logical propositions that can contain computations based on other nodes.  Inflo  nodes and graphs have URLs, permitting sharing via blogs, e-mails, papers, etc. People can collaboratively construct, refine, and adapt/reuse arguments by making changes to shared nodes. Combining community-curated nodes and using  Inflo's  nodes for computation, back-of-the-envelope calculations can rapidly be made.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Jonathan Lung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lung:Jonathan", "Steve M.
