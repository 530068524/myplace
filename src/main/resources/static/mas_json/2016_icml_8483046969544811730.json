{"title": "Isotonic Hawkes Processes.", "fields": ["iterative method", "rendering", "mathematical finance", "social network", "isotonic"], "abstract": "Hawkes processes are powerful tools for modeling the mutual-excitation phenomena commonly observed in event data from a variety of domains, such as social networks, quantitative finance and healthcare records. The intensity function of a Hawkes process is typically assumed to be linear in the sum of triggering kernels, rendering it inadequate to capture nonlinear effects present in real-world data. To address this shortcoming, we propose an Isotonic-Hawkes process whose intensity function is modulated by an additional nonlinear link function. We also developed a novel iterative algorithm which learns both the nonlinear link function and other parameters provably. We showed that Isotonic-Hawkes processes can fit a variety of nonlinear patterns which cannot be captured by conventional Hawkes processes, and achieve superior empirical performance in real world applications.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yichen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yichen", "Bo Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0002:Bo", "Nan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Nan", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le"], "pages": 9}
