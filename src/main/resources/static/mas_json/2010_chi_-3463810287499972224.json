In this paper, we study how different output configurations (audio, visual and audio-visual) of a GPS system affect driving behaviour and performance. We conducted field experiments in real traffic with 30 subjects. Our results illustrated that visual output not only causes a substantial amount of eye glances, but also led to a decrease in driving performance. Adding audio output decreased the number of eye glances, but we found no significant effects on driving performance. Although the audio configuration implied much fewer eye glances and improved driving performance, several participants expressed preference for the audio/visual output.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University"], "authors": ["Brit Susan Jensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jensen:Brit_Susan", "Mikael B.
