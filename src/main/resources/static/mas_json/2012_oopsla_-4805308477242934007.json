In fact, a vast category of concurrent programs are scheduler-oblivious: their execution is deterministic, regardless of the scheduling behavior. We present and formally prove a fundamental observation of the privatizability property for scheduler-oblivious programs, that paves the theoretical foundation for privatizing shared data accesses on a path segment. With privatization, the non-deterministic thread interleavings on the privatized accesses are isolated and as the consequence many concurrency problems are alleviated. We further present a path and context sensitive privatization algorithm that safely privatizes the program without introducing any additional program behavior. Our evaluation results show that the privatization opportunity pervasively exists in real world large complex concurrent systems. Through privatization, several real concurrency bugs are fixed and notable performance improvements are also achieved on benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Jeff Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Jeff", "Charles Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Charles"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2012", "pages": 16}
