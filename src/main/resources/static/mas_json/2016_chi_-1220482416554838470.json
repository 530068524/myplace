{"title": "Why Design Method Development is Not Always Carried Out as User-Centered Design.", "fields": ["interaction design", "design brief", "single subject design", "experience design", "user centered design"], "abstract": "In a series of interviews and observations conducted over the past two years, we examined how designers have created, adopted, and evolved design methods into practice. These studies have led us to question the processes used and assumptions held by those who have been involved in developing new design methods. Our studies have shown that even though user-centered design is advocated by most researchers and practitioners, when it comes to their own way of developing design methods for others, it is not done using a user-centered approach. However, we found interesting differences among the three categories of interviewees; practitioners, researchers and practitioner/researchers.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gary Dickson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dickson:Gary", "Erik Stolterman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stolterman:Erik"], "pages": 5}
