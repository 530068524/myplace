A speaker model encodes personas in distributed embeddings that capture individual characteristics such as background information and speaking style. A dyadic speaker-addressee model captures properties of interactions between two interlocutors. Our models yield qualitative performance improvements in both perplexity and BLEU scores over baseline sequence-to-sequence models, with similar gains in speaker consistency as measured by human judges.", "citation": "Citations (204)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jiwei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiwei", "Michel Galley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galley:Michel", "Chris Brockett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brockett:Chris", "Georgios P.
