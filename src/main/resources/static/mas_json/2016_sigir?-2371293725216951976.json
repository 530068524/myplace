{"title": "SimCC-AT: A Method to Compute Similarity of Scientific Papers with Automatic Parameter Tuning.", "fields": ["weighting", "exploit", "data mining", "computation", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose SimCC-AT (similarity based on content and citations with automatic parameter tuning) to compute the similarity of scientific papers. As in SimCC, the state-of-the-art method, we exploit a notion of a contribution score in similarity computation. SimCC-AT utilizes an automatic weighting scheme based on SVMrank and thus requires only a smaller number of experiments for parameter tuning than SimCC. Furthermore, our experimental results with a real-world dataset show that the accuracy of SimCC-AT is dramatically higher than that of other existing methods and is comparable to that of SimCC.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hanyang University", "Hanyang University"], "authors": ["Masoud Reyhani Hamedani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamedani:Masoud_Reyhani", "Sang-Wook Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sang=Wook"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
