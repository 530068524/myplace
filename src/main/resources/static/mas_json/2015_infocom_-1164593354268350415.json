Many existing works have analyzed the capacity of hybrid wireless networks. By assuming the uniform traffic model that a source node would select a random node as the destination, the network capacity is a function of number of nodes and number of base stations. Nevertheless, the real network traffic pattern is related to the social behaviors of users. In this work, we study the capacity of hybrid wireless networks with the social traffic model under the L-maximum-hop routing policy. If two nodes are within L hops away, packets will be transmitted in the ad hoc mode; otherwise, packets are transmitted through the base stations. To our best knowledge, we are the first to study this problem and develop the capacity as a function of number of nodes, number of stations, traffic model parameters, and L.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Xidian University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Xidian University", "Xidian University", "University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Ronghui Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Ronghui", "Yu Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Yu", "Jiandong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Jiandong", "Min Sheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheng:Min", "King-Shan Lui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lui:King=Shan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
