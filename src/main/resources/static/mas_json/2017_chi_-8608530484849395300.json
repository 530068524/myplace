{"title": "Making Space for the Quality Care: Opportunities for Technology in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia.", "fields": ["insomnia", "formative assessment", "cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia", "leverage", "workflow"], "abstract": "Insomnia can drastically affect individuals' overall well-being and work performance, with substantial costs to society and industry. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a psychotherapeutic treatment, which requires patients to track sleep and share the data with CBT-I clinicians. However, the number of specialists who can provide CBT-I limits the number of patients who can receive it. In this paper, we aim to identify opportunities to leverage technology to assist clinicians in delivering quality and effective CBT-I services to broader populations. Toward this goal, we conducted formative studies, including 11 CBT-I clinic observations and 17 semi-structured interviews, to understand the current workflow of CBT-I and associated challenges. We discuss how technology can assist clinicians and patients throughout the various steps of CBT-I workflow while addressing some of the identified challenges, and more broadly, how technology can make space for clinicians and patients to build quality therapeutic relationships.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Haining Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Haining", "Yuhan Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Yuhan", "Eun Kyoung Choe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choe:Eun_Kyoung"], "pages": 14}
