All the results involve novel mathematical approaches to the metric learning problem, and also shed new light on the special case of ordinal embedding (aka non-metric multidimensional scaling).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Michigan", "University of W ... consion-Madison"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Blake Mason.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mason:Blake", "Lalit Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Lalit", "Robert D.
