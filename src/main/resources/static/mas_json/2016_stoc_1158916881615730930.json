The problem is to maintain a multiset of intervals  I  over [0,  n ] with integer coordinates, supporting the following operations: 1)  insert(a, b) , add an interval [ a ,  b ] to  I , provided that  a  and  b  are integers in [0,  n ]; 2)  delete(a, b) , delete an (existing) interval [ a ,  b ] from  I ; 3)  query() , return the total length of the union of all intervals in  I .   It is related to the two-dimensional case of Klee\u2019s measure problem. We prove that there is a distribution over sequences of operations with  O ( n ) insertions and deletions, and  O ( n  0.01 ) queries, for which any data structure with any constant error probability requires \u03a9( n log n ) time in expectation. Interestingly, we use the sparse set disjointness protocol of Hastad and Wigderson to speed up a reduction from a new kind of nondeterministic communication games, for which we prove lower bounds.   For applications, we prove lower bounds for several dynamic graph problems by reducing them from dynamic interval union.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Huacheng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Huacheng"], "pages": 13}
