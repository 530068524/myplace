Our approach first inverts the linear transformation from latent features to brain responses with maximum a posteriori estimation and then inverts the nonlinear transformation from perceived stimuli to latent features with adversarial training of convolutional neural networks. We test our approach with a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment and show that it can generate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perceived faces from brain activations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yagmur G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fct\u00fcrk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=uuml==ccedil=l=uuml=t=uuml=rk:Yagmur", "Umut G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=uuml==ccedil=l=uuml=:Umut", "Katja Seeliger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seeliger:Katja", "Sander Bosch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosch:Sander", "Rob van Lier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lier:Rob_van", "Marcel A.
