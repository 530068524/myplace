Property verification is achieved by translation into boolean logic and the application of SAT-solvers. bounded satisfiability checking (BSC) adopts a similar approach, but both the system and the properties are modeled with temporal logic formulae, without an underlying operational model. Hence, BSC supports a higher-level, descriptive approach to system specification and analysis. We compare the performance of BMC and BSC over a set of case studies, using the Zot tool to translate automata and temporal logic formulae into boolean logic. We also propose a method to check whether an operational model is a correct implementation (refinement) of a temporal logic model, and assess its effectiveness on the same set of case studies. Our experimental results show the feasibility of BSC and refinement checking, with modest performance loss w.r.t.
