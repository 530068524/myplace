A promising approach to increase the RAN capacity and simultaneously reduce its energy consumption is represented by the opportunistic utilization of third party Wi-Fi access devices. In order to foster the utilization of unexploited Internet connections, we propose a new and open market, where a mobile operator can lease the bandwidth made available by third parties (residential users or private companies) through their access points to increase the network capacity and save large amounts of energy. We formulate the offloading problem as a reverse auction considering the most general case of partial covering of the traffic to be offloaded. We discuss the conditions (i) to offload the maximum amount of data traffic according to the capacity of third party access devices, (ii) to foster the participation of access point owners (individual rationality), and (iii) to prevent market manipulation (incentive compatibility). Finally, we propose a greedy algorithm that solves the offloading problem in polynomial time, even for large-size network scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Bergamo", "LRI, Univ.
