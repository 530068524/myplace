Our model is based on a convolutional neural network coupled with a novel temporal pooling layer. The temporal pooling layer relies on an inner-optimization problem to efficiently encode temporal semantics over arbitrarily long video clips into a fixed-length vector representation. Importantly, the representation and classification parameters of our model can be estimated jointly in an end-to-end manner by formulating learning as a bilevel optimization problem. Furthermore, the model can make use of any existing convolutional neural network architecture (e.g., AlexNet or VGG) without modification or introduction of additional parameters. We demonstrate our approach on action and activity recognition tasks.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Basura Fernando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fernando:Basura", "Stephen Gould.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gould:Stephen"], "pages": 10}
