Capitalizing on the existing sparsity regularized feature selection methods, we propose a general sparsity feature selection (GSR-FS) algorithm that optimizes a l 2, r   (0 <\u00a0 r   \u2264  2) based loss function with a l 2, p  -norm (0 <  p   \u2264  2) sparse regularization. The l 2, r   - norm (0 < \ud835\udc5f \u2264 2) based loss function brings flexibility to balance data-fitting and robustness to outliers by tuning its parameter, and the l 2, p  -norm (0 <  p   \u2264  1) based regularization function is able to boost the sparsity for feature selection. To solve the optimization problem with multiple non-smooth and non-convex functions when , we develop an efficient solver under the general umbrella of Iterative Reweighted Least Square (IRLS) algorithms. Our algorithm has been proved to converge with a theoretical convergence order of min(2 \u2013  r,  2 \u2013  p ) at least . The experimental results have demonstrated that our method could achieve competitive feature selection performance on publicly available datasets compared with state-of-the-art feature selection methods, with reduced computational cost.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Hanyang Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Hanyang", "Yong Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Yong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
