In these schemes, we have m the number of equations, n the number of variables, L the number of steps/layers, r the number of equations/variables per step, and q the size of the underlying field. We present two attacks on the STS class by exploiting the chain of the kernels of the private key polynomials. The first attack is an inversion attack which computes the message/signature for given ciphertext/message in O(mn3Lqr + n2Lrqr), the second is a structural attack which recovers an equivalent version of the secret key in O(mn3Lqr + mn4) operations. Since the legitimate user has workload qr for decrypting/computing a signature, the attacks presented in this paper are very efficient. As an application, we show that two special instances of STS, namely RSE(2)PKC and RSSE(2)PKC, recently proposed by Kasahara and Sakai, are insecure.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Technicolor", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "Isfahan University of Technology", "Isfahan University of Technology", "Isfahan University of Technology", "Samsung", "Korea University", "Dept. of Appl.  ... hengzhou, China", "Dept. of Appl.  ... hengzhou, China"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Marc Joye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joye:Marc", "Beno\u00eet Libert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Libert:Beno=icirc=t"], "pages": 17}
