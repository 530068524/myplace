We analyze a modified version of a k-nearest neighbor based algorithm recently proposed by Chaudhuri and Dasgupta (2010). The main results of this paper show that under mild assumptions on f and M, we obtain rates of convergence that depend on d only but not on the ambient dimension D. Finally, we sketch a construction of a sample complexity lower bound instance for a natural class of manifold oblivious clustering algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Sivaraman Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Sivaraman", "Srivatsan Narayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanan:Srivatsan", "Alessandro Rinaldo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rinaldo:Alessandro", "Aarti Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Aarti", "Larry A.
