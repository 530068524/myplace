{"title": "Multipath de-fragmentation: Achieving better spectral efficiency in elastic optical path networks.", "fields": ["spectral efficiency", "integer programming", "multipath routing", "optical path", "multipath propagation"], "abstract": "In elastic optical networks, the spectrum consecutive and continuous constraints may cause the so-called spectrum fragmentation issue, degrading spectrum utilization, which is especially critical under dynamic traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel multipath de-fragmentation method which aggregates spectrum fragments instead of reconfiguring existing spectrum paths. We propose an optimization model based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and heuristic algorithms and discuss the practical feasibility of the proposed method. We show that multipath routing is an effective de-fragmentation method, as it improves spectral efficiency and reduces blocking under dynamic traffic conditions. We also show that the differential delay issue does not present an obstacle to the application of multipath de-fragmentation in elastic optical networks.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Indian Institutes of Technology", "Tech.
