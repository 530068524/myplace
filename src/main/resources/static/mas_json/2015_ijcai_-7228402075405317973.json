{"title": "On the Consistency of AUC Pairwise Optimization.", "fields": ["pairwise comparison", "equivalence", "univariate", "regret", "exponential function"], "abstract": "AUC (Area Under ROC Curve) has been an important criterion widely used in diverse learning tasks. To optimize AUC, many learning approaches have been developed, most working with pairwise surrogate losses. Thus, it is important to study the AUC consistency based on minimizing pairwise surrogate losses. In this paper, we introduce the generalized calibration for AUC optimization, and prove that it is a necessary condition for AUC consistency. We then provide a sufficient condition for AUC consistency, and show its usefulness in studying the consistency of various surrogate losses, as well as the invention of new consistent losses. We further derive regret bounds for exponential and logistic losses, and present regret bounds for more general surrogate losses in the realizable setting. Finally, we prove regret bounds that disclose the equivalence between the pairwise exponential loss of AUC and univariate exponential loss of accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Wei Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0008:Wei", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
