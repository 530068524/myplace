In this paper, we present a novel database, RAF-DB, which contains about 30000 facial images from thousands of individuals. Each image has been individually labeled about 40 times, then EM algorithm was used to filter out unreliable labels. Crowdsourcing reveals that real-world faces often express compound emotions, or even mixture ones. For all we know, RAF-DB is the first database that contains compound expressions in the wild. Our cross-database study shows that the action units of basic emotions in RAF-DB are much more diverse than, or even deviate from, those of lab-controlled ones. To address this problem, we propose a new DLP-CNN (Deep Locality-Preserving CNN) method, which aims to enhance the discriminative power of deep features by preserving the locality closeness while maximizing the inter-class scatters. The benchmark experiments on the 7-class basic expressions and 11-class compound expressions, as well as the additional experiments on SFEW and CK+ databases, show that the proposed DLP-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art handcrafted features and deep learning based methods for the expression recognition in the wild.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": [], "authors": ["Shan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Shan", "Weihong Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Weihong", "Junping Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Junping"], "conf": "cvpr", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
