Is it possible to model these patterns and tell if a user is a human or a bot based only on the timing of their postings? Social media services allow users to make postings, generating large datasets of human activity time-stamps. In this paper we analyze time-stamp data from social media services and find that the distribution of postings inter-arrival times (IAT) is characterized by four patterns: (i) positive correlation between consecutive IATs, (ii) heavy tails, (iii) periodic spikes and (iv) bimodal distribution. Based on our findings, we propose Rest-Sleep-and-Comment (RSC), a generative model that is able to match all four discovered patterns. We demonstrate the utility of RSC by showing that it can accurately fit real time-stamp data from Reddit and Twitter. We also show that RSC can be used to spot outliers and detect users with non-human behavior, such as bots. We validate RSC using real data consisting of over 35 million postings from Twitter and Reddit. RSC consistently provides a better fit to real data and clearly outperform existing models for human dynamics. RSC was also able to detect bots with a precision higher than 94%.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "University of Tsukuba", "University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Alceu Ferraz Costa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costa:Alceu_Ferraz", "Yuto Yamaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamaguchi:Yuto", "Agma Juci Machado Traina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traina:Agma_Juci_Machado", "Caetano Traina Jr......http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traina_Jr=:Caetano", "Christos Faloutsos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faloutsos:Christos"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
