Although some works have been made in recent years, especially for improving the coding efficiency, most reported WZ codecs have high time delay in the decoder, which hinders its practical values for applications with critical timing constraint. In this paper, a fully parallelized sum-product algorithm (SPA) for low density parity check accumulate (LDPCA) codes is proposed and realized through Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) based on General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU). Simulation results show that, through our work, QCIF (surveillance) videos can be decoded in real-time with extremely high quality and without rate-distortion (RD) performance loss.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Tse-Chung Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Tse=Chung", "Yun-Chung Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yun=Chung", "Ja-Ling Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ja=Ling"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
