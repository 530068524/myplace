{"title": "Fast, Flexible, and Minimal CTL Synthesis via SMT.", "fields": ["ctl", "model checking", "modulo", "monotonic function", "solver"], "abstract": "CTL synthesis [8] is a long-standing problem with applications to synthesising synchronization protocols and concurrent programs. We show how to formulate CTL model checking in terms of \u201cmonotonic theories\u201d, enabling us to use the SAT Modulo Monotonic Theories (SMMT) [5] framework to build an efficient SAT-modulo-CTL solver. This yields a powerful procedure for CTL synthesis, which is not only faster than previous techniques from the literature, but also scales to larger and more difficult formulas. Additionally, because it is a constraint-based approach, it can be easily extended with further constraints to guide the synthesis. Moreover, our approach is efficient at producing minimal Kripke structures on common CTL synthesis benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Tobias Klenze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klenze:Tobias", "Sam Bayless.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bayless:Sam", "Alan J.
