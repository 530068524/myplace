{"title": "Framework and Schema for Semantic Web Knowledge Bases.", "fields": ["semantic web stack", "semantic web", "rdf", "social semantic web", "semantic analytics"], "abstract": "There is a growing need for scalable semantic web repositories which support inference and provide efficient queries.  There is also a growing interest in representing uncertain knowledge in semantic web datasets and ontologies.  In this paper, I present a bit vector schema specifically designed for RDF (Resource Description Framework) datasets. I propose a system for  materializing and storing inferred knowledge using this schema.  I show experimental results that demonstrate that this solution simplifies inference queries and drastically improves results.  I also propose and describe a solution for materializing and persisting uncertain information and probabilities.  Thresholds and bit vectors are used to provide efficient query access to this uncertain knowledge.  My goal is to provide a semantic web repository that supports knowledge inference, uncertainty reasoning, and Bayesian networks, without sacrificing performance or scalability.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["James P.
