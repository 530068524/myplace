{"title": "Diverse Replication for Single-Machine Byzantine-Fault Tolerance.", "fields": ["software", "byzantine fault tolerance", "virtualization", "computation", "server"], "abstract": "New single-machine environments are emerging from abundant computation available through multiple cores and secure virtualization. In this paper, we describe the research challenges and opportunities around diversified replication as a method to increase the Byzantine-fault tolerance (BFT) of single-machine servers to software attacks or errors. We then discuss the design space of BFT protocols enabled by these new environments.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Institute of Company Secretaries of India", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Byung-Gon Chun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chun:Byung=Gon", "Petros Maniatis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maniatis:Petros", "Scott Shenker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shenker:Scott"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
