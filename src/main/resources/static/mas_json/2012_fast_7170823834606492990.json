{"title": "Adding advanced storage controller functionality via low-overhead virtualization.", "fields": ["virtualization", "hypervisor", "storage virtualization", "full virtualization", "converged storage"], "abstract": "Historically, storage controllers have been extended by integrating new code, e.g., file serving, database processing, deduplication, etc., into an existing base. This integration leads to complexity, co-dependency and instability of both the original and new functions. Hypervisors are a known mechanism to isolate different functions. However, to enable extending a storage controller by providing new functions in a virtual machine (VM), the virtualization overhead must be negligible, which is not the case in a straightforward implementation. This paper demonstrates a set of mechanisms and techniques that achieve near zero runtime performance overhead for using virtualization in the context of a storage system.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Muli Ben-Yehuda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Yehuda:Muli", "Michael Factor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Factor:Michael", "Eran Rom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rom:Eran", "Avishay Traeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traeger:Avishay", "Eran Borovik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borovik:Eran", "Ben-Ami Yassour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yassour:Ben=Ami"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2012", "pages": 1}
