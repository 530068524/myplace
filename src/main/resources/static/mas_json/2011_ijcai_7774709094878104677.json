To meet the needs of future missions and increase their scientific return, future space systems will require an increased level of autonomy on-board. In this work, we propose a comprehensive approach to on-board autonomy relying on model-based reasoning, and encompassing many important reasoning capabilities such as plan generation, validation, execution and monitoring, FDIR, and run-time diagnosis. The controlled platform is represented symbolically, and the reasoning capabilities are seen as symbolic manipulation of such formal model. We have developed a prototype of our framework, implemented within an on-board Autonomous Reasoning Engine. We have evaluated our approach on two case-studies inspired by real-world, ongoing projects, and characterized it in terms of reliability, availability and performance.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Marco Bozzano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bozzano:Marco", "Alessandro Cimatti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cimatti:Alessandro", "Marco Roveri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roveri:Marco", "Andrei Tchaltsev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tchaltsev:Andrei"], "pages": 6}
