{"title": "Waveform Driven Plasticity in BiFeO3 Memristive Devices: Model and Implementation.", "fields": ["waveform", "bridging", "memristor", "neuromorphic engineering", "overlay"], "abstract": "Memristive devices have recently been proposed as efficient implementations of plastic synapses in neuromorphic systems. The plasticity in these memristive devices, i.e. their resistance change, is defined by the applied waveforms. This behavior resembles biological synapses, whose plasticity is also triggered by mechanisms that are determined by local waveforms. However, learning in memristive devices has so far been approached mostly on a pragmatic technological level. The focus seems to be on finding any waveform that achieves spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), without regard to the biological veracity of said waveforms or to further important forms of plasticity. Bridging this gap, we make use of a plasticity model driven by neuron waveforms that explains a large number of experimental observations and adapt it to the characteristics of the recently introduced BiFeO3 memristive material. Based on this approach, we show STDP for the first time for this material, with learning window replication superior to previous memristor-based STDP implementations. We also demonstrate in measurements that it is possible to overlay short and long term plasticity at a memristive device in the form of the well-known triplet plasticity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementations of triplet plasticity on any physical memristive device.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Zentrum Mikroel ... esden, Germany", "Zentrum Mikroel ... esden, Germany"], "authors": ["Christian Mayr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayr:Christian", "Paul St\u00e4rke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/St=auml=rke:Paul", "Johannes Partzsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Partzsch:Johannes", "Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fcffny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=ffny:Ren=eacute=", "Love Cederstroem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cederstroem:Love", "Yao Shuai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shuai:Yao", "Nan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Nan", "Heidemarie Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Heidemarie"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
