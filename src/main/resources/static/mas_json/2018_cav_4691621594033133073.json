{"title": "Rabinizer 4: From LTL to Your Favourite Deterministic Automaton.", "fields": ["implementation", "linear temporal logic", "deterministic automaton", "probabilistic logic", "model checking"], "abstract": "We present Rabinizer 4, a tool set for translating formulae of linear temporal logic to different types of deterministic \\(\\omega \\)-automata. The tool set implements and optimizes several recent constructions, including the first implementation translating the frequency extension of LTL. Further, we provide a distribution of PRISM that links Rabinizer and offers model checking procedures for probabilistic systems that are not in the official PRISM distribution. Finally, we evaluate the performance and in cases with any previous implementations we show enhancements both in terms of the size of the automata and the computational time, due to algorithmic as well as implementation improvements.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Jan Kret\u00ednsk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kret=iacute=nsk=yacute=:Jan", "Tobias Meggendorfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meggendorfer:Tobias", "Salomon Sickert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sickert:Salomon", "Christopher Ziegler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Ziegler:Christopher"], "pages": 11}
