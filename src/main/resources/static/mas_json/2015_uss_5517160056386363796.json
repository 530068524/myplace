Specifically, we propose and develop SecGraph (available at [1]), a uniform and open-source Secure Graph data sharing/publishing system. In SecGraph, we systematically study, implement, and evaluate 11 graph data anonymization algorithms, 19 data utility metrics, and 15 modern Structure-based De-Anonymization (SDA) attacks. To the best of our knowledge, SecGraph is the first such system that enables data owners to anonymize data by state-of-the-art anonymization techniques, measure the data's utility, and evaluate the data's vulnerability against modern De-Anonymization (DA) attacks. In addition, SecGraph enables researchers to conduct fair analysis and evaluation of existing and newly developed anonymization/DA techniques. Leveraging SecGraph, we conduct extensive experiments to systematically evaluate the existing graph data anonymization and DA techniques. The results demonstrate that (i) most anonymization schemes can partially or conditionally preserve most graph utilities while losing some application utility; (ii) no DA attack is optimum in all scenarios. The DA performance depends on several factors, e.g., similarity between anonymized and auxiliary data, graph density, and DA heuristics; and (iii) all the state-of-the-art anonymization schemes are vulnerable to several or all of the modern SDA attacks. The degree of vulnerability of each anonymization scheme depends on how much and which data utility it preserves.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "IBM", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Shouling Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Shouling", "Weiqing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Weiqing", "Prateek Mittal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mittal:Prateek", "Xin Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu_0001:Xin", "Raheem A.
