Here we present an experiment comparing 3 window switching interfaces: the Cards interface spreads windows out like a vertical stack of cards with the most recent window at the front; the Mosaic interface places each window in a grid ordered by recency; and, the Expose interface provides an map-like overview based on the relative size and position of windows. Experimental results suggest that the Mosaic interface scales, enabling faster window selection than the Cards interface and less erroneous window selection than the Expose interface.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Andrew Warr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Warr:Andrew", "Ed H.
