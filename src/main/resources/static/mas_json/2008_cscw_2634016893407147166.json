{"title": "Charitable technologies: opportunities for collaborative computing in nonprofit fundraising.", "fields": ["public relations", "management", "gross domestic product", "knowledge management", "revenue"], "abstract": "This paper presents research analyzing the role of computational technology in the domain of nonprofit fundraising. Nonprofits are a cornerstone of many societies and are especially prominent in the United States, where $295 billion, or slightly more than 2% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (i.e. total national revenue), was directed toward charitable causes in 2006. Nonprofits afford many worthwhile endeavors, including crisis relief, basic services to those in need, public education and the arts, and preservation of the natural environment. In this paper, we identify six roles that computational technology plays in support of nonprofit fundraising and present two models characterizing technology use in this domain: (1) a cycle of technology-assisted fundraising and (2) a model of relationships among stakeholders in technology-assisted fundraising. Finally, we identify challenges and research opportunities for collaborative computing in the unique and exciting nonprofit fundraising domain.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jeremy Goecks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goecks:Jeremy", "Amy Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Amy", "Stephen Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Stephen", "Elizabeth D.
