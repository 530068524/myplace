Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our method in terms of both parameter estimation and computational performance.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Princeton University", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Xingguo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xingguo", "Tuo Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Tuo", "Raman Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Raman", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Han", "Jarvis D.
