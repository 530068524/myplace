We describe, from a data-science perspective, our experience of taking the system out of the laboratory into more than thirty homes in Bristol, UK. We describe the infrastructure and processes that had to be developed along the way, describe how we train and deploy Machine Learning systems in this context, and give a realistic appraisal of the state of the deployed systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Amazon.com", "University of Bristol", "University of Tartu", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol"], "authors": ["Tom Diethe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diethe:Tom", "Mike Holmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holmes:Mike", "Meelis Kull.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kull:Meelis", "Miquel Perell\u00f3-Nieto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perell=oacute==Nieto:Miquel", "Kacper Sokol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sokol:Kacper", "Hao Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Hao", "Emma Tonkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tonkin:Emma", "Niall Twomey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Twomey:Niall", "Peter A.
