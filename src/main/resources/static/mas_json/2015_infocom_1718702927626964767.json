{"title": "Harmony: Content resolution for smart devices using acoustic channel.", "fields": ["channel", "throughput", "control channel", "testbed", "harmony"], "abstract": "In this paper, we utilize a novel communication framework Acoustic-WiFi to develop a smart contention resolution scheme Harmony among the contending devices to address the overhead of the traditional Wi-Fi backoff scheme (i.e. contention window countdown, DIFS) and reduce the overall collisions among the devices. Harmony uses the acoustic channel for contention resolution in Wi-Fi networks. To the best of our knowledge, Harmony is the first to leverage the acoustic interface on commodity smart devices as an addition control channel in parallel with the Wi-Fi interface. We evaluate our scheme using real testbed and simulation. Testbed experiments show more than 40% throughput gain over traditional Wi-Fi networks, while simulation results show more than 27% gain for dense networks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Old Dominion University", "Old Dominion University"], "authors": ["Mostafa Uddin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uddin:Mostafa", "Tamer Nadeem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nadeem:Tamer"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
