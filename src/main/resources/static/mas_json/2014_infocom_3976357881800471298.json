A digital terrain model (DTM), available to public with a variable resolution up to one meter, is a 3D representation of a terrain\u2019s surface. It is commonly built using remote sensing technology or from land surveying and can be easily converted to a triangular mesh. Given a sensor network deployed on the surface of a 3D terrain with one-hop distance information available, we can extract a triangular mesh from the connectivity graph of the network. The constraint that the sensors must be on the known 3D terrain\u2019s surface ensures that the triangular meshes of the network and the DTM of the terrain\u2019s surface approximate the same geometric shape and overlap. We propose a fully distributed algorithm to construct a well-aligned mapping between the two triangular meshes. Based on this mapping, each sensor node of the network can easily locate reference grid points from the DTM to calculate its own geographic location. We carry out extensive simulations under various scenarios to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed localization algorithm. We also discuss the possibility of 3D surface network localization with mere connectivity and the results are promising.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "University of Louisiana at Lafayette"], "authors": ["Yang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yang", "Miao Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Miao", "Hongyi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Hongyi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
