{"title": "Cascaded pose regression.", "fields": ["rigid transformation", "labeled data", "parameterized complexity", "pose", "degrees of freedom"], "abstract": "We present a fast and accurate algorithm for computing the 2D pose of objects in images called cascaded pose regression (CPR). CPR progressively refines a loosely specified initial guess, where each refinement is carried out by a different regressor. Each regressor performs simple image measurements that are dependent on the output of the previous regressors; the entire system is automatically learned from human annotated training examples. CPR is not restricted to rigid transformations: \u2018pose\u2019 is any parameterized variation of the object's appearance such as the degrees of freedom of deformable and articulated objects. We compare CPR against both standard regression techniques and human performance (computed from redundant human annotations). Experiments on three diverse datasets (mice, faces, fish) suggest CPR is fast (2\u20133ms per pose estimate), accurate (approaching human performance), and easy to train from small amounts of labeled data.", "citation": "Citations (385)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Piotr Doll\u00e1r.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doll=aacute=r:Piotr", "Peter Welinder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welinder:Peter", "Pietro Perona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perona:Pietro"], "pages": 8}
