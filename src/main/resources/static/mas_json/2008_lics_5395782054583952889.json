This is a tree extension of the Simon theorem, which says that a string language can be defined by a boolean combination of Sigma 1  formulas if and only if its syntactic monoid is J-trivial.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "Boston College"], "authors": ["Mikolaj Bojanczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bojanczyk:Mikolaj", "Luc Segoufin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segoufin:Luc", "Howard Straubing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Straubing:Howard"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
