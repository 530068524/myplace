{"title": "Mining User Dwell Time for Personalized Web Search Re-Ranking.", "fields": ["data mining", "ranking", "web page", "dwell time", "search engine"], "abstract": "We propose a personalized re-ranking algorithm through mining user dwell times derived from a user's previously online reading or browsing activities. We acquire document level user dwell times via a customized web browser, from which we then infer conceptword level user dwell times in order to understand a user's personal interest. According to the estimated concept word level user dwell times, our algorithm can estimate a user's potential dwell time over a new document, based on which personalized webpage re-ranking can be carried out. We compare the rankings produced by our algorithm with rankings generated by popular commercial search engines and a recently proposed personalized ranking algorithm. The results clearly show the superiority of our method.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Songhua Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Songhua", "Hao Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0011:Hao", "Francis Chi-Moon Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Francis_Chi=Moon"], "pages": 6}
