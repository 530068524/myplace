We describe an approach called the Remote Assessment of Fault Tolerance (RAFT). The key technique in a RAFT is to measure the time taken for a server to respond to a read request for a collection of file blocks. The larger the number of hard drives across which a file is distributed, the faster the read-request response. Erasure codes also play an important role in our solution. We describe a theoretical framework for RAFTs and offer experimental evidence that RAFTs can work in practice in several settings of interest.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "RSA Laboratorie ... bridge, MA, USA", "RSA Laboratorie ... bridge, MA, USA", "RSA Laboratorie ... bridge, MA, USA", "RSA Laboratorie ... bridge, MA, USA"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Kevin D.
