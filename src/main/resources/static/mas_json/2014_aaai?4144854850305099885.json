We assume each agent can withhold some endowments, as well as misreport her preference. Under this assumption, strategyproofness requires that for each agent, reporting her true preference with revealing all her endowments is a dominant strategy, and thus implies individual rationality. Our objective in this paper is to analyze the effect of such private ownership in exchange economies with multiple endowments. As fundamental results, we first show that the revelation principle holds under a natural assumption and that strategyproofness and Pareto efficiency are incompatible even under the lexicographic preference domain. We then propose a class of exchange rules, each of which has a corresponding directed graph to prescribe possible trades, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the graph structure so that they satisfy strategyproofness.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Kyushu University", "Kyushu University", "Kyushu University"], "authors": ["Taiki Todo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Todo:Taiki", "Haixin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Haixin", "Makoto Yokoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yokoo:Makoto"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
