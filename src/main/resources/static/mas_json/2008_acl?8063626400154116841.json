{"title": "Randomized Language Models via Perfect Hash Functions.", "fields": ["rolling hash", "swifft", "hash filter", "dynamic perfect hashing", "hash tree"], "abstract": "We propose a succinct randomized language model which employs a perfect hash function to encode fingerprints of n-grams and their associated probabilities, backoff weights, or other parameters. The scheme can represent any standard n-gram model and is easily combined with existing model reduction techniques such as entropy-pruning. We demonstrate the space-savings of the scheme via machine translation experiments within a distributed language modeling framework.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Google"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["David Talbot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talbot:David", "Thorsten Brants.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brants:Thorsten"], "pages": 9}
