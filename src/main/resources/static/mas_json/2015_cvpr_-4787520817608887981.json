The lack of color information and limitations of current commodity depth sensors make this task a challenging computer vision problem, and a standard random sampling based approach is prohibitively time-consuming. We propose to address this difficult problem by generating promising inlier sets for pose estimation by early rejection of clear outliers with the help of local belief propagation (or dynamic programming). By exploiting data-parallelism our method is fast, and we also do not rely on a computationally expensive training phase. We demonstrate state-of-the art performance on a standard dataset and illustrate our approach on challenging real sequences.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Toshiba", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Toshiba"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Christopher Zach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zach:Christopher", "Adri\u00e1n Pe\u00f1ate S\u00e1nchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=aacute=nchez:Adri=aacute=n_Pe=ntilde=ate", "Minh-Tri Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Minh=Tri"], "pages": 8}
