However, cost and usability are significant barriers to its widespread adoption. To this end, we present SpiroSmart, a low-cost mobile phone application that performs spirometry sensing using the built-in microphone. We evaluate SpiroSmart on 52 subjects, showing that the mean error when compared to a clinical spirometer is 5.1% for common measures of lung function. Finally, we show that pulmonologists can use SpiroSmart to diagnose varying degrees of obstructive lung ailments.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Seattle Children's", "Seattle Children's"], "authors": ["Eric C.
