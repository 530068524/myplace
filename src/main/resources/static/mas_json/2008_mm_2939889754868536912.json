{"title": "VSYNC: a novel video file synchronization protocol.", "fields": ["video processing", "multiview video coding", "vsync", "file synchronization", "retransmission"], "abstract": "VSYNC is a novel incremental video file synchronization system that efficiently synchronizes two video files at remote ends through a bi-directional communications link. Retransmission of a video file that has been modified only slightly, for the purpose of synchronization with a remote-end copy, is extremely expensive but avoidable. VSYNC is a bi-directional algorithm designed to automatically detect and transmit changes in the modified video file without the knowledge of what was changed. Another feature of VSYNC is that it allows synchronization to within some user defined distortion constraint. A hierarchical hashing scheme is designed to compare video chunks, converting the high-level content information to a low-level hash stream that is more amenable to the tools of coding theory. Our approach shows impressive gains in transmission rate-savings. In a typical example of two 12 sec video files with about 10% of the frames being edited, transmission savings of 44% to 87% can be obtained compared to directly sending the updated video files using H.264 and rsync [1].", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Hao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Hao", "Chuohao Yeo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeo:Chuohao", "Kannan Ramchandran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramchandran:Kannan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
