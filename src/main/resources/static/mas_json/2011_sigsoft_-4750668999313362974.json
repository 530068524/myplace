Reconfiguration must be done in a safe and low-disruptive way. In this paper, we propose version consistency of distributed transactions as a safe criterion for dynamic reconfiguration. Version consistency ensures that distributed transactions be served as if there were operating on a single coherent version of the system despite possible reconfigurations that may happen meanwhile. The paper also proposes a distributed algorithm to maintain dynamic dependences between components at architectural level and enable low-disruptive version-consistent dynamic reconfigurations. An initial assessment through simulation shows the benefits of the proposed approach with respect to timeliness and low degree of disruption.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Xiaoxing Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaoxing", "Luciano Baresi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baresi:Luciano", "Carlo Ghezzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghezzi:Carlo", "Valerio Panzica La Manna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manna:Valerio_Panzica_La", "Jian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0001:Jian"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2011", "pages": 11}
