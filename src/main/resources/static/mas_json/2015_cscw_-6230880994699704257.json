{"title": "Outnumbered but Well-Spoken: Female Commenters in the New York Times.", "fields": ["social psychology", "computer mediated communication", "psychology"], "abstract": "Using eight months of online comments on New York Times articles, we find that only 28% of commenters of identifiable gender are female, but that their comments receive more recommendations from other readers. Comments from women are more common on forums about parenting, fashion, and health, and on articles written by women. The number of recommendations comments from women receive is positively correlated with the percentage of men on a forum, and the number of recommendations men receive is negatively correlated with the percentage of men on a forum. Female commenters are more likely to remain anonymous and anonymous commenters receive fewer recommendations. Male and female commenters differ in their choice of topics to emphasize, backgrounds, and language; we find three specific examples in responses to articles about sexual assault, contraception, and farm subsidies. We discuss the implications of these gender differences for democratic discourse and suggest ways to increase gender parity.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Stanford University"], "authors": ["Emma Pierson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pierson:Emma"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
