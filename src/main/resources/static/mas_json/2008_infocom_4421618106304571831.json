{"title": "CTU: Capturing Throughput Dependencies in UWB Networks.", "fields": ["ultra wideband", "pulse position modulation", "physical layer", "delay spread", "multipath propagation"], "abstract": "The inherent channel characteristics of impulse-based UWB networks affect the MAC layer performance significantly. Previous studies on evaluating MAC protocols are based on prolonged simulations, and do not account for the multiple-access interference that arises due to multipath delay spread. In this work, we develop CTU, an analytical framework that captures the performance of MAC protocols, while taking into account the underlying PHY layer effects. The key attributes that make CTU novel are: (a) It is modular and therefore flexible; it can be easily modified to provide a basis for characterizing and evaluating a wide range of MAC protocols designed for impulse-based UWB networks. The only requirements are that the MAC protocol under study be based on time-hopping, and the modulation scheme be pulse position modulation; these are common design decisions in most impulse based UWB networks, (b) It considers the channel characteristics in addition to MAC layer effects; in particular, CTU correlates probabilistically the multipath delay profile of the channel with the packet error rate. We employ CTU to evaluate the performance of a generic medium access procedure. We compare the results with those from extensive simulations and show the high accuracy of CTU. We use CTU to assess the impact of various system parameters on the MAC layer performance; we make several interesting observations that are discussed in depth.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside"], "authors": ["Ioannis Broustis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broustis:Ioannis", "Angelos Vlavianos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vlavianos:Angelos", "Prashant Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Prashant", "Srikanth V.
