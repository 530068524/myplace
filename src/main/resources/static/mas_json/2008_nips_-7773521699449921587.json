A robotic manipulator will often need to be controlled while holding different loads in its end effector, giving rise to a multi-task learning problem. By placing independent Gaussian process priors over the latent functions of the inverse dynamics, we obtain a multi-task Gaussian process prior for handling multiple loads, where the inter-task similarity depends on the underlying inertial parameters. Experiments demonstrate that this multi-task formulation is effective in sharing information among the various loads, and generally improves performance over either learning only on single tasks or pooling the data over all tasks.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kian Ming Adam Chai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chai:Kian_Ming_Adam", "Christopher K.
