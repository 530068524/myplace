{"title": "TailCutter: Wisely cutting tail latency in cloud CDN under cost constraints.", "fields": ["latency", "workload", "world wide web", "cloud computing", "upload", "low latency", "real time computing", "search engine", "user experience design"], "abstract": "Cloud computing platforms enable applications to offer low latency access to user data by offering storage services in several geographically distributed data centers. In this paper, we identify the high tail latency problem in cloud CDN via analyzing a large-scale dataset collected from 783,944 users in a major cloud CDN. We find that the data downloading latency in cloud CDN is highly variable, which may significantly degrade the user experience of applications. To address the problem, we present TailCutter, a workload scheduling mechanism that aims at optimizing the tail latency while meeting the cost constraint given by application providers. We further design the Maximum Tail Minimization Algorithm (MTMA) working in TailCutter mechanism to optimally solve the Tail Latency Minimization (TLM) problem in polynomial time. We implement TailCutter across data centers of Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure. Our extensive evaluation using large-scale real world data traces shows that TailCutter can reduce up to 68% 99th percentile user-perceived latency in comparison with alternative solutions under cost constraints.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "City University of Hong Kong", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Zeqi Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Zeqi", "Yong Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui_0001:Yong", "Minming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Minming", "Zhenhua Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Zhenhua", "Ningwei Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Ningwei", "Yuchi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yuchi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
