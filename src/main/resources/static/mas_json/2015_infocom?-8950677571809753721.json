{"title": "Energy-aware wireless scheduling with near optimal backlog and convergence time tradeoffs.", "fields": ["logarithm", "wireless", "queue", "algorithm design", "convergence", "channel"], "abstract": "This paper considers a wireless link with randomly arriving data that are queued and served over a time-varying channel. It is known that any algorithm that comes within    $\\epsilon $   of the minimum average power required for queue stability must incur average queue size at least   $\\Omega (\\log (1/\\epsilon ))$  . However, the optimal convergence time is unknown. This paper develops a scheduling algorithm that, for any   $\\epsilon >0$  , achieves the optimal    $O(\\log (1/\\epsilon ))$   average queue size tradeoff with a convergence time of   $O(\\log (1/\\epsilon )/\\epsilon )$  . An example system is presented for which all algorithms require convergence time at least   $\\Omega (1/\\epsilon )$  , and so the proposed algorithm is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal convergence time. The method uses the simple drift-plus-penalty technique with an improved convergence time analysis.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Michael J.
