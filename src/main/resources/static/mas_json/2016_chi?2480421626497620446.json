{"title": "Challenging the Car Norm: Opportunities for ICT to Support Sustainable Transportation Practices.", "fields": ["scale up", "unit of analysis", "sustainable transport", "norm", "practice theory"], "abstract": "The use of practices as a unit of analysis has been suggested in order to scale up efforts within sustainable HCI and to shift the focus from changing individual behaviours to supporting transitions at a societal level. In this paper, we take a practice approach to the case of sustainable transportation, and more specifically to car-free transportation. Car use is intertwined in many practices and managing life without a car is difficult, particularly for people in contexts where owning at least one car per family is the norm. We studied three families in Stockholm who replaced their cars with different combinations of light electric vehicles during one year. From the families' experiences, we identified a number of opportunities for designers of interactive technologies to support environmental pioneers in the particular case of car-free living, as well as to support transitions towards sustainable practices in general.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology", "KTH-Royal Insti ... ockholm, Sweden"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Hanna Hasselqvist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasselqvist:Hanna", "Mia Hesselgren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hesselgren:Mia", "Cristian Bogdan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogdan:Cristian"], "pages": 12}
