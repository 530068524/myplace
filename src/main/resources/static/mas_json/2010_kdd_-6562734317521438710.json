Simple correlation over time is typically not meaningful, since users change their preferences due to different external events. User behavior can often be determined by individual's long-term and short-term preferences. How to represent users' long-term and short-term preferences? How to leverage them for temporal recommendation? To address these challenges, we propose Session-based Temporal Graph (STG) which simultaneously models users' long-term and short-term preferences over time. Based on the STG model framework, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm Injected Preference Fusion (IPF) and extend the personalized Random Walk for temporal recommendation. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method using two real datasets on citations and social bookmarking, in which our proposed method IPF gives 15%-34% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (309)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "IBM", "IBM", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Liang Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Liang", "Quan Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Quan", "Shiwan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shiwan", "Li Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0009:Li", "Xiatian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiatian", "Qing Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Qing", "Jimeng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jimeng"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
