{"title": "Enabling generic keyword search over raw XML data.", "fields": ["xml catalog", "xml framework", "xml encryption", "xml schema editor", "simple api for xml"], "abstract": "Classical XML keyword search based on the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) framework requires users to be well versed with data and semantic relationships between the query keywords to extract meaningful response, restricting its applicability. GKS (Generic Keyword Search), on the other hand, allows users to browse and navigate XML data without such constraints. GKS enables discovery of deeper insights (DI) in the XML data, found in the context of the search results. Such insights not only expose patterns hidden in the search results but also help users tune their queries, thus enabling the navigation of complex XML repositories with ease. We further show how, for a search query, different insights can be discovered from the data by varying a single parameter.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "authors": ["Manoj K.
