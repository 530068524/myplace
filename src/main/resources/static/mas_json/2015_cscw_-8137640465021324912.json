{"title": "Massive Open Online Proctor: Protecting the Credibility of MOOCs certificates.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "credibility", "cheating", "scalability", "certification"], "abstract": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) enable everyone to receive high-quality education. However, current MOOC creators cannot provide an effective, economical, and scalable method to detect cheating on tests, which would be required for any certification. In this paper, we propose a Massive Open Online Proctoring (MOOP) framework, which combines both automatic and collaborative approaches to detect cheating behaviors in online tests. The MOOP framework consists of three major components: Automatic Cheating Detector (ACD), Peer Cheating Detector (PCD), and Final Review Committee (FRC). ACD uses webcam video or other sensors to monitor students and automatically flag suspected cheating behavior. Ambiguous cases are then sent to the PCD, where students peer-review flagged webcam video to confirm suspicious cheating behaviors. Finally, the list of suspicious cheating behaviors is sent to the FRC to make the final punishing decision. Our experiment show that ACD and PCD can detect usage of a cheat sheet with good accuracy and can reduce the overall human resources required to monitor MOOCs for cheating.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Xuanchong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xuanchong", "Kai-min Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kai=min", "Yueran Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Yueran", "Alexander G.
