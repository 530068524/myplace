Most existing approaches to plan recognition and other abductive tasks employ either purely logical methods that do not handle uncertainty, or purely probabilistic methods that do not handle structured representations. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces an approach to abductive reasoning using a first-order probabilistic logic, specifically Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). It introduces several novel techniques for making MLNs efficient and effective for abduction. Experiments on three plan recognition datasets show the benefit of our approach over existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Parag Singla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singla:Parag", "Raymond J.
