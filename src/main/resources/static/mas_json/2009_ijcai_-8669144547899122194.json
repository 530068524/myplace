We study CQ answering in (extensions of) the DL EL, which is popular for large-scale ontologies and underlies the designated OWL2-EL profile of OWL2. Our main contribution is a novel approach to CQ answering that enables the use of standard relational database systems as the basis for query execution. We evaluate our approach using the IBM DB2 system, with encouraging results.", "citation": "Citations (211)", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Waterloo", "University of Liverpool"], "authors": ["Carsten Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Carsten", "David Toman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toman:David", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
