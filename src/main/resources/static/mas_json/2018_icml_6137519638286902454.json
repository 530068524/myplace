In most applications, GAN models share two aspects in common. On the one hand, GANs training involves solving a challenging saddle point optimization problem, interpreted as an adversarial game between a generator and a discriminator functions. On the other hand, the generator and the discriminator are parametrized in terms of deep convolutional neural networks. The goal of this paper is to disentangle the contribution of these two factors to the success of GANs. In particular, we introduce Generative Latent Optimization (GLO), a framework to train deep convolutional generators without using discriminators, thus avoiding the instability of adversarial optimization problems. Throughout a variety of experiments, we show that GLO enjoys many of the desirable properties of GANs: learning from large data, synthesizing visually-appealing samples, interpolating meaningfully between samples, and performing linear arithmetic with noise vectors.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "authors": ["Piotr Bojanowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bojanowski:Piotr", "Armand Joulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joulin:Armand", "David Lopez-Paz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lopez=Paz:David", "Arthur Szlam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szlam:Arthur"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
