{"title": "Exploiting Short Supports for Generalised Arc Consistency for Arbitrary Constraints.", "fields": ["local consistency", "mathematical optimization", "discrete mathematics", "propagator", "tuple"], "abstract": "Special-purpose constraint propagation algorithms (such as those for the element constraint) frequently make implicit use of short supports - by examining a subset of the variables, they can infer support for all other variables and values and save substantial work. However, to date general purpose propagation algorithms (such as GAC-Schema) rely upon supports involving all variables. We demonstrate how to employ short supports in a new general purpose propagation algorithm called SHORTGAC. This works when provided with either an explicit list of allowed short tuples, or a function to calculate the next supporting short tuple. Empirical analyses demonstrate the efficiency of SHORTGAC compared to other general-purpose propagation algorithms. In some cases SHORTGAC even exhibits similar performance to special-purpose propagators.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of St Andrews", "University of St Andrews", "University of St Andrews", "University of St Andrews"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Peter Nightingale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nightingale:Peter", "Ian P.
