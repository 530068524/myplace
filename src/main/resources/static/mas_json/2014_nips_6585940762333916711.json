As a result, we construct first-order primal-dual methods with optimal convergence rates on the primal objective residual and the primal feasibility gap of their iterates separately. Through a dual smoothing and prox-center selection strategy, our framework subsumes the augmented Lagrangian, alternating direction, and dual fast-gradient methods as special cases, where our rates apply.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Quoc Tran-Dinh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran=Dinh:Quoc", "Volkan Cevher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cevher:Volkan"], "pages": 9}
