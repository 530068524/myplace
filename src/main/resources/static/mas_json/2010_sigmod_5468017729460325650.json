In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the size of a hidden database through its web interface. We propose novel techniques which use a small number of queries to produce unbiased estimates with small variance. These techniques can also be used for approximate query processing over hidden databases. We present theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "George Washington University", "University of Texas at Arlington", "George Washington University", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Arjun Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Arjun", "Xin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xin", "Bradley Jewell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jewell:Bradley", "Nan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Nan", "Gautam Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das_0001:Gautam"], "pages": 12}
