{"title": "Sequence-Form and Evolutionary Dynamics: Realization Equivalence to Agent Form and Logit Dynamics.", "fields": ["extensive form game", "logit", "evolutionary dynamics", "equivalence", "evolutionary game theory"], "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory provides the principal tools to model the dynamics of multi\u2013agent learning algorithms. While there is a long\u2013standing literature on evolutionary game theory in strategic\u2013form games, in the case of extensive\u2013form games few results are known and the exponential size of the representations currently adopted makes the evolutionary analysis of such games unaffordable. In this paper, we focus on dynamics for the sequence form of extensive\u2013form games, providing three dynamics: one realization equivalent to the normal\u2013form logit dynamic, one realization equivalent to the agent\u2013form replicator dynamic, and one realization equivalent to the agent\u2013form logit dynamic. All the considered dynamics require polynomial time and space, providing an exponential compression w.r.t. the dynamics currently known and providing thus tools that can be effectively employed in practice. Moreover, we use our tools to compare the agent\u2013form and normal\u2013 form dynamics and to provide new \"hybrid\" dynamics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Nicola Gatti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gatti_0001:Nicola", "Marcello Restelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Restelli:Marcello"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
