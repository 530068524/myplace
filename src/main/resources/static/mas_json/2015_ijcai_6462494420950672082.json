It is generally accepted that true scalability in this setting can only be achieved via query rewriting, which in turn allows for the exploitation of standard RDBMSs. In this work, we close two open fundamental questions related to query rewriting. We establish that linear existential rules are polynomially combined rewritable, while full linear rules are polynomially (purely) rewritable; in both cases, the target query language consists of first-order or non-recursive Datalog queries. An immediate consequence of our results is that DLR-LiteR, the extension of DL-LiteR with n-ary roles, is polynomially combined rewritable.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Calabria", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Georg Gottlob.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottlob:Georg", "Marco Manna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manna:Marco", "Andreas Pieris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pieris:Andreas"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
