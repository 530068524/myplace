{"title": "A Logic for Algebraic Effects.", "fields": ["many valued logic", "predicate functor logic", "algebraic sentence", "zeroth order logic", "signature"], "abstract": "We present a logic for algebraic effects, based on the algebraic representation of computational effects by operations and equations. We begin with the a-calculus, a minimal calculus which separates values, effects, and computations and thereby canonises the order of evaluation. This is extended to obtain the logic, which is a classical first-order multi-sorted logic with higher-order value and computation types, as in Levy's call-by-push-value, a principle of induction over computations, a free algebra principle, and predicate fixed points. This logic embraces Moggi's computational lambda-calculus, and also, via definable modalities, Hennessy-Milner logic, and evaluation logic, though Hoare logic presents difficulties.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Gordon D.
