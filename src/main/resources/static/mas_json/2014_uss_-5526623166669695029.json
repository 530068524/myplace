{"title": "Automatically Detecting Vulnerable Websites Before They Turn Malicious.", "fields": ["computer science", "web page", "internet privacy", "computer security", "data mining"], "abstract": "Significant recent research advances have made it possible to design systems that can automatically determine with high accuracy the maliciousness of a target website. While highly useful, such systems are reactive by nature. In this paper, we take a complementary approach, and attempt to design, implement, and evaluate a novel classification system which predicts, whether a given, not yet compromised website will become malicious in the future. We adapt several techniques from data mining and machine learning which are particularly well-suited for this problem. A key aspect of our system is that the set of features it relies on is automatically extracted from the data it acquires; this allows us to be able to detect new attack trends relatively quickly. We evaluate our implementation on a corpus of 444,519 websites, containing a total of 4,916,203 webpages, and show that we manage to achieve good detection accuracy over a one-year horizon; that is, we generally manage to correctly predict that currently benign websites will become compromised within a year.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Kyle Soska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soska:Kyle", "Nicolas Christin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christin:Nicolas"], "pages": 16}
