Formulating shapes by configuration matrices of landmarks, and using the fact that subspaces (e.g. range spaces) of these matrices are invariant to affine transformations, the shape correspondence is modelled as a permutation relation between orthogonal projection matrices of the subspaces. Then the matching result is solved by an efficient factorization procedure for rank-deficient matrices. The algorithm is compact, fast, and independent of dimensions. Experimental results for 1D, 2D and 3D matchings of synthetic and real data are provided, which demonstrate potential applications of the algorithm to shape analysis, and to other related problems like wide baseline stereo matching and range data registration.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Beihang University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhaozhong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhaozhong", "Han Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Han"], "pages": 6}
