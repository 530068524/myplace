{"title": "Complexity Results for Compressing Optimal Paths.", "fields": ["graph", "longest path problem", "arc", "compression", "shortest path problem"], "abstract": "In this work we give a first tractability analysis of Compressed Path Databases, space efficient oracles used to very quickly identify the first arc on a shortest path. We study the complexity of computing an optimal compressed path database for general directed and undirected graphs. We find that in both cases the problem is NP-complete. We also show that, for graphs which can be decomposed along articulation points, the problem can be decomposed into independent parts, with a corresponding reduction in its level of difficulty. In particular, this leads to simple and tractable algorithms which yield optimal compression results for trees.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["IBM", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "NICTA"], "authors": ["Adi Botea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Botea:Adi", "Ben Strasser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strasser:Ben", "Daniel Harabor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harabor:Daniel"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
