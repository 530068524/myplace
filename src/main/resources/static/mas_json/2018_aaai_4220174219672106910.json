{"title": "Regularizing Deep Networks Using Efficient Layerwise Adversarial Training.", "fields": ["machine learning", "robustness", "test data", "artificial neural network", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "Adversarial training has been shown to regularize deep neural networks in addition to increasing their robustness to adversarial examples. However, its impact on very deep state of the art networks has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we present an efficient approach to perform adversarial training by perturbing intermediate layer activations and study the use of such perturbations as a regularizer during training. We use these perturbations to train very deep models such as ResNets and show improvement in performance both on adversarial and original test data. Our experiments highlight the benefits of perturbing intermediate layer activations compared to perturbing only the inputs. The results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show the merits of the proposed adversarial training approach. Additional results on WideResNets show that our approach provides significant improvement in classification accuracy for a given base model, outperforming dropout and other base models of larger size.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "General Electric"], "authors": ["Swami Sankaranarayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankaranarayanan:Swami", "Arpit Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Arpit", "Rama Chellappa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chellappa:Rama", "Ser-Nam Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Ser=Nam"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
