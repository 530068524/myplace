{"title": "Indexing Public-Private Graphs.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "reachability", "directed graph", "theoretical computer science", "graph"], "abstract": "We consider the reachability indexing problem for private-public directed graphs. In these graphs nodes come in three flavors: public--nodes visible to all users, private--nodes visible to a specific set of users, and protected--nodes visible to any user who can see at least one of the node's parents. We are interested in computing the set of nodes visible to a specific user online. There are two obvious algorithms: precompute the result for every user, or run a reachability algorithm at query time. This paper explores the trade-off between these two strategies.\n\nOur approach is to identify a set of additional visible seed nodes for each user. The online reachability algorithm explores the graph starting at these nodes. We first formulate the problem as asymmetric k-center with outliers, and then give an efficient and practical algorithm. We prove new theoretical guarantees for this problem and show empirically that it performs very well in practice.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Aaron Archer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Archer:Aaron", "Silvio Lattanzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lattanzi:Silvio", "Peter Likarish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Likarish:Peter", "Sergei Vassilvitskii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vassilvitskii:Sergei"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
