{"title": "Propitious aggregation: reducing participant burden in ego-centric network data collection.", "fields": ["id ego and super ego", "user interface", "data collection", "social network", "survey methodology"], "abstract": "One of the central challenges of ego-centric or personal social network research is minimizing the quantity of data that is requested from research participants while ensuring high data accuracy and validity. In general, collecting data about increasingly larger ego-centric networks places an increasing burden on respondents. The web-based Propitious Aggregation of Social Networks (PASN, http://pro.pitio.us) survey instrument reduces this burden by leveraging network data already available in the context of social network websites, and by providing an intuitive click-and-drag interface for survey responses. An experiment was conducted ( N  = 85), and the PASN method was found to produce networks which were significantly larger and more diverse than those produced using standard survey methods, yet required significantly lower time investments from participants.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Derek Lackaff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lackaff:Derek"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
