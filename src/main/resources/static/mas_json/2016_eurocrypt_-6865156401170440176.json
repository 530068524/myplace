{"title": "Hash-Function Based PRFs: AMAC and Its Multi-User Security.", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "distributed computing", "hash function", "multi user", "truncation"], "abstract": "$$\\mathsf {AMAC}$$AMAC is a simple and fast candidate construction of a PRF from an MD-style hash function which applies the keyed hash function and then a cheap, un-keyed output transform such as truncation. Spurred by its use in the widely-deployed Ed25519 signature scheme, this paper investigates the provable PRF security of $$\\mathsf {AMAC}$$AMAC to deliver the following three-fold message: 1 First, we prove PRF security of $$\\mathsf {AMAC}$$AMAC. 2 Second, we show that $$\\mathsf {AMAC}$$AMAC has a quite unique and attractive feature, namely that its multi-user security is essentially as good as its single-user security and in particular superior in some settings to that of competitors. 3 Third, it is technically interesting, its security and analysis intrinsically linked to security of the compression function in the presence of leakage.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Daniel J.
