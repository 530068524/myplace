{"title": "Parallel reduction to condensed forms for symmetric eigenvalue problems using aggregated fine-grained and memory-aware kernels.", "fields": ["symmetric matrix", "granularity", "qr decomposition", "sparse matrix", "tridiagonal matrix"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel implementation in reducing a symmetric dense matrix to tridiagonal form, which is the preprocessing step toward solving symmetric eigenvalue problems. Based on  tile algorithms , the reduction follows a two-stage approach, where the tile matrix is first reduced to symmetric band form prior to the final condensed structure. The challenging trade-off between algorithmic performance and task granularity has been tackled through a  grouping  technique, which consists of aggregating fine-grained and memory-aware computational tasks during both stages, while sustaining the application's overall high performance. A dynamic runtime environment system then schedules the different tasks in an out-of-order fashion. The performance for the tridiagonal reduction reported in this paper is unprecedented. Our implementation results in up to 50-fold and 12-fold improvement (130 Gflop/s) compared to the equivalent routines from LAPACK V3.2 and Intel MKL V10.3, respectively, on an eight socket hexa-core AMD Opteron multicore shared-memory system with a matrix size of 24000 x 24000.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "University of Tennessee"], "authors": ["Azzam Haidar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haidar:Azzam", "Hatem Ltaief.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ltaief:Hatem", "Jack J.
