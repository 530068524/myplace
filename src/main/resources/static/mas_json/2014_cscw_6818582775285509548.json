{"title": "Specialization, homophily, and gender in a social curation site: findings from pinterest.", "fields": ["homophily", "internet privacy", "social network", "computer science"], "abstract": "Pinterest is a popular social curation site where people collect, organize, and share pictures of items. We studied a fundamental issue for such sites: what patterns of activity attract attention (audience and content reposting)-- We organized our studies around two key factors: the extent to which users specialize in particular topics, and homophily among users. We also considered the existence of differences between female and male users. We found: (a) women and men differed in the types of content they collected and the degree to which they specialized; male Pinterest users were not particularly interested in stereotypically male topics; (b) sharing diverse types of content increases your following, but only up to a certain point; (c) homophily drives repinning: people repin content from other users who share their interests; homophily also affects following, but to a lesser extent. Our findings suggest strategies both for users (e.g., strategies to attract an audience) and maintainers (e.g., content recommendation methods) of social curation sites.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Shuo Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Shuo", "Vikas Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Vikas", "Eric Gilbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilbert:Eric", "Loren G.
