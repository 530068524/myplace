The proposed model is a cyclic directed graphical model, which provides an intuitive representation for the dependencies among multiple label variables, and a well integrated framework for efficient model training using binary classifiers and label predictions using Gibbs sampling inference. Our experiments show the proposed conditional model can effectively exploit the label dependency to improve multilabel classification performance.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yuhong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yuhong", "Suicheng Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Suicheng"], "pages": 6}
