Bellman Error Basis Functions (BEBFs) have been shown to improve policy evaluation, with a convergence rate similar to that of value iteration. We propose a simple, fast and robust algorithm based on random projections, which generates BEBFs for sparse feature spaces. We provide a finite sample analysis of the proposed method, and prove that projections logarithmic in the dimension of the original space guarantee a contraction in the error. Empirical results demonstrate the strength of this method in domains in which choosing a good state representation is challenging.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Mahdi Milani Fard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fard:Mahdi_Milani", "Yuri Grinberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grinberg:Yuri", "Amir-massoud Farahmand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farahmand:Amir=massoud", "Joelle Pineau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pineau:Joelle", "Doina Precup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Precup:Doina"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
