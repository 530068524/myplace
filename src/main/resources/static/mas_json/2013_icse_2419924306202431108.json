The difficulty in doing this is focusing on the interesting behaviors among an unbounded number of behaviors.     We present a new technique for automatically generating tests that drive a web-based application along interesting behaviors, where the interesting behavior is specified in the form of \"business rules.\" Business rules are a general mechanism for describing business logic, access control, or even navigational properties of an application's GUI. Our technique is black box, in that it does not analyze the application's server-side implementation, but relies on directed crawling via the application's GUI. To handle the unbounded number of GUI states, the technique includes two phases. Phase 1 creates an abstract state-transition diagram using a relaxed notion of equivalence of GUI states without considering rules. Next, Phase 2 identifies rule-relevant abstract paths and refines those paths using a stricter notion of state equivalence. Our technique can be much more effective at covering business rules than an undirected technique, developed as an enhancement of an existing test-generation technique. Our experiments showed that the former was able to cover 92% of the rules, compared to 52% of the rules covered by the latter.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["IBM", "Indian Institute of Science", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Suresh Thummalapenta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thummalapenta:Suresh", "K.
