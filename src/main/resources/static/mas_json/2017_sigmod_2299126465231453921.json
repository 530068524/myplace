{"title": "Snorkel: Fast Training Set Generation for Information Extraction.", "fields": ["subject matter expert", "deep learning", "bottleneck", "scientific literature", "simple function"], "abstract": "State-of-the art machine learning methods such as deep learning rely on large sets of hand-labeled  training data . Collecting training data is prohibitively slow and expensive, especially when technical domain expertise is required; even the largest technology companies struggle with this challenge. We address this critical bottleneck with Snorkel, a new system for quickly creating, managing, and modeling training sets. Snorkel enables users to generate large volumes of training data by writing labeling functions, which are simple functions that express heuristics and other weak supervision strategies. These user-authored  labeling functions  may have low accuracies and may overlap and conflict, but Snorkel automatically learns their accuracies and synthesizes their output labels. Experiments and theory show that surprisingly, by modeling the labeling process in this way, we can train high-accuracy machine learning models even using potentially lower-accuracy inputs. Snorkel is currently used in production at top technology and consulting companies, and used by researchers to extract information from electronic health records, after-action combat reports, and the scientific literature. In this demonstration, we focus on the challenging task of information extraction, a common application of Snorkel in practice. Using the task of extracting corporate employment relationships from news articles, we will demonstrate and build intuition for a radically different way of developing machine learning systems which allows us to effectively bypass the bottleneck of hand-labeling training data.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Alexander J.
