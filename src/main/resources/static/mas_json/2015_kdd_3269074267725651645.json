In this paper, we propose a scalable distributed Bayesian matrix factorization algorithm using stochastic gradient MCMC. Our algorithm, based on Distributed Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, can not only match the prediction accuracy of standard MCMC methods like Gibbs sampling, but at the same time is as fast and simple as stochastic gradient descent. In our experiments, we show that our algorithm can achieve the same level of prediction accuracy as Gibbs sampling an order of magnitude faster. We also show that our method reduces the prediction error as fast as distributed stochastic gradient descent, achieving a 4.1% improvement in RMSE for the Netflix dataset and an 1.8% for the Yahoo music dataset.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Google", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Sungjin Ahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahn:Sungjin", "Anoop Korattikara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korattikara:Anoop", "Nathan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Nathan", "Suju Rajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajan:Suju", "Max Welling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welling:Max"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
