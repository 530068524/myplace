{"title": "Structuring Wikipedia Articles with Section Recommendations.", "fields": ["structuring", "readability", "entry point", "collaborative filtering", "topic model"], "abstract": "Sections are the building blocks of Wikipedia articles. They enhance readability and can be used as a structured entry point for creating and expanding articles. Structuring a new or already existing Wikipedia article with sections is a hard task for humans, especially for newcomers or less experienced editors, as it requires significant knowledge about how a well-written article looks for each possible topic. Inspired by this need, the present paper defines the problem of section recommendation for Wikipedia articles and proposes several approaches for tackling it. Our systems can help editors by recommending what sections to add to already existing or newly created Wikipedia articles. Our basic paradigm is to generate recommendations by sourcing sections from articles that are similar to the input article. We explore several ways of defining similarity for this purpose (based on topic modeling, collaborative filtering, and Wikipedia's category system). We use both automatic and human evaluation approaches for assessing the performance of our recommendation system, concluding that the category-based approach works best, achieving precision@10 of about 80% in the human evaluation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Stanford University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Wikimedia Found ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Tiziano Piccardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piccardi:Tiziano", "Michele Catasta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catasta:Michele", "Leila Zia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zia:Leila", "Robert West.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/West_0001:Robert"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
