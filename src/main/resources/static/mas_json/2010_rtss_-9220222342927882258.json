In particular, emerging low-power wireless audio platforms provide an economical solution for ad hoc voice communication in emergency scenarios. In this paper, we develop a system called Adaptive Stream Multicast (ASM) for voice communication over multi-hop LWNs. ASM is composed of several novel components specially designed to deliver robust voice quality for multiple sinks in dynamic environments: 1) an empirical model to automatically evaluate the voice quality perceived at sinks based on current network condition, 2) a feedback-based Forward Error Correction scheme where the source can adapt its coding redundancy ratio dynamically in response to the voice quality variation at sinks, 3) a Tree-based Opportunistic Routing (TOR) protocol that fully exploits the broadcast opportunities on a tree based on novel forwarder selection and coordination rules, and 4) a distributed admission control algorithm that ensures the voice quality guarantees when admitting new voice streams. ASM has been implemented on a low-power hardware platform and extensively evaluated through experiments on a testbed of 18 nodes.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Michigan State University", "Colorado School of Mines", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Liqun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Liqun", "Guoliang Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Guoliang", "Qi Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Qi", "Limin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Limin"], "pages": 10}
