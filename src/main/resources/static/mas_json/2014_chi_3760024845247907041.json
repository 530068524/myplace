{"title": "FOCUS: enhancing children's engagement in reading by using contextual BCI training sessions.", "fields": ["brain computer interface", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "Reading is an important aspect of a child's development. Reading outcome is heavily dependent on the level of engagement while reading. In this paper, we present FOCUS, an EEG-augmented reading system which monitors a child's engagement level in real time, and provides contextual BCI training sessions to improve a child's reading engagement. A laboratory experiment was conducted to assess the validity of the system. Results showed that FOCUS could significantly improve engagement in terms of both EEG-based measurement and teachers' subjective measure on the reading outcome.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jin Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jin", "Chun Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Chun", "Yuntao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuntao", "Yuhang Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yuhang", "Siqi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Siqi", "Chou Mo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mo:Chou", "Jie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jie", "Lie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lie", "Yuanchun Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Yuanchun"], "pages": 4}
