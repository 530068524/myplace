The packets usually follow the shortest paths between sources and destinations in routing protocols to achieve smallest traveled distance. However, this leads to the uneven distribution of traffic load in a network. For example, wireless nodes in the center of the network will have heavier traffic since most of the shortest routes go through them. In this paper, we first describe a novel routing method, called circular sailing routing (CSR), which can distribute the traffic more evenly in the network. The proposed method first maps the network onto a sphere via a simple stereographic projection, and then the route decision is made by the distance on the sphere instead of the Euclidean distance in the plane. We theoretically prove that for a network the distance traveled by the packets using CSR is no more than a small constant factor of the minimum (the distance of the shortest path). We then extend CSR to a localized version, Localized CSR, by modifying the greedy routing without any additional communication overhead. Finally, we further propose CSR protocols for 3D networks where nodes are distributed in a 3D space instead of a 2D plane. For all proposed methods, we conduct simulations to study their performances and compare them with global shortest path routing or greedy routing.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["Fan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Fan", "Yu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Yu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
