{"title": "Randomly supported independence and resistance.", "fields": ["distribution function", "predicate", "unique games conjecture", "constraint satisfaction", "boolean domain", "integer", "binary logarithm", "cardinality"], "abstract": "We prove that for any positive integers $q$ and $k$ there is a constant $c_{q,k}$ such that a uniformly random set of $c_{q,k}n^k\\log n$ vectors in $[q]^n$ with high probability supports a balanced $k$-wise independent distribution. In the case of $k\\leq2$ a more elaborate argument gives the stronger bound, $c_{q,k}n^k$. Using a recent result by Austrin and Mossel, this shows that a predicate on $t$ bits, chosen at random among predicates accepting $c_{q,2}t^2$ input vectors, is, assuming the unique games conjecture, likely to be approximation resistant. These results are close to tight: we show that there are other constants, $c_{q,k}'$, such that a randomly selected set of cardinality $c_{q,k}'n^k$ points is unlikely to support a balanced $k$-wise independent distribution and, for some $c>0$, a random predicate accepting $ct^2/\\log t$ input vectors is nontrivially approximable with high probability. In a different application of the result of Austrin and Mossel we prove that, again assuming the unique games conjecture, any predicate on $t$ Boolean inputs accepting at least $(32/33)\\cdot2^t$ inputs is approximation resistant. The results extend from balanced distributions to arbitrary product distributions.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology", "austrin@cs.toronto.edu", "johanh@kth.se"], "authors": ["Per Austrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Austrin:Per", "Johan H\u00e5stad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=aring=stad:Johan"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
