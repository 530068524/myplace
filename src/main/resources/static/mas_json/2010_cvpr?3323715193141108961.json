In this paper, we derive an efficient filtering algorithm for tracking human pose using a stream of monocular depth images. The key idea is to combine an accurate generative model \u2014 which is achievable in this setting using programmable graphics hardware \u2014 with a discriminative model that provides data-driven evidence about body part locations. In each filter iteration, we apply a form of local model-based search that exploits the nature of the kinematic chain. As fast movements and occlusion can disrupt the local search, we utilize a set of discriminatively trained patch classifiers to detect body parts. We describe a novel algorithm for propagating this noisy evidence about body part locations up the kinematic chain using the un-scented transform. The resulting distribution of body configurations allows us to reinitialize the model-based search. We provide extensive experimental results on 28 real-world sequences using automatic ground-truth annotations from a commercial motion capture system.", "citation": "Citations (413)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Varun Ganapathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganapathi:Varun", "Christian Plagemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plagemann:Christian", "Daphne Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Daphne", "Sebastian Thrun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thrun:Sebastian"], "pages": 8}
