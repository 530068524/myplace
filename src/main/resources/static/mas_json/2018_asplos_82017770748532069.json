{"title": "Unconventional Parallelization of Nondeterministic Applications.", "fields": ["real time computing", "compiler", "nondeterministic algorithm", "parallel computing", "boosting"], "abstract": "The demand for thread-level-parallelism (TLP) on commodity processors is endless as it is essential for gaining performance and saving energy. However, TLP in today's programs is limited by dependences that must be satisfied at run time. We have found that for nondeterministic programs, some of these actual dependences can be satisfied with alternative data that can be generated in parallel, thus boosting the program's TLP. Satisfying these dependences with alternative data nonetheless produces final outputs that match those of the original nondeterministic program. To demonstrate the practicality of our technique, we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of our compilers, autotuner, profiler, and runtime, which are enabled by our proposed C++ programming language extensions. The resulting system boosts the performance of six well-known nondeterministic and multi-threaded benchmarks by 158.2% (geometric mean) on a 28-core Intel-based platform.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Enrico Armenio Deiana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deiana:Enrico_Armenio", "Vincent St-Amour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/St=Amour:Vincent", "Peter A.
