This learning problem can be expressed as an optimization problem involving a low-rank Hankel matrix that represents the inputoutput operator model. The direct outcome of our work is a new spectral regularization method for max-margin structured prediction. Our experiments confirm that our proposed regularization framework leads to an effective way of controlling the capacity of structured prediction models.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "McGill University", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ariadna Quattoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quattoni:Ariadna", "Borja Balle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balle:Borja", "Xavier Carreras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carreras:Xavier", "Amir Globerson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Globerson:Amir"], "pages": 9}
