{"title": "Video-Mediated Peer Support in an Online Community for Recovery from Substance Use Disorders.", "fields": ["computer assisted web interviewing", "constructive", "peer support", "online community", "online health communities"], "abstract": "People in recovery from substance use disorders seek peer support through online health communities like InTheRooms.com (ITR). This community provides the unique opportunity to study video-mediated health peer support online, as it hosts over 100 weekly video meetings for fellowships like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). We describe two synergistic investigations of participants' use, perceptions, and tensions around video meetings on ITR: an online questionnaire, and in-depth inter-views with active site members. We discuss four themes that may be important to other peer-support health communities: opportunities for video-mediated support, synergy with face-to-face contact, challenge of transparency of norms, and the importance of constructive moderation.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Sabirat Rubya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubya:Sabirat", "Svetlana Yarosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yarosh:Svetlana"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 16}
