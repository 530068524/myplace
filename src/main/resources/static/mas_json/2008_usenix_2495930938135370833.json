{"title": "Protection Strategies for Direct Access to Virtualized I/O Devices.", "fields": ["hypervisor", "memory management", "virtualization", "memory management unit", "reuse"], "abstract": "Commodity virtual machine monitors forbid direct access to I/O devices by untrusted guest operating systems in order to provide protection and sharing. However, both I/O memory management units (IOMMUs) and recently proposed software-based methods can be used to reduce the overhead of I/O virtualization by providing untrusted guest operating systems with safe, direct access to I/O devices. This paper explores the performance and safety tradeoffs of strategies for using these mechanisms.\n\nThe protection strategies presented in this paper provide equivalent inter-guest protection among operating system instances. However, they provide varying levels of intra-guest protection from driver software and incur varying levels of overhead. A simple direct-map strategy incurs the least overhead, providing native-level performance but offering no enhanced protection from misbehaving device drivers within the guest operating system. Additional protection against guest drivers can be achieved by limiting IOMMU page-table mappings to memory buffers that are actually used in I/O transfers. Furthermore, the cost incurred by this limitation can be minimized by aggressively reusing these mappings. Surprisingly, a software-only strategy that does not use an IOMMU at all performs competitively, and sometimes better than, hardware-based strategies while maintaining strict inter-guest isolation.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Paul Willmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willmann:Paul", "Scott Rixner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rixner:Scott", "Alan L.
