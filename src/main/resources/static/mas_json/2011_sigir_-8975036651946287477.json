{"title": "A site oriented method for segmenting web pages.", "fields": ["static web page", "link analysis", "market segmentation", "web search query", "site map"], "abstract": "Information about how to segment a Web page can be used nowadays by applications such as segment aware Web search, classification and link analysis. In this research, we propose a fully automatic method for page segmentation and evaluate its application through experiments with four separate Web sites. While the method may be used in other applications, our main focus in this article is to use it as input to segment aware Web search systems. Our results indicate that the proposed method produces better segmentation results when compared to the best segmentation method we found in literature. Further, when applied as input to a segment aware Web search method, it produces results close to those produced when using a manual page segmentation method.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Fed.
