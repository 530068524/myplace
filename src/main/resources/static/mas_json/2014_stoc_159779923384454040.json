Informally, a code is non-malleable if the message contained in a modified codeword is either the original message, or a completely unrelated value. Although such codes do not exist if the family of \"tampering functions\"  F  is completely unrestricted, they are known to exist for many broad tampering families  F . One such natural family is the family of tampering functions in the so called  split-state  model. Here the message  m  is encoded into two shares  L  and  R , and the attacker is allowed to  arbitrarily  tamper with  L  and  R   individually . The split-state tampering arises in many realistic applications, such as the design of  non-malleable secret sharing schemes , motivating the question of designing efficient non-malleable codes in this model.   Prior to this work, non-malleable codes in the splitstate model received considerable attention in the literature, but were constructed either (1) in the random oracle model [16], or (2) relied on advanced cryptographic assumptions (such as non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and leakage-resilient encryption) [26], or (3) could only encode 1-bit messages [14]. As our main result, we build the first efficient, multi-bit, information-theoretically-secure non-malleable code in the split-state model.   The heart of our construction uses the following new property of the inner-product function \u2329 L;R \u232a over the vector space F  n    p   (for a prime  p  and large enough dimension  n ): if  L  and  R  are uniformly random over F  n    p  , and  f, g : F  n    p   \u2192 F  n    p   are two arbitrary functions on  L  and  R , then the joint distribution (\u2329 L;R \u232a, \u2329 f ( L ),  g ( R )\u232a) is \"close\" to the convex combination of \"affine distributions\" {( U, aU  +  b ) ---  a, b  e F  p  }, where  U  is uniformly random in F  p  . In turn, the proof of this surprising property of the inner product function critically relies on some results from additive combinatorics, including the so called  Quasi-polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem  which was recently established by Sanders [29] as a step towards resolving the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture [21].", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "University of California, San Diego", "National University of Singapore", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Divesh Aggarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aggarwal:Divesh", "Yevgeniy Dodis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodis:Yevgeniy", "Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar"], "pages": 10}
