{"title": "Awareness 2.0: staying aware of projects, developers and tasks using dashboards and feeds.", "fields": ["software development", "prioritization", "web 2 0", "dashboard", "ranging"], "abstract": "Software development teams need to maintain awareness of various different aspects ranging from overall project status and process bottlenecks to current tasks and incoming artifacts. Currently, there is a lack of theoretical foundations to guide tool selection and tool design to best support awareness tasks. In this paper, we explore how the combination of highly configurable project, team and contributor dashboards along with individual event feeds is used to accomplish extensive awareness. Our results stem from an empirical study of several large development teams, with a detailed study of a team of 150 developers and additional data from another four project teams. We present how dashboards become pivotal to task prioritization in critical project phases and how they stir competition while feeds are used for short term planning. Our findings indicate that the distinction between high-level and low-level awareness is often unclear and that integrated tooling could improve development practices.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Christoph Treude.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Treude:Christoph", "Margaret-Anne D.
