{"title": "Detecting Vanishing Points Using Global Image Context in a Non-ManhattanWorld.", "fields": ["horizon", "outlier", "vanishing point", "zenith", "orthogonality"], "abstract": "We propose a novel method for detecting horizontal vanishing points and the zenith vanishing point in man-made environments. The dominant trend in existing methods is to first find candidate vanishing points, then remove outliers by enforcing mutual orthogonality. Our method reverses this process: we propose a set of horizon line candidates and score each based on the vanishing points it contains. A key element of our approach is the use of global image context, extracted with a deep convolutional network, to constrain the set of candidates under consideration. Our method does not make a Manhattan-world assumption and can operate effectively on scenes with only a single horizontal vanishing point. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets and achieve state-of the-art performance on each. In addition, our approach is significantly faster than the previous best method.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Kentucky", "University of Kentucky", "University of Kentucky"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Menghua Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Menghua", "Scott Workman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Workman:Scott", "Nathan Jacobs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobs:Nathan"], "pages": 9}
