{"title": "Intrinsic Subspace Evaluation of Word Embedding Representations.", "fields": ["word embedding", "subspace topology", "natural language", "linear subspace", "intrinsic value"], "abstract": "We introduce a new methodology for intrinsic evaluation of word representations. Specifically, we identify four fundamental criteria based on the characteristics of natural language that pose difficulties to NLP systems; and develop tests that directly show whether or not representations contain the subspaces necessary to satisfy these criteria. Current intrinsic evaluations are mostly based on the overall similarity or full-space similarity of words and thus view vector representations as points. We show the limits of these point-based intrinsic evaluations. We apply our evaluation methodology to the comparison of a count vector model and several neural network models and demonstrate important properties of these models.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yaghoobzadeh:Yadollah", "Hinrich Sch\u00fctze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=tze:Hinrich"], "pages": -1}
