We consider the problem of density estimation, in which a learning algorithm is given i.i.d. draws from p and must (with high probability) output a hypothesis distribution that is close to p. The main contribution of this paper is a highly efficient density estimation algorithm for learning using a variable-width histogram, i.e., a hypothesis distribution with a piecewise constant probability density function.\n\nIn more detail, for any k and e, we give an algorithm that makes O(k/e2) draws from p, runs in O(k/e2) time, and outputs a hypothesis distribution h that is piece-wise constant with O(k log2(1/e)) pieces. With high probability the hypothesis h satisfies dTV(p, h) \u2264 C \u00b7 optk (p) + e, where dTV denotes the total variation distance (statistical distance), C is a universal constant, and optk (p) is the smallest total variation distance between p and any k-piecewise constant distribution. The sample size and running time of our algorithm are optimal up to logarithmic factors. The \"approximation factor\" C in our result is inherent in the problem, as we prove that no algorithm with sample size bounded in terms of k and e can achieve C< 2 regardless of what kind of hypothesis distribution it uses.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Edinburgh", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Siu-on Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Siu=on", "Ilias Diakonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakonikolas:Ilias", "Rocco A.
