{"title": "Symbolic reasoning for automatic signal placement.", "fields": ["semantic equivalence", "context switch", "abductive reasoning", "speedup", "thread"], "abstract": "Explicit signaling between threads is a perennial cause of bugs in concurrent programs. While there are several run-time techniques to  automatically  notify threads upon the availability of some shared resource, such techniques are not widely-adopted due to their run-time overhead. This paper proposes a new solution based on static analysis for automatically generating a performant  explicit-signal  program from its corresponding  implicit-signal  implementation. The key idea is to generate verification conditions that allow us to minimize the number of required signals and unnecessary context switches, while guaranteeing semantic equivalence between the source and target programs. We have implemented our method in a tool called Expresso and evaluate it on challenging benchmarks from prior papers and open-source software. Expresso-generated code significantly outperforms past automatic signaling mechanisms (avg. 1.56x speedup) and closely matches the performance of hand-optimized explicit-signal code.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"], "authors": ["Kostas Ferles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferles:Kostas", "Jacob Van Geffen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geffen:Jacob_Van", "Isil Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Isil", "Yannis Smaragdakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smaragdakis:Yannis"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2018", "pages": 15}
