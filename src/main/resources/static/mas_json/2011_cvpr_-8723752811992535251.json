{"title": "AdaBoost on low-rank PSD matrices for metric learning.", "fields": ["content based image retrieval", "metric", "bipartite graph", "adaboost", "boosting"], "abstract": "The problem of learning a proper distance or similarity metric arises in many applications such as content-based image retrieval. In this work, we propose a boosting algorithm, MetricBoost, to learn the distance metric that preserves the proximity relationships among object triplets: object i is more similar to object j than to object k. Metric-Boost constructs a positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix that parameterizes the distance metric by combining rank-one PSD matrices. Different options of weak models and combination coefficients are derived. Unlike existing proximity preserving metric learning which is generally not scalable, MetricBoost employs a bipartite strategy to dramatically reduce computation cost by decomposing proximity relationships over triplets into pair-wise constraints. Met-ricBoost outperforms the state-of-the-art on two real-world medical problems: 1. identifying and quantifying diffuse lung diseases; 2. colorectal polyp matching between different views, as well as on other benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Connecticut", "Princeton University", "Siemens", "University of Florida", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jinbo Bi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bi:Jinbo", "Dijia Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Dijia", "Le Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Le", "Meizhu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Meizhu", "Yimo Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yimo", "Matthias Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf_0001:Matthias"], "pages": 8}
