{"title": "Curated city: capturing individual city guides through social curation.", "fields": ["mental mapping", "social computing", "urban computing", "location based service", "scalability"], "abstract": "We report on our design of Curated City, a website that lets people build their own personal guide to the city's neighborhoods by chronicling their favorite experiences. Although users make their own personal guides, they are immersed in a social curatorial experience where they are influenced directly and indirectly by the guides of others. We use a 2-week field trial involving 20 residents of Pittsburgh as a technological probe to explore the initial design decisions, and we further refine the design landscape through subject interviews. Based on this study, we identify a set of design recommendations for building scalable social platforms for curating the experiences of the city.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of New Mexico", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Justin Cranshaw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cranshaw:Justin", "Kurt Luther.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luther:Kurt", "Patrick Gage Kelley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelley:Patrick_Gage", "Norman M.
