The main contribution of this paper is to show that, alternatively, the optimal state-action value function can be estimated using Difference of Convex functions (DC) Programming. To do so, we study the minimization of a norm of the Optimal Bellman Residual (OBR) T*Q \u2014 Q, where T* is the so-called optimal Bellman operator. Controlling this residual allows controlling the distance to the optimal action-value function, and we show that minimizing an empirical norm of the OBR is consistant in the Vapnik sense. Finally, we frame this optimization problem as a DC program. That allows envisioning using the large related literature on DC Programming to address the Reinforcement Leaning problem.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Institut Universitaire de France"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Bilal Piot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piot:Bilal", "Matthieu Geist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geist:Matthieu", "Olivier Pietquin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietquin:Olivier"], "pages": 9}
