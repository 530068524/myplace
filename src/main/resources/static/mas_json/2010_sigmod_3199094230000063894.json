We describe the query optimization techniques used by graphd, the schema-last, automatically indexed tuple-store which supports freebase.com, a large world-writable database. Graphd is a log-structured store with a query optimizer based on a functional operator tree over the domain of sorted integer sets which accumulate naturally as tuples are appended to the store. We demonstrate that a set-based optimizer can deliver performance that is roughly comparable to traditional RDBMS query optimization techniques applied to a fixed schema.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Metaweb Technol ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Metaweb Technol ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Metaweb Technol ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Metaweb Technol ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Scott M.
