{"title": "Enhancing Pen-based Interaction using Electrovibration and Vibration Haptic Feedback.", "fields": ["haptic technology", "human computer interaction", "electrovibration", "computer science", "vibration"], "abstract": "This paper presents the  EV 2 -Pen  which leverages  electrovibration  technology and  vibration  technology in pen interaction. Electrovibration technology can produce multisensory feedback when the pen is in motion (sliding/moving on the screen), and vibration technology can provide vibrative feedback when the pen is stationary (pointing/resting on the screen). We conducted an experiment to investigate user performance with the EV 2 -Pen. The results indicated that the EV 2 -Pen outperformed the EV-Pen [18, 19] in pointing-steering tasks. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of the EV 2 -Pen, and explore some possible applications and scenarios.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Kochi University of Technology", "Kochi University of Technology", "Jilin University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Qinglong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qinglong", "Xiangshi Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiangshi", "Xiaoying Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Xiaoying"], "pages": 5}
