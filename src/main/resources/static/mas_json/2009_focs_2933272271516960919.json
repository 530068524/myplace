Soon afterwards, Barak, Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Lindell (FOCS 2001) studied the closely related notion of resettable soundness, where the soundness condition of the protocol must hold even if the cheating prover can reset the verifier to have multiple interactions with the same verifier's random tape. The main problem left open by this work was whether it is possible to have a single protocol that is simultaneously resettable zero knowledge and resettably sound. We resolve this question by constructing such a protocol. At the heart of our construction is a new non-black-box simulation strategy, which we believe to be of independent interest. This new strategy allows for simulators which \"marry'' recursive rewinding techniques (common in the context of concurrent simulation) with non-black-box simulation. Previous non-black-box strategies led to exponential blowups in computational complexity in such circumstances, which our new strategy is able to avoid.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Yi Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Yi", "Vipul Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Vipul", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
