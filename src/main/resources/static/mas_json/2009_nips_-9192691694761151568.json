In this framework, SVM and TSVM can be regarded as a learning machine without regularization and one with full regularization from the unlabeled data, respectively. Therefore, to supplement this framework of the regularization strength, it is necessary to introduce data-dependant partial regularization. To this end, we reformulate TSVM into a form with controllable regularization strength, which includes SVM and TSVM as special cases. Furthermore, we introduce a method of adaptive regularization that is data dependant and is based on the smoothness assumption. Experiments on a set of benchmark data sets indicate the promising results of the proposed work compared with state-of-the-art TSVM algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Michigan State University", "ETH Zurich", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zenglin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zenglin", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Jianke Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jianke", "Irwin King.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King:Irwin", "Michael R.
