The purpose of this paper is to provide a unified classification model that includes the above models through a robust optimization approach. This unified model has several benefits. One is that the extensions and improvements intended for SVM become applicable to MPM and FDA, and vice versa. Another benefit is to provide theoretical results to above learning methods at once by dealing with the unified model. We give a statistical interpretation of the unified classification model and propose a non-convex optimization algorithm that can be applied to nonconvex variants of existing learning methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University", "Nagoya University"], "authors": ["Akiko Takeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takeda:Akiko", "Hiroyuki Mitsugi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitsugi:Hiroyuki", "Takafumi Kanamori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanamori:Takafumi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
