We first derive a novel interference model that takes into account both the adjacent channel separation and the physical distance of the two nodes employing adjacent channels. This model defines \u201cnode orthogonality\u201d, which states that two nodes over adjacent channels are orthogonal if they are physically sufficiently separated. We propose an approximate algorithm MICA to minimize the total interference for throughput maximization. Extensive simulation study has been performed to validate our design and to compare the performances of our algorithm with those of the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "George Washington University"], "authors": ["Yong Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui_0001:Yong", "Wei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0059:Wei", "Xiuzhen Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiuzhen"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
