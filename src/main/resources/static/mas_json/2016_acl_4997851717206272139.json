In this paper, we introduce a novel neutral network architecture that benefits from both word- and character-level representations automatically, by using combination of bidirectional LSTM, CNN and CRF. Our system is truly end-to-end, requiring no feature engineering or data preprocessing, thus making it applicable to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks. We evaluate our system on two data sets for two sequence labeling tasks \u2014 Penn Treebank WSJ corpus for part-of-speech (POS) tagging and CoNLL 2003 corpus for named entity recognition (NER). We obtain state-of-the-art performance on both datasets \u2014 97.55% accuracy for POS tagging and 91.21% F1 for NER.", "citation": "Citations (342)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xuezhe Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xuezhe", "Eduard H.
