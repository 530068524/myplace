{"title": "A Boosting Algorithm for Item Recommendation with Implicit Feedback.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "ranking", "ensemble forecasting", "collaborative filtering", "boosting"], "abstract": "Many recommendation tasks are formulated as top-N item recommendation problems based on users' implicit feedback instead of explicit feedback. Here explicit feedback refers to users' ratings to items while implicit feedback is derived from users' interactions with items, e.g., number of times a user plays a song. In this paper, we propose a boosting algorithm named AdaBPR (Adaptive Boosting Personalized Ranking) for top-N item recommendation using users' implicit feedback. In the proposed framework, multiple homogeneous component recommenders are linearly combined to create an ensemble model, for better recommendation accuracy. The component recommenders are constructed based on a fixed collaborative filtering algorithm by using a re-weighting strategy, which assigns a dynamic weight distribution on the observed user-item interactions. AdaBPR demonstrates its effectiveness on three datasets compared with strong baseline algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Yong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yong", "Peilin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Peilin", "Aixin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Aixin", "Chunyan Miao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miao:Chunyan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
