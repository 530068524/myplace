Quality of adaptive streaming depends highly on the accuracy of client's estimation of end-to-end network bandwidth, which is challenging due to LTE link dynamics. In this paper, we present piStream, that allows a client to efficiently monitor the LTE basestation's PHY-layer resource allocation, and then map such information to an estimation of available bandwidth. Given the PHY-informed bandwidth estimation, piStream uses a probabilistic algorithm to balance video quality and the risk of stalling, taking into account the burstiness of LTE downlink traffic loads. We conduct a real-time implementation of piStream on a software-radio tethered to an LTE smartphone. Comparison with state-of-the-art adaptive streaming protocols demonstrates that piStream can effectively utilize the LTE bandwidth, achieving high video quality with minimal stalling rate.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Fudan University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of W ... sconson-Madison", "University of W ... sconson-Madison", "Uber Technologies"], "authors": ["Xiufeng Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Xiufeng", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu", "Swarun Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Swarun", "Li Erran Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Li_Erran"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
