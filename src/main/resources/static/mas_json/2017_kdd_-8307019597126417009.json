{"title": "Effective and Real-time In-App Activity Analysis in Encrypted Internet Traffic Streams.", "fields": ["network packet", "internet traffic engineering", "traffic shaping", "cache", "internet traffic"], "abstract": "The mobile in-App service analysis, aiming at classifying mobile internet traffic into different types of service usages, has become a challenging and emergent task for mobile service providers due to the increasing adoption of secure protocols for in-App services. While some efforts have been made for the classification of mobile internet traffic, existing methods rely on complex feature construction and large storage cache, which lead to low processing speed, and thus not practical for online real-time scenarios. To this end, we develop an iterative analyzer for classifying encrypted mobile traffic in a real-time way. Specifically, we first select an optimal set of most discriminative features from raw features extracted from traffic packet sequences by a novel  M aximizing  I nner activity similarity and  M inimizing  D ifferent activity similarity (MIMD) measurement. To develop the online analyzer, we first represent a traffic flow with a series of time windows, which are described by the optimal feature vector and are updated iteratively at the packet level. Instead of extracting feature elements from a series of raw traffic packets, our feature elements are updated when a new traffic packet is observed and the storage of raw traffic packets is not required. The time windows generated from the same service usage activity are grouped by our proposed method, namely, recursive time continuity constrained KMeans clustering (rCKC). The feature vectors of cluster centers are then fed into a random forest classifier to identify corresponding service usages. Finally, we provide extensive experiments on real-world Internet traffic data from Wechat, Whatsapp, and Facebook to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The results show that the proposed analyzer provides high accuracy in real-world scenarios, and has low storage cache requirement as well as fast processing speed.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Missouri University of Science and Technology", "Rutgers University", "Tsinghua University", "Futurewei Tech. ... ewater, NJ, USA"], "authors": ["Junming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Junming", "Yanjie Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Yanjie", "Jingci Ming.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ming:Jingci", "Yong Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Yong", "Leilei Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Leilei", "Hui Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Hui"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
