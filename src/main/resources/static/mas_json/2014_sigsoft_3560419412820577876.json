{"title": "RefDistiller: a refactoring aware code review tool for inspecting manual refactoring edits.", "fields": ["programming language", "correctness", "software evolution", "code review", "code refactoring"], "abstract": "Manual refactoring edits are error prone, as refactoring requires developers to coordinate related transformations and understand the complex inter-relationship between affected types, methods, and variables. We present RefDistiller, a refactoring-aware code review tool that can help developers detect potential behavioral changes in manual refactoring edits. It first detects the types and locations of refactoring edits by comparing two program versions. Based on the reconstructed refactoring information, it then detects potential anomalies in refactoring edits using two techniques: (1) a template-based checker for detecting missing edits and (2) a refactoring separator for detecting extra edits that may change a program's behavior. By helping developers be aware of deviations from pure refactoring edits, RefDistiller can help developers have high confidence about the correctness of manual refactoring edits. RefDistiller is available as an Eclipse plug-in at https://sites.google.com/site/refdistiller/ and its demonstration video is available at http://youtu.be/0Iseoc5HRpU.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Federal University of Campina Grande", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Everton L.
