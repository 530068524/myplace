{"title": "LCI: a social channel analysis platform for live customer intelligence.", "fields": ["customer intelligence", "sentiment analysis", "dashboard", "social media", "use case"], "abstract": "The rise of Web 2.0 with its increasingly popular social sites like Twitter, Facebook, blogs and review sites has motivated people to express their opinions publicly and more frequently than ever before. This has fueled the emerging field known as sentiment analysis whose goal is to translate the vagaries of human emotion into hard data. LCI is a social channel analysis platform that taps into what is being said to understand the sentiment with the particular ability of doing so in near real-time. LCI integrates novel algorithms for sentiment analysis and a configurable dashboard with different kinds of charts including dynamic ones that change as new data is ingested. LCI has been researched and prototyped at HP Labs in close interaction with the Business Intelligence Solutions (BIS) Division and a few customers. This paper presents an overview of the architecture and some of its key components and algorithms, focusing in particular on how LCI deals with Twitter and illustrating its capabilities with selected use cases.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["HP, Palo Alto, CA, USA", "HP, Palo Alto, USA", "HP, Palo Alto, USA", "HP, Palo Alto, USA", "HP, Palo Alto, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mal\u00fa Castellanos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castellanos:Mal=uacute=", "Umeshwar Dayal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dayal:Umeshwar", "Meichun Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Meichun", "Riddhiman Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Riddhiman", "Mohamed Dekhil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dekhil:Mohamed", "Yue Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yue", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lei", "Mark Schreiman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schreiman:Mark"], "pages": 10}
