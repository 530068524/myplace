{"title": "Ontology-Mediated Queries for NOSQL Databases.", "fields": ["complete information", "ontology", "data access", "nosql", "decidability"], "abstract": "Ontology-Based Data Access has been studied so far for relational structures and deployed on top of relational databases. This paradigm enables a uniform access to heterogeneous data sources, also coping with incomplete information. Whether OBDA is suitable also for non-relational structures, like those shared by increasingly popular NOSQL languages, is still an open question. In this paper, we study the problem of answering ontology-mediated queries on top of key-value stores. We formalize the data model and core queries of these systems, and introduce a rule language to express lightweight ontologies on top of data. We study the decidability and data complexity of query answering in this setting.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Montpellier", "Institut Universitaire de France", "University of Montpellier"], "authors": ["Marie-Laure Mugnier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mugnier:Marie=Laure", "Marie-Christine Rousset.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rousset:Marie=Christine", "Federico Ulliana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ulliana:Federico"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
