In this paper, we propose a crowd-based urban sensing framework that maximizes the coverage of collected data in a spatio-temporal space, based on human mobility of participants recruited by a given budget. This framework provides participants with unobstructed tasks that do not break their original commuting plans, while ensuring a sensing program balanced coverage of data that better supports upper-level applications. The framework consists of three components: 1) an objective function to measure data coverage based on the entropy of data with different spatio-temporal granularities; 2) a graph-based task design algorithm to compute a near-optimal task for each participant, using a dynamic programming strategy; 3) a participant recruitment mechanism to find a portion of participants from candidates for a given budget. We evaluate our framework based on a field study and simulations, finding its advantages beyond baselines.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Southwest Jiaotong University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Southwest Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Shenggong Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Shenggong", "Yu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0004:Yu", "Tianrui Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Tianrui"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
