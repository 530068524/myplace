The basis of this extension is a preconditioning technique that solves a stochastic model equation. This paper also studies three significant issues of the new framework: it presents a new rule of step-size that can be computed online, provides an iterative way to apply preconditioning, and reduces the complexity of related algorithms to near that of temporal difference (TD) learning.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Hengshuai Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Hengshuai", "Zhi-Qiang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhi=Qiang"], "pages": 8}
