Even though these methods have proved useful in several scenarios, their performance is often limited by their bias. In this study, we propose a novel sampling algorithm that aims to reduce the bias of SG-MCMC while keeping the variance at a reasonable level. Our approach is based on a numerical sequence acceleration method, namely the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation, which simply boils down to running almost the same SG-MCMC algorithm twice in parallel with different step sizes. We illustrate our framework on the popular Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm and propose a novel SG-MCMC algorithm referred to as Stochastic Gradient Richardson-Romberg Langevin Dynamics (SGRRLD). We provide formal theoretical analysis and show that SGRRLD is asymptotically consistent, satisfies a central limit theorem, and its non-asymptotic bias and the mean squared-error can be bounded. Our results show that SGRRLD attains higher rates of convergence than SGLD in both finite-time and asymptotically, and it achieves the theoretical accuracy of the methods that are based on higher-order integrators. We support our findings using both synthetic and real data experiments.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com"], "authors": ["Alain Durmus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durmus:Alain", "Umut Simsekli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simsekli:Umut", "Eric Moulines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moulines:Eric", "Roland Badeau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badeau:Roland", "Ga\u00ebl Richard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Richard:Ga=euml=l"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
