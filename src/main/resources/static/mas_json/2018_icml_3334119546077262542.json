{"title": "Submodular Hypergraphs: p-Laplacians, Cheeger Inequalities and Spectral Clustering.", "fields": ["spectral clustering", "inequality", "hypergraph", "constraint graph", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "We introduce submodular hypergraphs, a family of hypergraphs that have different submodular weights associated with different cuts of hyperedges. Submodular hypergraphs arise in clustering applications in which higher-order structures carry relevant information. For such hypergraphs, we define the notion of p-Laplacians and derive corresponding nodal domain theorems and k-way Cheeger inequalities. We conclude with the description of algorithms for computing the spectra of 1- and 2-Laplacians that constitute the basis of new spectral hypergraph clustering methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Pan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Pan", "Olgica Milenkovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milenkovic:Olgica"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
