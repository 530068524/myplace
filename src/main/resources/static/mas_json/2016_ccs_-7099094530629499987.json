{"title": "BeleniosRF: A Non-interactive Receipt-Free Electronic Voting Scheme.", "fields": ["helios", "ballot", "voting", "cardinal voting systems", "electronic voting"], "abstract": "We propose a new voting scheme, BeleniosRF, that offers both receipt-freeness and end-to-end verifiability. It is receipt-free in a strong sense, meaning that even dishonest voters cannot prove how they voted. We provide a game-based definition of receipt-freeness for voting protocols with non-interactive ballot casting, which we name strong receipt-freeness (sRF). To our knowledge, sRF is the first game-based definition of receipt-freeness in the literature, and it has the merit of being particularly concise and simple. Built upon the Helios protocol, BeleniosRF inherits its simplicity and does not require any anti-coercion strategy from the voters. We implement BeleniosRF and show its feasibility on a number of platforms, including desktop computers and smartphones.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University College London", "University of Lorraine", "PSL Research University", "University of Birmingham"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Pyrros Chaidos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaidos:Pyrros", "V\u00e9ronique Cortier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cortier:V=eacute=ronique", "Georg Fuchsbauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuchsbauer:Georg", "David Galindo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galindo:David"], "pages": 12}
