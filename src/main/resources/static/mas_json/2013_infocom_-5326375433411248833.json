{"title": "On interference alignment for multi-hop MIMO networks.", "fields": ["streams", "hop", "mimo", "co channel interference", "3g mimo"], "abstract": "Interference alignment (IA) is a major advance in information theory. Despite its rapid advance in the information theory community, most results on IA remain point-to-point or single-hop and there is a lack of advance of IA in the context of multi-hop wireless networks. The goal of this paper is to make a concrete step toward advancing IA technique in multi-hop MIMO networks. We present an IA model consisting of a set of constraints at a transmitter and a receiver that can be used to determine a subset of interfering streams for IA. Based on this IA model, we develop an IA optimization framework for a multihop MIMO network. For performance evaluation, we compare the performance of a network throughput optimization problem under our proposed IA framework and the same problem when IA is not employed. Simulation results show that the use of IA can significantly decrease the DoF consumption for IC, thereby improving network throughput.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["United States Naval Research Laboratory", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA"], "authors": ["Huacheng Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Huacheng", "Yi Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi_0001:Yi", "Y.
