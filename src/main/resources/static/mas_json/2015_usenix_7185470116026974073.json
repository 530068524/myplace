{"title": "Hawk: Hybrid Datacenter Scheduling.", "fields": ["scheduling", "spark", "workload", "small number", "scalability"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of efficient scheduling of large clusters under high load and heterogeneous workloads. A heterogeneous workload typically consists of many short jobs and a small number of large jobs that consume the bulk of the cluster's resources.\n\nRecent work advocates distributed scheduling to overcome the limitations of centralized schedulers for large clusters with many competing jobs. Such distributed schedulers are inherently scalable, but may make poor scheduling decisions because of limited visibility into the overall resource usage in the cluster. In particular, we demonstrate that under high load, short jobs can fare poorly with such a distributed scheduler.\n\nWe propose instead a new hybrid centralized/ distributed scheduler, called Hawk. In Hawk, long jobs are scheduled using a centralized scheduler, while short ones are scheduled in a fully distributed way. Moreover, a small portion of the cluster is reserved for the use of short jobs. In order to compensate for the occasional poor decisions made by the distributed scheduler, we propose a novel and efficient randomized work-stealing algorithm.\n\nWe evaluate Hawk using a trace-driven simulation and a prototype implementation in Spark. In particular, using a Google trace, we show that under high load, compared to the purely distributed Sparrow scheduler, Hawk improves the 50th and 90th percentile runtimes by 80% and 90% for short jobs and by 35% and 10% for long jobs, respectively. Measurements of a prototype implementation using Spark on a 100-node cluster confirm the results of the simulation.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Pamela Delgado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delgado:Pamela", "Florin Dinu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinu:Florin", "Anne-Marie Kermarrec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kermarrec:Anne=Marie", "Willy Zwaenepoel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwaenepoel:Willy"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
