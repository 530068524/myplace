A lighting control agent is proposed that uses spatial context retrieved from a space model, as well as other context data, to address the challenges of personalized lighting control. Benefits include improved user satisfaction, productivity and minimized energy use. A user scenario is presented to illustrate the envisioned concept of personalized lighting control. Requirements are derived from this and related scenarios. A system design is proposed that meets these requirements. A first version of a system prototype has been implemented and validated against the user scenario.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Filip Petrushevski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrushevski:Filip"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
