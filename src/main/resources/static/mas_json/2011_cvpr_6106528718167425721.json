More precisely, in the proposed STuMs the weights parameters are regarded to be a tensor, calculated according to the Tucker tensor decomposition as the multiplication of a core tensor with a set of matrices, one along each mode. We further extend the proposed STuMs to the \u03a3/\u03a3 w  STuMs, in order to fully exploit the information offered by the total or the within-class covariance matrix and whiten the data, thus providing in-variance to affine transformations in the feature space. We formulate the two above mentioned problems in such a way that they can be solved in an iterative manner, where at each iteration the parameters corresponding to the projections along a single tensor mode are estimated by solving a typical Support Vector Machine-type problem. The superiority of the proposed methods in terms of classification accuracy is illustrated on the problems of gait and action recognition.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Irene Kotsia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotsia:Irene", "Ioannis Patras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patras:Ioannis"], "pages": 8}
