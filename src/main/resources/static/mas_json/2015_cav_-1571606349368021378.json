Using PVSio-web, one can generate and evaluate realistic interactive prototypes from formal models. PVSio-web has been successfully used over the last two years for analyzing commercial, safety-critical medical devices. It has been used to create training material for device developers and device users. It has also been used for medical device design, by both formal methods experts and non-technical end users.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Swansea University", "Food and Drug Administration", "Food and Drug Administration", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Paolo Masci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masci:Paolo", "Patrick Oladimeji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oladimeji:Patrick", "Yi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yi", "Paul L.
