Since the Web service QoS information collection work requires much time and effort, and is sometimes even impractical, the service QoS value is usually missing. There are some work to predict the missing QoS value using traditional collaborative filtering methods based on  user-service  static model. However, the QoS value is highly related to the invocation context (e.g., QoS value are various at different time). By considering the third dynamic context information, a Temporal QoS-aware Web Service Recommendation Framework is presented to predict missing QoS value under various temporal context. Further, we formalize this problem as a generalized tensor factorization model and propose a Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) algorithm which is able to deal with the triadic relations of  user-service-time  model. Extensive experiments are conducted based on our real-world Web service QoS dataset collected on Planet-Lab, which is comprised of service invocation response-time and throughput value from 343 users on 5817 Web services at 32 time periods. The comprehensive experimental analysis shows that our approach achieves better prediction accuracy than other approaches.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University"], "authors": ["Wancai Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wancai", "Hailong Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Hailong", "Xudong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xudong", "Xiaohui Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Xiaohui"], "conf": "www", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
