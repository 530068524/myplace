All results in this entire line of work share the common restriction that they only hold under the assumption that the round keys k0,\u2026,k r and the permutations P1,\u2026,P r are independent. In particular, for two rounds, the current state of knowledge is that the block cipher E(x) = k2 \u2295 P2(k1 \u2295 P1(k0 \u2295 x)) is provably secure up to \\( \\mathcal{O} (2^{2n/3})\\) queries of the adversary, when k0, k1, and k2 are three independent n-bit keys, and P1 and P2 are two independent random n-bit permutations. In this paper, we ask whether one can obtain a similar bound for the two-round Even-Mansour cipher from just one n-bit key and one n-bit permutation. Our answer is positive: when the three n-bit round keys k0, k1, and k2 are adequately derived from an n-bit master key k, and the same permutation P is used in place of P1 and P2, we prove a qualitatively similar \\( \\widetilde{ \\mathcal{O} } (2^{2n/3})\\) security bound (in the random permutation model). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first \u201cbeyond the birthday bound\u201d security result for AES-like ciphers that does not assume independent round keys.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Sejong University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "University of Versailles", "ANSSI", "University of Versailles", "ANSSI"], "authors": ["Shan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shan", "Rodolphe Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Rodolphe", "Jooyoung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Jooyoung", "Yannick Seurin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seurin:Yannick", "John P.
