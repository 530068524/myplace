Aiming to improve both time and space efficiency of the conventional SAH-based kd-tree in ray tracing, we propose to use an extended kd-tree representation for which an effective tree-construction algorithm is provided. Our experiments with several test scenes revealed that the presented kd-tree scheme significantly reduced the memory requirement for representing the tree structure, while also increasing the overall frame rate for rendering.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Sogang University", "Sogang University", "Sogang University"], "authors": ["Byeongjun Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Byeongjun", "Woong Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Woong", "Insung Ihm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ihm:Insung"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
