However, such formulations are both complex and slow, making them unsuitable for video applications. This paper proposes GMS (Grid-based Motion Statistics), a simple means of encapsulating motion smoothness as the statistical likelihood of a certain number of matches in a region. GMS enables translation of high match numbers into high match quality. This provides a real-time, ultra-robust correspondence system. Evaluation on videos, with low textures, blurs and wide-baselines show GMS consistently out-performs other real-time matchers and can achieve parity with more sophisticated, much slower techniques.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oxford Brookes University", "Osaka University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jiawang Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Jiawang", "Wen-Yan Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Wen=Yan", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki", "Sai-Kit Yeung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeung:Sai=Kit", "Tan-Dat Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tan=Dat", "Ming-Ming Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Ming=Ming"], "pages": 10}
