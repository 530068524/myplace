{"title": "Reconsidering Nature: The Dialectics of Fair Chase in the Practices of American Midwest Hunters.", "fields": ["ethos", "dialectic", "multimedia", "ethnography", "social science"], "abstract": "In this paper, we describe an ethnographic study consisting of 14 interviews with hunters and participant observations in the American Midwest. We find that the ethos of \"fair chase\" serves to unite an eclectic group of hunters under a single moral compass. Fair chase posits, for example, that hunters must not have an improper advantage over animals. The actual practices of hunters in different communities (e.g., communities revolving around different weapons or professions), however, reveals a series of opposing points of view among hunters at large on what actually constitutes fair chase. We suggest that an understanding of fair chase and its dialectics can constructively problematize nature for human-computer interaction.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Norman Makoto Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Norman_Makoto", "EunJeong Cheon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheon:EunJeong"], "pages": 12}
