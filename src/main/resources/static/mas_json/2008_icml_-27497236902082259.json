This problem can arise, for instance, when training data is aggregated from multiple sources, and some sources record only a subset of attributes. We derive a generic joint optimization problem in which the distribution governing the missing values is a free parameter. We show that the optimal solution concentrates the density mass on finitely many imputations, and provide a corresponding algorithm for learning from incomplete data. We report on empirical results on benchmark data, and on the email spam application that motivates our work.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Uwe Dick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dick:Uwe", "Peter Haider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haider:Peter", "Tobias Scheffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheffer:Tobias"], "pages": 8}
