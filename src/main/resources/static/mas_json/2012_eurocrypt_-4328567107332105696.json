The focal point of our work is a new abstraction that we call Detectable Chosen Ciphertext Security (DCCA). Intuitively, this notion is meant to capture systems that are not necessarily chosen ciphertext attack (CCA) secure, but where we can detect whether a certain query CT can be useful for decrypting (or distinguishing) a challenge ciphertext CT*.\n\nWe show how to build chosen ciphertext secure systems from DCCA security. We motivate our techniques by describing multiple examples of DCCA systems including creating them from 1-bit CCA secure encryption -- capturing the recent Myers-shelat result (FOCS 2009). Our work identifies DCCA as a new target for building CCA secure systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Susan Hohenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hohenberger:Susan", "Allison B.
