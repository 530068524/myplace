We first use symbolic fixpoint computations to derive conditions on the incoming messages and relations among the incoming and outgoing messages of individual BPEL web services. These pre- and post-conditions are accumulated and serve as a repository of summarizations of individual web services. We then compose the summaries of the invoked BPEL services to model external invocations, resulting in a scalable verification approach for web service compositions. Our technical contributions include (1) an efficient symbolic encoding for modeling the concurrency semantics of systems having both multi-threading and message passing, and (2) a scalable method for summarizing concurrent processes that interact with each other using synchronous message passing, along with a modular framework that utilizes these summaries for scalable verification.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "NEC Laboratories America", "NEC Laboratories America"], "authors": ["Fang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Fang", "Chao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Chao", "Aarti Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Aarti", "Tevfik Bultan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bultan:Tevfik"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2008", "pages": 11}
