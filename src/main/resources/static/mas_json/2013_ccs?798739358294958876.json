{"title": "Control-Alt-Hack: the design and evaluation of a card game for computer security awareness and education.", "fields": ["multimedia", "recreation", "internet privacy", "outreach", "security awareness"], "abstract": "We scoped, designed, produced, and evaluated the effectiveness of a recreational tabletop card game created to raise awareness of and alter perceptions regarding-computer security. We discuss our process, the challenges that arose, and the decisions we made to address those challenges. As of May 2013, we have shipped approximately 800 free copies to 150 educators. We analyze and report on feedback from 22 of these educators about their experiences using Control-Alt-Hack with over 450 students in classroom and non-classroom contexts. The responses from the 14 educators who reported on their use of the game in a classroom context variously indicated that: their students' awareness of computer security as a complex and interesting field was increased (11/14); they would use the game again in their classroom (10/14); and they would recommend the game to others (13/14). Of note, 2 of the 14 classroom educators reported that they would not have otherwise covered the material. Additionally, we present results from user studies with 11 individuals and find that their responses indicate that 8 of the 11 had an increased awareness of computer security or a changed perception; furthermore, all of our intended goals are touched upon in their responses.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Adam Shostack,  ... eattle, WA, USA"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Tamara Denning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denning:Tamara", "Adam Lerner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerner:Adam", "Adam Shostack.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shostack:Adam", "Tadayoshi Kohno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohno:Tadayoshi"], "pages": 14}
