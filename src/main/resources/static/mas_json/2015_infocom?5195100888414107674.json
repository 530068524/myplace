Differently from the existing SDN solutions for wireless sensor networks, SDN-WISE is stateful and pursues two objectives: (i) to reduce the amount of information exchanged between sensor nodes and the SDN network controller, and (ii) to make sensor nodes programmable as finite state machines so enabling them to run operations that cannot be supported by stateless solutions. A detailed description of SDN-WISE is provided in this paper. SDN-WISE offers APIs that allow software developers to implement the SDN Controller using the programming language they prefer. This represents a major advantage of SDN-WISE as compared to existing solutions because it increases flexibility and simplicity in network programming. A prototype of SDN-WISE has been implemented and is described in this paper. Such implementation contains the modules that allow a real SDN Controller to manage an OMNeT++ simulated network. Finally, the paper illustrates the results obtained through an experimental testbed which has been developed to evaluate the performance of SDN-WISE in several operating conditions.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "departments": ["University of Catania", "University of Catania", "University of Catania", "CNIT Research U ...
