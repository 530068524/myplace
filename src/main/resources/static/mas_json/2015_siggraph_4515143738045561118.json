While this is straightforward for computer generated scenes, photographic VR content generally does not provide motion parallax in response to head motion. Even 360\u00b0 stereo panoramas, which offer separated left and right views, fail to allow the vantage point to change in response to head motion.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["OTOY, Inc. and  ... ve Technologies", "xRez, Inc.", "USC Institute f ... ve Technologies", "OTOY, Inc.", "OTOY, Inc."], "authors": ["Paul E.
