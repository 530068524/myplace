In this paper, we explore how ontological knowledge expressed via existential rules can be combined with CP-theories to (i) represent qualitative preferences along with domain knowledge, and (ii) perform preference-based answering of conjunctive queries (CQs). We call these combinations ontological CP-theories (OCP-theories). We define skyline and k-rank answers to CQs based on the user's preferences encoded in an OCP-theory, and provide an algorithm for computing them. We also provide precise complexity (including data tractability) results for deciding consistency, dominance, and CQ skyline membership for OCP-theories.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional", "University of Oxford", "National Scientific and Technical Research Council", "National Scientific and Technical Research Council", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Tommaso Di Noia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noia:Tommaso_Di", "Thomas Lukasiewicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lukasiewicz:Thomas", "Maria Vanina Mart\u00ednez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mart=iacute=nez:Maria_Vanina", "Gerardo I.
