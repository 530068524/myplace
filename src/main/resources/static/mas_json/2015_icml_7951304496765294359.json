{"title": "Learning to Search Better than Your Teacher.", "fields": ["data mining", "machine learning", "search algorithm", "structured prediction", "regret"], "abstract": "Methods for learning to search for structured prediction typically imitate a reference policy, with existing theoretical guarantees demonstrating low regret compared to that reference. This is unsatisfactory in many applications where the reference policy is suboptimal and the goal of learning is to improve upon it. Can learning to search work even when the reference is poor?\n\nWe provide a new learning to search algorithm, LOLS, which does well relative to the reference policy, but additionally guarantees low regret compared to deviations from the learned policy: a local-optimality guarantee. Consequently, LOLS can improve upon the reference policy, unlike previous algorithms. This enables us to develop structured contextual bandits, a partial information structured prediction setting with many potential applications.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Kai-Wei Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kai=Wei", "Akshay Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Akshay", "Alekh Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Alekh", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal", "John Langford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langford_0001:John"], "pages": 9}
