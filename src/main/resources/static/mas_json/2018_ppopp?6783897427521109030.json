{"title": "Reducing the burden of parallel loop schedulers for many-core processors.", "fields": ["scheduling", "concurrency", "cilk", "speedup", "thread"], "abstract": "This work proposes a low-overhead half-barrier pattern to schedule fine-grain parallel loops and considers its integration in the Intel OpenMP and Cilkplus schedulers. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the scheduling overhead of our techniques is 43% lower than Intel OpenMP and 12.1x lower than Cilk. We observe 22% speedup on 48 threads, with a peak of 2.8x speedup.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Queen's University Belfast", "Queen's University Belfast"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Mahwish Arif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arif:Mahwish", "Hans Vandierendonck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vandierendonck:Hans"], "pages": 2}
