The limit of manipulating objects in a two-dimensional graphical display is where each pixel is an independent object. These two observations motivate the development of  calligraphic video , textures that can be manipulated by the user using intuitions about physical material such as water, ink, or smoke. We argue for a phenomenological approach to complex visual interaction based on corporeal kinesthetic intuition, and provide an effective way to provide such texture-based interaction using computational physics. A motivating application is to create palpable, highly textured video that can be projected as structured light fields in responsive environments.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Concordia University"], "authors": ["Sha Xin Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Sha_Xin", "Michael Fortin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fortin:Michael", "Jean-S\u00e9bastien Rousseau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rousseau:Jean=S=eacute=bastien"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
