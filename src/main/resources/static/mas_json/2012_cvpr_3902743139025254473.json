Our approach combines robust spatial regularization with spatially and temporally global occlusion labeling in a variational, Lagrangian framework with subspace constraints. We track points even through ephemeral occlusions. Experiments demonstrate accuracy superior to the state of the art while tracking more points through more frames.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Susanna Ricco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ricco:Susanna", "Carlo Tomasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomasi:Carlo"], "pages": 8}
