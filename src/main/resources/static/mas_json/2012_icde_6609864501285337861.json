{"title": "BestPeer++: A Peer-to-Peer Based Large-Scale Data Processing Platform.", "fields": ["peer to peer", "server", "data management", "data processing system", "benchmarking"], "abstract": "The corporate network is often used for sharing information among the participating companies and facilitating collaboration in a certain industry sector where companies share a common interest. It can effectively help the companies to reduce their operational costs and increase the revenues. However, the inter-company data sharing and processing poses unique challenges to such a data management system including scalability, performance, throughput, and security. In this paper, we present Best Peer++, a system which delivers elastic data sharing services for corporate network applications in the cloud based on Best Peer -- a peer-to-peer (P2P) based data management platform. By integrating cloud computing, database, and P2P technologies into one system, Best Peer++ provides an economical, flexible and scalable platform for corporate network applications and delivers data sharing services to participants based on the widely accepted pay-as-you-go business model. We evaluate Best Peer++ on Amazon EC2 Cloud platform. The benchmarking results show that Best Peer++ outperforms Hadoop DB, a recently proposed large-scale data processing system, in performance when both systems are employed to handle typical corporate network workloads. The benchmarking results also demonstrate that Best Peer++ achieves near linear scalability for throughput with respect to the number of peer nodes.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Gang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Gang", "Tianlei Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Tianlei", "Dawei Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Dawei", "Peng Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Peng", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee", "Hoang Tam Vo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vo:Hoang_Tam", "Sai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Sai"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
