{"title": "Protecting Bare-Metal Embedded Systems with Privilege Overlays.", "fields": ["code injection", "compiler", "internet of things", "memory management", "overlay"], "abstract": "Embedded systems are ubiquitous in every aspect ofmodern life. As the Internet of Thing expands, our dependenceon these systems increases. Many of these interconnected systemsare and will be low cost bare-metal systems, executing without anoperating system. Bare-metal systems rarely employ any securityprotection mechanisms and their development assumptions (un-restricted access to all memory and instructions), and constraints(runtime, energy, and memory) makes applying protectionschallenging. To address these challenges we present EPOXY, an LLVM-based embedded compiler. We apply a novel technique, calledprivilege overlaying, wherein operations requiring privilegedexecution are identified and only these operations execute inprivileged mode. This provides the foundation on which code-integrity, adapted control-flow hijacking defenses, and protections for sensitive IO are applied. We also design fine-grainedrandomization schemes, that work within the constraints of bare-metal systems to provide further protection against control-flowand data corruption attacks. These defenses prevent code injection attacks and ROP attacksfrom scaling across large sets of devices. We evaluate theperformance of our combined defense mechanisms for a suite of75 benchmarks and 3 real-world IoT applications. Our results forthe application case studies show that EPOXY has, on average, a 1.8% increase in execution time and a 0.5% increase in energy usage.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Abraham A.
