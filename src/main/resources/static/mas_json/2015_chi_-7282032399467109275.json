After alcohol-dependent patients complete alcohol withdrawal treatment and return to their regular lives, they face further challenges in order to maintain sobriety. This study proposes SoberDiary, a phone-based support system that enables alcohol-dependent patients to self-monitor and self-manage their own alcohol use behavior and remain sober in their daily lives. Results from a 4-week user study involving 11 clinical patients show that, using SoberDiary, patients can self-monitor and self-manage their alcohol use behavior, reducing their total alcohol consumption and the number of drinking or heavy drinking days that occur following intervention.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "Taipei City Hos ... pei, Taiwan Roc"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chuang-Wen You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Chuang=Wen", "Kuo-Cheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kuo=Cheng", "Ming-Chyi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ming=Chyi", "Yen-Chang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yen=Chang", "Cheng-Lin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Cheng=Lin", "Po-Shiun Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Po=Shiun", "Hao-Chuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hao=Chuan", "Polly Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Polly", "Hao-Hua Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Hao=Hua"], "pages": 10}
