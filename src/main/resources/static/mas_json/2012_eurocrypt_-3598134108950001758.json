We also obtain the first examples of IND-CPA encryption schemes that are not secure under SOA, both for sender corruptions where encryption coins are revealed and receiver corruptions where decryption keys are revealed. These results assume only the existence of collision-resistant hash functions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of St. Thomas"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Rafael Dowsley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dowsley:Rafael", "Brent Waters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waters:Brent", "Scott Yilek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yilek:Scott"], "pages": 18}
