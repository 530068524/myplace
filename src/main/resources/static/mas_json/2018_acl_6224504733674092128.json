With the availability of large annotated data, it has recently become feasible to train complex models such as neural-network-based inference models, which have shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Although there exist relatively large annotated data, can machines learn all knowledge needed to perform natural language inference (NLI) from these data? If not, how can neural-network-based NLI models benefit from external knowledge and how to build NLI models to leverage it? In this paper, we enrich the state-of-the-art neural natural language inference models with external knowledge. We demonstrate that the proposed models improve neural NLI models to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the SNLI and MultiNLI datasets.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Queen's University", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Ottawa", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Diana Inkpen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inkpen:Diana", "Xiaodan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaodan", "Zhen-Hua Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Zhen=Hua", "Qian Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qian", "Si Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Si"], "pages": 12}
