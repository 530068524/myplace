{"title": "Learning a blind measure of perceptual image quality.", "fields": ["transform coding", "image texture", "feature", "feature detection", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "It is often desirable to evaluate an image based on its quality. For many computer vision applications, a perceptually meaningful measure is the most relevant for evaluation; however, most commonly used measure do not map well to human judgements of image quality. A further complication of many existing image measure is that they require a reference image, which is often not available in practice. In this paper, we present a \u201cblind\u201d image quality measure, where potentially neither the groundtruth image nor the degradation process are known. Our method uses a set of novel low-level image features in a machine learning framework to learn a mapping from these features to subjective image quality scores. The image quality features stem from natural image measure and texture statistics. Experiments on a standard image quality benchmark dataset shows that our method outperforms the current state of art.", "citation": "Citations (212)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Huixuan Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Huixuan", "Neel Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi:Neel", "Ashish Kapoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapoor:Ashish"], "pages": 8}
