{"title": "Multimodal Graph-based Event Detection and Summarization in Social Media Streams.", "fields": ["sliding window protocol", "clustering coefficient", "social media", "ranking", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "The paper describes a multimodal graph-based system for addressing the Yahoo-Flickr Event Summarization Challenge of ACM Multimedia 2015. The objective is to automatically uncover structure within a collection of 100 million photos/videos in the form of detecting and identifying events, and summarizing them succinctly for consumer consumption. The presented system uses a sliding window over the stream of multimedia items to build and maintain a multimodal same-event image graph and applies a graph clustering algorithm to detect events. In addition, it makes use of a graph-based diversity-oriented ranking approach and a versatile event retrieval mechanism to access summarized instances of the events of interest. A demo of the system is online at http://mklab.iti.gr/acmmm2015-gc/.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Aristotle University of Thessaloniki", "Information Tec ... aloniki, Greece", "Information Tec ... aloniki, Greece", "Information Tec ... aloniki, Greece", "Information Tec ... aloniki, Greece"], "authors": ["Manos Schinas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schinas:Manos", "Symeon Papadopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadopoulos:Symeon", "Georgios Petkos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petkos:Georgios", "Yiannis Kompatsiaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kompatsiaris:Yiannis", "Pericles A.
