We address the design of fast approximation algorithms for the NFV service distribution problem (NSDP), whose goal is to determine the placement of VNFs, the routing of service flows, and the associated allocation of cloud and network resources that satisfy client demands with minimum cost. We show that in the case of load-proportional costs, the resulting fractional NSDP can be formulated as a multi-commodity-chain flow problem on a cloud-augmented graph, and design a queue-length based algorithm, named QNSD, that provides an O(e) approximation in time O (1/e). We then address the case in which resource costs are a function of the integer number of allocated resources and design a variation of QNSD that effectively pushes for flow consolidation into a limited number of active resources to minimize overall cloud network cost.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Hao Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng_0002:Hao", "Jaime Llorca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Llorca:Jaime", "Antonia Maria Tulino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tulino:Antonia_Maria", "Danny Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Danny", "Andreas F.
