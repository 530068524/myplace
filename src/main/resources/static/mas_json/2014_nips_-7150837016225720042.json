Some notable studies have been carried out regarding the behavior of these methods for infinitely large sample size (von Luxburg et al., 2008; Rohe et al., 2011), which provide sufficient confidence to practitioners about the effectiveness of these methods. On the other hand, recent developments in computer vision have led to a plethora of applications, where the model deals with multi-way affinity relations and can be posed as uniform hypergraphs. In this paper, we view these models as random m-uniform hypergraphs and establish the consistency of spectral algorithm in this general setting. We develop a planted partition model or stochastic blockmodel for such problems using higher order tensors, present a spectral technique suited for the purpose and study its large sample behavior. The analysis reveals that the algorithm is consistent for m-uniform hypergraphs for larger values of m, and also the rate of convergence improves for increasing m. Our result provides the first theoretical evidence that establishes the importance of m-way affinities.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Debarghya Ghoshdastidar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghoshdastidar:Debarghya", "Ambedkar Dukkipati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dukkipati:Ambedkar"], "pages": 9}
