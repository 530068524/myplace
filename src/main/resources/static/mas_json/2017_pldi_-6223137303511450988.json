Massive parallelism brings significant correctness challenges by increasing the possibility for bugs as the number of thread interleavings balloons. Conventional dynamic safety analyses struggle to run at this scale.     We present BARRACUDA, a concurrency bug detector for GPU programs written in Nvidia\u2019s CUDA language. BARRACUDA handles a wider range of parallelism constructs than previous work, including branch operations, low-level atomics and memory fences, which allows BARRACUDA to detect new classes of concurrency bugs. BARRACUDA operates at the binary level for increased compatibility with existing code, leveraging a new binary instrumentation framework that is extensible to other dynamic analyses. BARRACUDA incorporates a number of novel optimizations that are crucial for scaling concurrency bug detection to over a million threads.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "Princeton University", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Ariel Eizenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eizenberg:Ariel", "Yuanfeng Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Yuanfeng", "Toma Pigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pigli:Toma", "William Mansky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mansky:William", "Joseph Devietti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Devietti:Joseph"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2017", "pages": 15}
