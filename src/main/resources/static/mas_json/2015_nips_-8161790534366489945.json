{"title": "Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Multi-Frame Super-Resolution.", "fields": ["optical flow", "superresolution", "recurrent neural network", "computational complexity theory", "convolution"], "abstract": "Super resolving a low-resolution video is usually handled by either single-image super-resolution (SR) or multi-frame SR. Single-Image SR deals with each video frame independently, and ignores intrinsic temporal dependency of video frames which actually plays a very important role in video super-resolution. Multi-Frame SR generally extracts motion information, e.g., optical flow, to model the temporal dependency, which often shows high computational cost. Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can model long-term contextual information of temporal sequences well, we propose a bidirectional recurrent convolutional network for efficient multi-frame SR. Different from vanilla RNNs, 1) the commonly-used recurrent full connections are replaced with weight-sharing convolutional connections and 2) conditional convolutional connections from previous input layers to the current hidden layer are added for enhancing visual-temporal dependency modelling. With the powerful temporal dependency modelling, our model can super resolve videos with complex motions and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Due to the cheap convolution operations, our model has a low computational complexity and runs orders of magnitude faster than other multi-frame methods.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Center for Excellence in Education", "Center for Rese ... rn Recognition", "Center for Rese ... rn Recognition"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0008:Yan", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0025:Wei", "Liang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Liang"], "pages": 9}
