{"title": "Parsing occluded people by flexible compositions.", "fields": ["tree structure", "exploit", "graphical model", "tree", "parsing"], "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to parsing humans when there is significant occlusion. We model humans using a graphical model which has a tree structure building on recent work [32, 6] and exploit the connectivity prior that, even in presence of occlusion, the visible nodes form a connected subtree of the graphical model. We call each connected subtree a flexible composition of object parts. This involves a novel method for learning occlusion cues. During inference we need to search over a mixture of different flexible models. By exploiting part sharing, we show that this inference can be done extremely efficiently requiring only twice as many computations as searching for the entire object (i.e., not modeling occlusion). We evaluate our model on the standard benchmarked \u201cWe Are Family\u201d Stickmen dataset and obtain significant performance improvements over the best alternative algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xianjie Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xianjie", "Alan L.
