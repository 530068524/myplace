{"title": "Mobile Security Catching Up? Revealing the Nuts and Bolts of the Security of Mobile Devices.", "fields": ["cloud computing security", "mobile web", "mobile search", "network access control", "security through obscurity"], "abstract": "We are currently moving from the Internet society to a mobile society where more and more access to information is done by previously dumb phones. For example, the number of mobile phones using a full blown OS has risen to nearly200% from Q3/2009 to Q3/2010. As a result, mobile security is no longer immanent, but imperative. This survey paper provides a concise overview of mobile network security, attack vectors using the back end system and the web browser, but also the hardware layer and the user as attack enabler. We show differences and similarities between \"normal\" security and mobile security, and draw conclusions for further research opportunities in this area.", "citation": "Citations (246)", "departments": ["University of Mannheim", "University of Mannheim", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum"], "authors": ["Michael Becher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Becher:Michael", "Felix C.
