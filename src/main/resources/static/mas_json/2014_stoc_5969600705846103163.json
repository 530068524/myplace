We present input-sparsity-time and deterministic algorithms for constructing such a CUR matrix decomposition of  A  where  c  =  O ( k/e )  and r  =  O ( k/e )  and  rank( U ) =  k . Up to constant factors, our construction is simultaneously  optimal  in  c, r , and rank( U ).", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "IBM"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Christos Boutsidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boutsidis:Christos", "David P.
