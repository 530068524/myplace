The analysis of open government data is expected to encourage citizens to participate in government as well as to improve transparency and efficiency in government processes. Through interviews and survey responses we gathered information on forty projects that involved the analysis of open data. We found that collaborations were interdisciplinary, small in scale, with low turnover, and synchronous communication. Most of the projects asked exploratory questions and made use of descriptive statistics and visualizations. We discuss how these findings contribute to an understanding of the emerging practice of open data analysis and to a broader understanding of open collaboration.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Joohee Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Joohee", "Yla R.
