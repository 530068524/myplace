{"title": "Predator: A Practical Tool for Checking Manipulation of Dynamic Data Structures Using Separation Logic.", "fields": ["heap", "pointer", "predator", "separation logic", "linux kernel"], "abstract": "Predator is a new open source tool for verification of sequential C programs with dynamic linked data structures. The tool is based on separation logic with inductive predicates although it uses a graph description of heaps. Predator currently handles various forms of lists, including singly-linked as well as doubly-linked lists that may be circular, hierarchically nested and that may have various additional pointer links. Predator is implemented as a gcc plug-in and it is capable of handling lists in the form they appear in real system code, especially the Linux kernel, including a limited support of pointer arithmetic. Collaboration on further development of Predator is welcome.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Brno University of Technology", "Brno University of Technology", "Brno University of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Kamil Dudka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dudka:Kamil", "Petr Peringer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peringer:Petr", "Tom\u00e1s Vojnar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vojnar:Tom=aacute=s"], "pages": 7}
