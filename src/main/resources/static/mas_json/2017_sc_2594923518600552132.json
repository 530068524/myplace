We propose Maximal Frontier Betweenness Centrality (MFBC): a succinct BC algorithm based on novel sparse matrix multiplication routines that performs a factor of  p  1/3  less communication on  p  processors than the best known alternatives, for graphs with  n  vertices and average degree  k  =  n/p  2/3 . We formulate, implement, and prove the correctness of MFBC for weighted graphs by leveraging monoids instead of semirings, which enables a surprisingly succinct formulation. MFBC scales well for both extremely sparse and relatively dense graphs. It automatically searches a space of distributed data decompositions and sparse matrix multiplication algorithms for the most advantageous configuration. The MFBC implementation outperforms the well-known CombBLAS library by up to 8x and shows more robust performance. Our design methodology is readily extensible to other graph problems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "ETH Zurich", "Sapienza University of Rome", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Edgar Solomonik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solomonik:Edgar", "Maciej Besta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Besta:Maciej", "Flavio Vella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vella:Flavio", "Torsten Hoefler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoefler:Torsten"], "pages": 14}
