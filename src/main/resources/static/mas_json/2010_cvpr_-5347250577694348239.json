While many challenging online learning problems are inherently multi-class, online boosting and its variants are only able to solve binary tasks. In this paper, we present Online Multi-Class LPBoost (OMCLP) which is directly applicable to multi-class problems. From a theoretical point of view, our algorithm tries to maximize the multi-class soft-margin of the samples. In order to solve the LP problem in online settings, we perform an efficient variant of online convex programming, which is based on primal-dual gradient descent-ascent update strategies. We conduct an extensive set of experiments over machine learning benchmark datasets, as well as, on Caltech 101 category recognition dataset. We show that our method is able to outperform other online multi-class methods. We also apply our method to tracking where, we present an intuitive way to convert the binary tracking by detection problem to a multi-class problem where background patterns which are similar to the target class, become virtual classes. Applying our novel model, we outperform or achieve the state-of-the-art results on benchmark tracking videos.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Amir Saffari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saffari:Amir", "Martin Godec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Godec:Martin", "Thomas Pock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pock:Thomas", "Christian Leistner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leistner:Christian", "Horst Bischof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischof:Horst"], "pages": 8}
