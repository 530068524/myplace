In this paper, we present a low-dimensional analysis of anatomical shape variability in the space of diffeomorphisms and demonstrate its benefits for clinical studies. To combat the high dimensionality of the deformation descriptors, we develop a probabilistic model of principal geodesic analysis in a bandlimited low-dimensional space that still captures the underlying variability of image data. We demonstrate the performance of our model on a set of 3D brain MRI scans from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our model yields a more compact representation of group variation at substantially lower computational cost than models based on the high-dimensional state-of-the-art approaches such as tangent space PCA (TPCA) and probabilistic principal geodesic analysis (PPGA).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Concordia University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Dalian Maritime University"], "authors": ["Miaomiao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Miaomiao", "P.
