Our experience includes a number of promising results using HTM to improve performance in a variety of contexts, and also identifies some ways in which the feature could be improved to make it even better. We give detailed accounts of our experiences, sharing techniques we used to achieve the results we have, as well as describing challenges we faced in doing so.", "citation": "Citations (335)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Sun Microsystems Laboratories", "Sun Microsystems Laboratories", "Sun Microsystems Laboratories", "Sun Microsystems Laboratories"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["David Dice.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dice:David", "Yossi Lev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lev:Yossi", "Mark Moir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moir:Mark", "Daniel Nussbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nussbaum:Daniel"], "pages": 12}
