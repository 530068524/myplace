{"title": "Temporal Information Processing of a New Language: Fast Porting with Minimal Resources.", "fields": ["porting", "portuguese", "replicate", "constructed language", "timeml"], "abstract": "We describe the semi-automatic adaptation of a TimeML annotated corpus from English to Portuguese, a language for which TimeML annotated data was not available yet. In order to validate this adaptation, we use the obtained data to replicate some results in the literature that used the original English data. The fact that comparable results are obtained indicates that our approach can be used successfully to rapidly create semantically annotated resources for new languages.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Lisbon", "University of Lisbon"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Francisco Costa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costa:Francisco", "Ant\u00f3nio Branco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Branco:Ant=oacute=nio"], "pages": 7}
