While sensor position displacements such as rotations and translations have been recognised as a key limitation for the deployment of wearable systems, a realistic dataset is lacking. We introduce a concept of gradual sensor displacement conditions, including ideal, self-placement of a user, and mutual displacement deployments. These conditions were analysed in the dataset considering 33 fitness activities, recorded using 9 inertial sensor units from 17 participants. Our statistical analysis of acceleration features quantified relative effects of the displacement conditions. We expect that the dataset can be used to benchmark and compare recognition algorithms in the future.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["University of Granada", "University of Granada", "University of Granada", "University of Granada", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "authors": ["Oresti Ba\u00f1os.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ba=ntilde=os:Oresti", "Miguel Damas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damas:Miguel", "H\u00e9ctor Pomares.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pomares:H=eacute=ctor", "Ignacio Rojas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rojas:Ignacio", "M\u00e1t\u00e9 Attila T\u00f3th.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/T=oacute=th:M=aacute=t=eacute=_Attila", "Oliver Amft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amft:Oliver"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
