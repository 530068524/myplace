It builds on existing network routing and connection management protocols and one of its important features is the automatic rerouting of connections upon failure. Re-routing can be done with available restoration mechanisms including IGP-based rerouting and fast reroute with loop-free alternates. This is particularly attractive for use in Software Defined Networks (SDN) because the central controller need only be involved at connection set-up time and failures are handled automatically in a distributed manner. A significant challenge in restoration optimization in segment routed networks is the centralized determination of connections primary paths so as to enable the best sharing of restoration bandwidth over non-simultaneous network failures. We formulate this problem as a linear programming problem and develop an efficient primal-dual algorithm for the solution. We also develop a simple randomized rounding scheme for cases when there are additional constraints on segment routing. We demonstrate the significant capacity benefits achievable from this optimized restoration with segment routing.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Fang Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Fang", "Murali S.
