Given the NP-Completeness of the VNE problem, prior approaches primarily rely on solving/relaxing the link-based Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations, which lead to either extensive computational time, or non-optimal solutions. In this paper, for the first time, we present a path-based model for the VNE problem, namely P-VNE. By analyzing the dual formulation of the P-VNE model, we propose a column generation process, with which an optimal solution to the VNE problem can be found efficiently (when embedded into a branch-and-bound framework).", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Georgia State University", "Georgia State University", "Georgia State University"], "authors": ["Qian Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Qian", "Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0016:Yang", "Xiaojun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xiaojun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
