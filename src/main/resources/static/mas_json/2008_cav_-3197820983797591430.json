{"title": "THOR: A Tool for Reasoning about Shape and Arithmetic.", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "javascript", "shape analysis", "separation logic", "counter automaton"], "abstract": "We describe T hor ( T ool for  H eap- O riented  R easoning), a tool based on separation logic that is capable of reasoning automatically about heap-manipulating programs. There are several such systems in development now. However, T hor is unique in that it provides not only shape analysis, but also arithmetic reasoning via a novel combination procedure. Also, considerable effort has been put into making the output clear and easy to understand. T hor uses Javascript and HTML to produce an interactive representation of the analysis results.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "National Taiwan University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Stephen Magill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magill:Stephen", "Ming-Hsien Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Ming=Hsien", "Peter Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Peter", "Yih-Kuen Tsay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsay:Yih=Kuen"], "pages": 5}
