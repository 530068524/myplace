In particular, this gives a tight \\({2^{\\Omega(d(n^{1/d}-1))}}\\) lower bound on the size of depth d + 1 formulas computing the parity function. These results strengthen the corresponding \\({2^{\\Omega(n^{1/d})}}\\) and \\({O(\\log s)^d}\\) bounds for circuits due to Hastad (Proceedings of the 18th annual ACM symposium on theory of computing, ACM, New York, 1986) and Boppana (Inf Process Lett 63(5): 257\u2013261, 1997). Our proof technique studies a random process where the switching lemma is applied to formulas in an efficient manner.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Nat.
