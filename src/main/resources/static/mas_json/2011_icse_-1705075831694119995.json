In this paper we develop a quantitative software reliability assessment method in incremental development processes, based on the familiar non-homogeneous Poisson processes. More specifically, we utilize the software metrics observed in each incremental development and testing, and estimate the associated software reliability measures. In a numerical example with a real incremental developmental project data, it is shown that the estimate of software reliability with a specific model can take a realistic value, and that the reliability growth phenomenon can be observed even in the incremental development scheme.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Hiroshima University", "Hiroshima University", "Fujitsu"], "authors": ["Toshiya Fujii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujii:Toshiya", "Tadashi Dohi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dohi:Tadashi", "Takaji Fujiwara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujiwara:Takaji"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
