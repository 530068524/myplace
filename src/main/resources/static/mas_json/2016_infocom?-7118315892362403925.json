While this trend provides economics of scale, a key challenge is to ensure that the performance of virtual appliances match that of hardware boxes. We present the design and implementation of NFV-RT, a system that dynamically provisions resources in an NFV environment to provide timing guarantees. Specifically, given a set of service chains that each consist of some network functions, NFV-RT aims at maximizing the total number of requests that can be assigned to the cloud for each service chain, while ensuring that the assigned requests meet their deadlines. Our approach uses a linear programming model with randomized rounding to efficiently and proactively obtain a near-optimal solution. Our simulation shows that, given a cloud with thousands of machines and service chains, NFV-RT requires only a few seconds to compute the solution, while accepting three times the requests compared to baseline heuristics. In addition, under some special settings, NFV-RT can provide significant performance improvement. Our evaluation on a local testbed shows that 94% of the packets of the submitted requests meet their deadlines, which is three times that of previous reactive-based solutions.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0025:Yang", "Linh Thi Xuan Phan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phan:Linh_Thi_Xuan", "Boon Thau Loo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loo:Boon_Thau"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
