In this paper, we study the optimal error rate for aggregating labels provided by a set of non-expert workers. Under the classic Dawid-Skene model, we establish matching upper and lower bounds with an exact exponent mI(\u03c0) in which m is the number of workers and I(\u03c0) the average Chernoff information that characterizes the workers' collective ability. Such an exact characterization of the error exponent allows us to state a precise sample size requirement m > 1/I(\u03c0) log 1/e in order to achieve an e misclassification error. In addition, our results imply the optimality of various EM algorithms for crowd-sourcing initialized by consistent estimators.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Chao Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Chao", "Yu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yu", "Dengyong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Dengyong"], "pages": 9}
