For efficiency, the computation and communication of the server and client during an audit protocol should be significantly smaller than reading/transmitting the data in its entirety. Although the server is only asked to access a few locations of its storage during an audit, it must maintain full knowledge of all client data to be able to pass.", "citation": "Citations (149)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Ko\u00e7 University", "Northeastern University", "Rutgers University", "Ko\u00e7 University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["David Cash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cash:David", "Alptekin K\u00fcp\u00e7\u00fc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=uuml=p=ccedil==uuml=:Alptekin", "Daniel Wichs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wichs:Daniel"], "pages": 17}
