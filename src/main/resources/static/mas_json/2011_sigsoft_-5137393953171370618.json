{"title": "Cross-layer modeler: a tool for flexible multilevel modeling with consistency checking.", "fields": ["restrict", "model driven architecture", "multilevel model", "metamodeling", "workaround"], "abstract": "Model-driven engineering has become a popular methodology in software engineering. Most available modeling tools support the creation of models based on a fixed metamodel. Typically, tool users cannot change the metamodel to reflect domain changes or newly emerged requirements. As a consequence, an updated version of the tool with an evolved metamodel must be developed and models as well as constraints that ensure model consistency have to be co-evolved, often manually, to conform to the new metamodel. Both, tool evolution and the necessary co-evolutions, are time consuming and error prone tasks. Furthermore, common tools often restrict the number of metalevels that can be modeled and force modelers to use workarounds to express certain facts. To overcome these issues we present the Cross-Layer Modeler (XLM), a modeling tool that supports multilevel modeling and allows co-evolution of metamodels and models. The XLM automatically performs co-evolution of constraints and gives instant feedback about model consistency. We illustrate the novel modeling approach of our tool and discuss its main capabilities.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz"], "authors": ["Andreas Demuth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demuth:Andreas", "Roberto E.
