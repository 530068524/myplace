Dynamic channel allocation is believed to be an effective way to cope with the shortage of wireless channel resource. In this paper, we propose SPECIAL, which is a Strategy-Proof and EffiCIent multi-channel Auction mechanism for wireLess networks. SPECIAL guarantees the strategy-proofness of the channel auction, exploits wireless channels' spatial reusability, and achieves high channel allocation efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Xin Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Xin", "Hamidou Tembine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tembine:Hamidou"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
