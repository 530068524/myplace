{"title": "A spatially varying PSF-based prior for alpha matting.", "fields": ["prior probability", "deconvolution", "point spread function", "image formation", "convolution"], "abstract": "In this paper we considerably improve on a state-of-the-art alpha matting approach by incorporating a new prior which is based on the image formation process. In particular, we model the prior probability of an alpha matte as the convolution of a high-resolution binary segmentation with the spatially varying point spread function (PSF) of the camera. Our main contribution is a new and efficient de-convolution approach that recovers the prior model, given an approximate alpha matte. By assuming that the PSF is a kernel with a single peak, we are able to recover the binary segmentation with an MRF-based approach, which exploits flux and a new way of enforcing connectivity. The spatially varying PSF is obtained via a partitioning of the image into regions of similar defocus. Incorporating our new prior model into a state-of-the-art matting technique produces results that outperform all competitors, which we confirm using a publicly available benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Christoph Rhemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhemann:Christoph", "Carsten Rother.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rother:Carsten", "Pushmeet Kohli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohli:Pushmeet", "Margrit Gelautz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelautz:Margrit"], "pages": 8}
