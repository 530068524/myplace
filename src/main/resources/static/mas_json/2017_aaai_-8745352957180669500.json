{"title": "A Dependency-Based Neural Reordering Model for Statistical Machine Translation.", "fields": ["bleu", "dependency relation", "word order", "parse tree", "sentence"], "abstract": "In machine translation (MT) that involves translating between two languages with significant differences in word order, determining the correct word order of translated words is a major challenge. The dependency parse tree of a source sentence can help to determine the correct word order of the translated words. In this paper, we present a novel reordering approach utilizing a neural network and dependency-based embeddings to predict whether the translations of two source words linked by a dependency relation should remain in the same order or should be swapped in the translated sentence. Experiments on Chinese-to-English translation show that our approach yields a statistically significant improvement of 0.57 BLEU point on benchmark NIST test sets, compared to our prior state-of-the-art statistical MT system that uses sparse dependency-based reordering features.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Christian Hadiwinoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hadiwinoto:Christian", "Hwee Tou Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Hwee_Tou"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
