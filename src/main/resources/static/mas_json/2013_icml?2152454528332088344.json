{"title": "Mean Reversion with a Variance Threshold.", "fields": ["linear combination", "statistical arbitrage", "mean reversion", "variance risk premium", "semidefinite programming"], "abstract": "Starting from a sample path of a multivariate stochastic process, we study several techniques to isolate linear combinations of the variables with a maximal amount of mean reversion, while constraining the variance of the combination to be larger than a given threshold. We show that many of the optimization problems arising in this context can be solved exactly using semidefinite programming and a variant of the S-lemma. In finance, these methods can be used to isolate statistical arbitrage opportunities, i.e. mean reverting baskets with enough variance to overcome market friction. In a more general setting, mean reversion and its generalizations can also be used as a proxy for stationarity, while variance simply measures signal strength.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "authors": ["Marco Cuturi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cuturi:Marco", "Alexandre d'Aspremont.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/d=Aspremont:Alexandre"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
