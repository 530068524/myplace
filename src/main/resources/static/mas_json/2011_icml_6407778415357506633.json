However, many existing methods require restrictive data models for evidence about user preferences. We relax these restrictions by considering as data arbitrary pairwise comparisons\u2014the fundamental building blocks of ordinal rankings. We develop the first algorithms for learning Mallows models (and mixtures) with pairwise comparisons. At the heart is a new algorithm, the generalized repeated insertion model (GRIM), for sampling from arbitrary ranking distributions. We develop approximate samplers that are exact for many important special cases\u2014and have provable bounds with pair-wise evidence\u2014and derive algorithms for evaluating log-likelihood, learning Mallows mixtures, and non-parametric estimation. Experiments on large, real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (152)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Tyler Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Tyler", "Craig Boutilier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boutilier:Craig"], "pages": 8}
