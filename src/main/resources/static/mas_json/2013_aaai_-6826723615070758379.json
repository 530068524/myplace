{"title": "Ties Matter: Complexity of Manipulation when Tie-Breaking with a Random Vote.", "fields": ["nondeterministic algorithm", "voting", "cardinal voting systems", "ask price", "social choice theory"], "abstract": "We study the impact on strategic voting of tie-breaking by means of considering the order of tied candidates within a random vote. We compare this to another nondeterministic tie-breaking rule where we simply choose candidate uniformly at random. In general, we demonstrate that there is no connection between the computational complexity of computing a manipulating vote with the two different types of tie-breaking. However, we prove that for some scoring rules, the computational complexity of computing a manipulation can increase from polynomial to NP-hard. We also discuss the relationship with the computational complexity of computing a manipulating vote when we ask for a candidate to be the unique winner, or to be among the set of co-winners.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["NICTA", "NICTA", "NICTA", "NICTA", "NICTA"], "authors": ["Haris Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz_0001:Haris", "Serge Gaspers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaspers:Serge", "Nicholas Mattei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mattei:Nicholas", "Nina Narodytska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narodytska:Nina", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
