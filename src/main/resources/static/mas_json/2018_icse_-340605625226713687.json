In this paper, we introduce C hime , a launch-mode-aware context-sensitive activity transition analysis that models different instances of an activity class according to its launch mode and the transitions between activities context-sensitively, by working together with an object-sensitive pointer analysis.   Our evaluation shows that our context-sensitive activity transition analysis is more precise than its context-insensitive counterpart in capturing activity transitions, facilitating GUI testing, and improving the pointer analysis precision.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Yifei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yifei", "Yulei Sui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sui:Yulei", "Jingling Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Jingling"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
