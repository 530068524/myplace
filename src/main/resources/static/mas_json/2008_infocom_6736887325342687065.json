Applications of wireless body sensor networks include healthcare, entertainment, and personal assistance, in which sensors collect physiological and activity data from people and their environments. In these body sensor networks, quality of service is needed to provide reliable data communication over prioritized data streams. This paper proposes BodyQoS, the first running QoS system demonstrated on an emulated body sensor network. BodyQoS adopts an asymmetric architecture, in which most processing is done on a resource rich aggregator, minimizing the load on resource limited sensor nodes. A virtual MAC is developed in BodyQoS to make it radio-agnostic, allowing a BodyQoS to schedule wireless resources without knowing the implementation details of the underlying MAC protocols. Another unique property of BodyQoS is its ability to provide adaptive resource scheduling. When the effective bandwidth of the channel degrades due to RF interference or body fading effect, BodyQoS adaptively schedules remaining bandwidth to meet QoS requirements. We have implemented BodyQoS in NesC on top of TinyOS, and evaluated its performance on MicaZ devices. Our system performance study shows that BodyQoS delivers significantly improved performance over conventional solutions in combating channel impairment.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Gang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Gang", "Jian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jian", "Chieh-Yih Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Chieh=Yih", "Mark D.
