{"title": "Generating Synthetic Comparable Questions for News Articles.", "fields": ["ranking", "data mining", "computer science", "template", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "We introduce the novel task of automatically generating questions that are relevant to a text but do not appear in it. One motivating example of its application is for increasing user engagement around news articles by suggesting relevant comparable questions, such as \u201cis Beyonce a better singer than Madonna?\u201d, for the user to answer. We present the first algorithm for the task, which consists of: (a) offline construction of a comparable question template database; (b) ranking of relevant templates to a given article; and (c) instantiation of templates only with entities in the article whose comparison under the template\u2019s relation makes sense. We tested the suggestions generated by our algorithm via a Mechanical Turk experiment, which showed a significant improvement over the strongest baseline of more than 45% in all metrics.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Oleg Rokhlenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rokhlenko:Oleg", "Idan Szpektor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szpektor:Idan"], "pages": 10}
