We prove convergence results with respect to variants of norms, under a capacity assumption on the hypothesis space and a regularity condition on the target function. As a result, we obtain optimal rates for regularized algorithms with randomized sketches, provided that the sketch dimension is proportional to the effective dimension up to a logarithmic factor. As a byproduct, we obtain similar results for Nystr\\\"{o}m regularized algorithms. Our results are the first ones with optimal, distribution-dependent rates that do not have any saturation effect for sketched/Nystr\\\"{o}m regularized algorithms, considering both the attainable and non-attainable cases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Junhong Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Junhong", "Volkan Cevher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cevher:Volkan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
