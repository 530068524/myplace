Most exiting automatic movie summarization approaches heavily rely on video content only, which may not deliver ideal result due to the semantic gap between computer calculated low-level features and human used high-level understanding. In this paper, we incorporate script into movie analysis and propose a novel character-based movie summarization approach, which is validated by modern film theory that what actually catches audiences' attention is the character. We first segment scenes in the movie by analysis and alignment of script and movie. Then we conduct substory discovery and content attention analysis based on the scent analysis and character interaction features. Given obtained movie structure and content attention value, we calculate movie attraction scores at both shot and scene levels and adopt this as criterion to generate movie summary. The promising experimental results demonstrate that character analysis is effective for movie summarization and movie content understanding.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Jitao Sang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sang:Jitao", "Changsheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Changsheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
