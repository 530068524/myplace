The method takes as input the communication matrix of an arbitrary problem as an array with entries C(i, j), which represents the data communicated from domain i to domain j. Given C(i, j), we implement a heuristic map that attempts to sequentially map a domain and its communication neighbors either to the same BG/L node or to near-neighbor nodes on the BG/L torus, while keeping the number of domains mapped to a BG/L node constant. We then generate a Markov chain of maps using Monte Carlo simulation with free energy F =\u03a3i,j C(i, j)H(i, j), where H(i, j) is the smallest number of hops on the BG/L torus between domain i and domain j. For two large parallel applications, SAGE and UMT2000, the method was tested against the default Message Passing Interface rank order layout on up to 2,048 BG/L nodes. It produced maps that improved communication efficiency by up to 45%.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Trinity College", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Beijing Jiaotong University", "Beijing Jiaotong University", "Beijing Jiaotong University", "Cornell University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Delft University of Technology", "Pusan National University", "Dongyang University", "Shenzhen Bao'an ... ational Airport"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Flavio Chierichetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chierichetti:Flavio", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi", "Prabhakar Raghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavan:Prabhakar"], "pages": 10}
