{"title": "Limits of Preprocessing.", "fields": ["constraint satisfaction", "kernel", "constraint satisfaction problem", "polynomial", "bayesian inference"], "abstract": "We present a first theoretical analysis of the power of polynomial-time preprocessing for important combinatorial problems from various areas in AI. We consider problems from Constraint Satisfaction, Global Constraints, Satisfiability, Nonmonotonic and Bayesian Reasoning. We show that, subject to a complexity theoretic assumption, none of the considered problems can be reduced by polynomial-time preprocessing to a problem kernel whose size is polynomial in a structural problem parameter of the input, such as induced width or backdoor size. Our results provide a firm theoretical boundary for the performance of polynomial-time preprocessing algorithms for the considered problems.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Stefan Szeider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szeider:Stefan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
