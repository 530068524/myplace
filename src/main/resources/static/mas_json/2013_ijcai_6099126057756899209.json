In this paper we propose three different models to capture lexical cohesion for document-level machine translation: (a) a direct reward model where translation hypotheses are rewarded whenever lexical cohesion devices occur in them, (b) a conditional probability model where the appropriateness of using lexical cohesion devices is measured, and (c) a mutual information trigger model where a lexical cohesion relation is considered as a trigger pair and the strength of the association between the trigger and the triggered item is estimated by mutual information. We integrate the three models into hierarchical phrase-based machine translation and evaluate their effectiveness on the NIST Chinese-English translation tasks with large-scale training data. Experiment results show that all three models can achieve substantial improvements over the baseline and that the mutual information trigger model performs better than the others.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Dublin City University", "Key Laboratory  ... hnology, China", "Key Laboratory  ... hnology, China"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Deyi Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Deyi", "Guosheng Ben.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben:Guosheng", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Min", "Yajuan Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Yajuan", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun"], "pages": 7}
