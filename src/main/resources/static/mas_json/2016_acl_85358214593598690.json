{"title": "Language to Logical Form with Neural Attention.", "fields": ["encoding", "natural language", "logical form", "template", "parsing"], "abstract": "Semantic parsing aims at mapping natural language to machine interpretable meaning representations. Traditional approaches rely on high-quality lexicons, manually-built templates, and linguistic features which are either domainor representation-specific. In this paper we present a general method based on an attention-enhanced encoder-decoder model. We encode input utterances into vector representations, and generate their logical forms by conditioning the output sequences or trees on the encoding vectors. Experimental results on four datasets show that our approach performs competitively without using hand-engineered features and is easy to adapt across domains and meaning representations.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Institute of La ... and Computation"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Li Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0004:Li", "Mirella Lapata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lapata:Mirella"], "pages": -1}
