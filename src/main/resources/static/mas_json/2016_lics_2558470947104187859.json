However, acyclic CQs and CQs of bounded tree-width can be evaluated in polynomial time in combined complexity and they are fixed-parameter tractable.   We study the problem of whether a CQ can be rewritten into an equivalent CQ of bounded tree-width, in the presence of unary functional dependencies, assuming bounded arity signatures. We show that this problem is decidable in doubly exponential time, or in exponential time for a subclass of CQ's. When it exists, the algorithm also yields a witness query.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["L'Abri"], "authors": ["Diego Figueira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Figueira:Diego"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
