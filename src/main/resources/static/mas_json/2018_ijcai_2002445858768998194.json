{"title": "NPE: Neural Personalized Embedding for Collaborative Filtering.", "fields": ["recommender system", "matrix decomposition", "embedding", "collaborative filtering", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Matrix factorization is one of the most efficient approaches in recommender systems. However, such algorithms, which rely on the interactions between users and items, perform poorly for \"cold-users\" (users with little history of such interactions) and at capturing the relationships between closely related items. To address these problems, we propose a neural personalized embedding (NPE) model, which improves the recommendation performance for cold-users and can learn effective representations of items. It models a user's click to an item in two terms: the personal preference of the user for the item, and the relationships between this item and other items clicked by the user. We show that NPE outperforms competing methods for top-N recommendations, specially for cold-user recommendations. We also performed a qualitative analysis that shows the effectiveness of the representations learned by the model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Graduate University for Advanced Studies", "National Institute of Informatics", "Graduate University for Advanced Studies"], "authors": ["ThaiBinh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:ThaiBinh", "Atsuhiro Takasu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takasu:Atsuhiro"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
