This paper proposes a novel algorithm to identify modular functions corresponding to such features and to provide usable interfaces for the extracted functions. We provide a way to represent a desired feature with two executions that both execute the feature but with different inputs. Instead of reverse engineering the interface of a function, we wrap the existing interface and provide a simpler and more intuitive interface for the function through concretization and redirection. Experiments show that our technique can be applied to extract varied features from several real world applications including a malicious application.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Simon Fraser University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Applied Communi ... s Sciences, USA"], "authors": ["Dohyeong Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Dohyeong", "William N.
