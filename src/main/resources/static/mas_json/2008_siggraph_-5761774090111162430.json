{"title": "Two-dimensional communication.", "fields": ["haptic technology", "electricity", "wireless", "bandwidth", "electrical contacts"], "abstract": "We have proposed an innovative communication device, the Two\u2013 Dimensional Communication sheet (2DC sheet). The nodes touching to the 2DC sheet can communicate with each other with 54 Mbps of bandwidth and can acquire 10 W of electricity. The 2DC sheet requires no direct electrical contact between the nodes and the sheet. Therefore nodes can be moved freely on the sheet. Wireless and batteryless ubiquitous infrastructure is possible through these features of the Two\u2013Dimensional Communication sheet.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Cellcross Co.
