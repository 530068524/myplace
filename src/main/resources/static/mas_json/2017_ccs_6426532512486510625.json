{"title": "FreeGuard: A Faster Secure Heap Allocator.", "fields": ["spite", "memory safety", "heap overflow", "allocator", "software security assurance"], "abstract": "In spite of years of improvements to software security, heap-related attacks still remain a severe threat. One reason is that many existing memory allocators fall short in a variety of aspects. For instance, performance-oriented allocators are designed with very limited countermeasures against attacks, but secure allocators generally suffer from significant performance overhead, e.g., running up to 10x slower. This paper, therefore, introduces FreeGuard, a secure memory allocator that prevents or reduces a wide range of heap-related security attacks, such as heap overflows, heap over-reads, use-after-frees, as well as double and invalid frees. FreeGuard has similar performance to the default Linux allocator, with less than 2% overhead on average, but provides significant improvement to security guarantees.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Texas at San Antonio", "University of Texas at San Antonio", "United States Military Academy", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at San Antonio"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Sam Silvestro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silvestro:Sam", "Hongyu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hongyu", "Corey Crosser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crosser:Corey", "Zhiqiang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhiqiang", "Tongping Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tongping"], "pages": 15}
