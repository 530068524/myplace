{"title": "IPSViz: An After-Action Review Tool for Human-Virtual Human Experiences.", "fields": ["interactive visualization", "information visualization", "virtual machine", "social visualization", "interpersonal communication"], "abstract": "This paper proposes after-action review (AAR) with human-virtual human (H-VH) experiences. H-VH experiences are seeing increased use in training for real-world, H-H experiences. To improve training, the users of H-VH experiences need to review, evaluate, and get feedback on them. AAR enables users to review their H- VH interaction, evaluate their actions, and receive feedback on how to improve future real-world, H-H experiences. The Interpersonal Scenario Visualizer (IPSViz), an AAR tool for H-VH experiences, is presented. IPSViz allows medical students to review their interactions with VH patients. To enable review, IPSViz generates spatial, temporal, and social visualizations of H- VH interactions. Visualizations are generated by treating the interaction as a set of signals. Interaction signals are captured, logged, and processed to generate visualizations for review, evaluation and feedback. In a study (N=27), reviewing the visualizations helped students become self-aware of their actions with a virtual human and gain insight into how to improve interactions with real humans.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Andrew Raij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raij:Andrew", "Benjamin Lok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lok:Benjamin"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
