{"title": "SHiP: signature-based hit predictor for high performance caching.", "fields": ["adaptive replacement cache", "snoopy cache", "bus sniffing", "smart cache", "cache pollution"], "abstract": "The shared last-level caches in CMPs play an important role in improving application performance and reducing off-chip memory bandwidth requirements. In order to use LLCs more efficiently, recent research has shown that changing the re-reference prediction on cache insertions and cache hits can significantly improve cache performance. A fundamental challenge, however, is how to best predict the re-reference pattern of an incoming cache line.   This paper shows that cache performance can be improved by correlating the re-reference behavior of a cache line with a unique signature. We investigate the use of memory region, program counter, and instruction sequence history based signatures. We also propose a novel Signature-based Hit Predictor (SHiP) to learn the re-reference behavior of cache lines belonging to each signature. Overall, we find that SHiP offers substantial improvements over the baseline LRU replacement and state-of-the-art replacement policy proposals. On average, SHiP improves sequential and multiprogrammed application performance by roughly 10% and 12% over LRU replacement, respectively. Compared to recent replacement policy proposals such as Seg-LRU and SDBP, SHiP nearly doubles the performance gains while requiring less hardware overhead.", "citation": "Citations (169)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Intel", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "Intel"], "authors": ["Carole-Jean Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Carole=Jean", "Aamer Jaleel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaleel:Aamer", "William Hasenplaugh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasenplaugh:William", "Margaret Martonosi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martonosi:Margaret", "Simon C.
