In this paper, we present a new model for analyzing the performance of bulk-synchronous HPC applications based on the use of  extreme value theory.  After validating this model against both synthetic and real applications, the paper then uses both simulation and modeling techniques to profile next-generation interference sources and characterize their behavior and performance impact on a selection of HPC benchmarks, mini-applications, and applications. Lastly, this work shows how the model can be used to understand  how  current interference mitigation techniques in multi-processors work.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of New Mexico", "University of New Mexico", "University of New Mexico", "Sandia National Laboratories", "Sandia National Laboratories"], "authors": ["Oscar H.
