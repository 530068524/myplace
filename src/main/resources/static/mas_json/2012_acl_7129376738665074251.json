{"title": "Cross-Lingual Mixture Model for Sentiment Classification.", "fields": ["data set", "sentiment analysis", "generative grammar", "labeled data", "machine translation"], "abstract": "The amount of labeled sentiment data in English is much larger than that in other languages. Such a disproportion arouse interest in cross-lingual sentiment classification, which aims to conduct sentiment classification in the target language (e.g. Chinese) using labeled data in the source language (e.g. English). Most existing work relies on machine translation engines to directly adapt labeled data from the source language to the target language. This approach suffers from the limited coverage of vocabulary in the machine translation results. In this paper, we propose a generative cross-lingual mixture model (CLMM) to leverage unlabeled bilingual parallel data. By fitting parameters to maximize the likelihood of the bilingual parallel data, the proposed model learns previously unseen sentiment words from the large bilingual parallel data and improves vocabulary coverage significantly. Experiments on multiple data sets show that CLMM is consistently effective in two settings: (1) labeled data in the target language are unavailable; and (2) labeled data in the target language are also available.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Peking University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Peking University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xinfan Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Xinfan", "Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu", "Xiaohua Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaohua", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming", "Ge Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ge", "Houfeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Houfeng"], "pages": 10}
