Here, we adopt cognitive psychology principles to design a flexible representation that can adapt to changes in object appearance during tracking. Inspired by the well-known Atkinson-Shiffrin Memory Model, we propose MUlti-Store Tracker (MUSTer), a dual-component approach consisting of short- and long-term memory stores to process target appearance memories. A powerful and efficient Integrated Correlation Filter (ICF) is employed in the short-term store for short-term tracking. The integrated long-term component, which is based on keypoint matching-tracking and RANSAC estimation, can interact with the long-term memory and provide additional information for output control. MUSTer was extensively evaluated on the CVPR2013 Online Object Tracking Benchmark (OOTB) and ALOV++ datasets. The experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of MUSTer in comparison with other state-of-art trackers.", "citation": "Citations (282)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Paris", "Toyota", "Toyota"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhibin Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Zhibin", "Zhe Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhe", "Chaohui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chaohui", "Xue Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Xue", "Danil V.
