{"title": "Finding Needles in an Encyclopedic Haystack: Detecting Classes Among Wikipedia Articles.", "fields": ["haystack", "data mining", "knowledge acquisition", "precision and recall", "preprocessor"], "abstract": "A lightweight method distinguishes articles within Wikipedia that are classes (\u201cNovel\u201d, \u201cBook\u201d) from other articles (\u201cThree Men in a Boat\u201d, \u201cDiary of a Pilgrimage\u201d). It exploits clues available within the article text and within categories associated with articles in Wikipedia, while not requiring any linguistic preprocessing tools. Experimental results show that classes can be identified among Wikipedia articles in multiple languages, at aggregate precision and recall above 0.9 and 0.6 respectively.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Google"], "authors": ["Marius Pasca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasca:Marius"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
