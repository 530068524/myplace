The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work.", "citation": "Citations (490)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Girish Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni:Girish", "Visruth Premraj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Premraj:Visruth", "Sagnik Dhar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhar:Sagnik", "Siming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Siming", "Yejin Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Yejin", "Alexander C.
