{"title": "Leveraging stored energy for handling power emergencies in aggressively provisioned datacenters.", "fields": ["watt", "data center", "headroom", "peaking power plant", "provisioning"], "abstract": "Datacenters spend $10-25 per watt in provisioning their power infrastructure, regardless of the watts actually consumed. Since peak power needs arise rarely, provisioning power infrastructure for them can be expensive. One can, thus, aggressively under-provision infrastructure assuming that simultaneous peak draw across all equipment will happen rarely. The resulting non-zero probability of emergency events where power needs exceed provisioned capacity, however small, mandates graceful reaction mechanisms to cap the power draw instead of leaving it to disruptive circuit breakers/fuses. Existing strategies for power capping use temporal knobs local to a server that throttle the rate of execution (using power modes), and/or spatial knobs that redirect/migrate excess load to regions of the datacenter with more power headroom. We show these mechanisms to have performance degrading ramifications, and propose an entirely orthogonal solution that leverages existing UPS batteries to temporarily augment the utility supply during emergencies. We build an experimental prototype to demonstrate such power capping on a cluster of 8 servers, each with an individual battery, and implement several online heuristics in the context of different datacenter workloads to evaluate their effectiveness in handling power emergencies. We show that: (i) our battery-based solution can handle emergencies of short duration on its own, (ii) supplement existing reaction mechanisms to enhance their efficacy for longer emergencies, and (iii) battery even provide feasible options when other knobs do not suffice.", "citation": "Citations (117)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Sriram Govindan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Govindan:Sriram", "Di Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Di", "Anand Sivasubramaniam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sivasubramaniam:Anand", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urgaonkar:Bhuvan"], "pages": 12}
