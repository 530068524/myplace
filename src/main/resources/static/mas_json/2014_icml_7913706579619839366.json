{"title": "Taming the Monster: A Fast and Simple Algorithm for Contextual Bandits.", "fields": ["oracle", "simple algorithm", "machine learning", "monster", "regret"], "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for the contextual bandit learning problem, where the learner repeatedly takes one of K actions in response to the observed context, and observes the reward only for that action. Our method assumes access to an oracle for solving fully supervised cost-sensitive classification problems and achieves the statistically optimal regret guarantee with only O(\u221aKT) oracle calls across all T rounds. By doing so, we obtain the most practical contextual bandit learning algorithm amongst approaches that work for general policy classes. We conduct a proof-of-concept experiment which demonstrates the excellent computational and statistical performance of (an online variant of) our algorithm relative to several strong baselines.", "citation": "Citations (150)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Columbia University", "Yahoo!", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Alekh Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Alekh", "Daniel J.
