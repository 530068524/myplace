Prior work focus on optimization methods for finding high-quality restoration plans. Optimal solutions consist in a sequence of grid repairs and corresponding steady states. However, such approaches lack formal guarantees on the transient stability of restoration actions, a key property to avoid additional grid damage and cascading failures. In this paper, we show how to integrate transient stability in the optimization procedure by capturing the rotor dynamics of power generators. Our approach reasons about the differential equations describing the dynamics and their underlying transient states. The key contribution lies in modeling and solving optimization problems that return stable generators dispatch minimizing the difference with respect to steady states solutions. Computational efficiency is increased using preprocessing procedures along with traditional reduction techniques. Experimental results on existing benchmarks confirm the feasibility of the new approach.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Hassan L.
