As the rank width of a graph is bounded in terms of its clique width, we also obtain a polynomial time isomorphism test for graph classes of bounded clique width.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Martin Grohe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grohe:Martin", "Pascal Schweitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schweitzer:Pascal"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
