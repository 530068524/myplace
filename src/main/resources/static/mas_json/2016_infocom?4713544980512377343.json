{"title": "RAM: Radar-based activity monitor.", "fields": ["exploit", "participatory sensing", "activity recognition", "occupancy", "man portable radar"], "abstract": "Activity recognition has applications in a variety of human-in-the-loop settings such as smart home health monitoring, green building energy and occupancy management, intelligent transportation, and participatory sensing. While fine-grained activity recognition systems and approaches help enable a multitude of novel applications, discovering them with non-intrusive ambient sensor systems pose challenging design, as well as data processing, mining, and activity recognition issues. In this paper, we develop a low-cost heterogeneous Radar based Activity Monitoring (RAM) system for recognizing fine-grained activities. We exploit the feasibility of using an array of heterogeneous micro-doppler radars to recognize low-level activities. We prototype a short-range and a long-range radar system and evaluate the feasibility of using the system for fine-grained activity recognition. In our evaluation, using real data traces, we show that our system can detect fine-grained user activities with 92.84% accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County"], "authors": ["Md Abdullah Al Hafiz Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Md_Abdullah_Al_Hafiz", "Ruthvik Kukkapalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kukkapalli:Ruthvik", "Piyush Waradpande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waradpande:Piyush", "Sekar Kulandaivel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulandaivel:Sekar", "Nilanjan Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Nilanjan", "Nirmalya Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Nirmalya", "Ryan Robucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robucci:Ryan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
