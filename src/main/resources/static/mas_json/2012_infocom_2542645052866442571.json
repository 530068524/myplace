The Markov Chain is constructed by partitioning the entire range of shadowing into a finite number of intervals. We determine the MC transition matrix in two ways: (i) via a parsimonious modeling approach in which shadowing effects are modeled as a log-normally distributed random variable affecting the received power, and the transition probabilities are derived as functions of the variance and autocorrelation function of shadowing; (ii) via an empirical approach, in which the MC transition matrix is calculated by directly measuring the changes in signal strengths collected in a 802.16e (WiMAX) network. We present a validation of the abstract model by comparing its steady state and transient performance predictions with those computed using the empirically derived transition matrix.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Rutgers University", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Anand Seetharam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seetharam:Anand", "Jim Kurose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurose:Jim", "Dennis Goeckel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goeckel:Dennis", "Gautam D.
