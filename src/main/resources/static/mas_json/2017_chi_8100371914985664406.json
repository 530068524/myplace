These workers face the pervasive and detrimental challenge of wage violations, also known as wage theft, which is any illegal activity by an employer that denies benefits or wages to employees. We interviewed 24 low-wage workers who experienced wage theft and sought justice about their work practices, challenges, and information technology usage. Based on these interviews, we identify three key sociotechnical practices these workers engaged in to address their wage theft: 1)  identifying wage and payment discrepancies ; 2)  tracking and documenting work ; and 3)  pursuing wage claims . Seeking to leverage HCI research to interrupt uneven social, economic, and information relations in the low-wage workplace, we ultimately reflect on the possibility and limits of several key design recommendations.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Lynn Dombrowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dombrowski:Lynn", "Adriana Alvarado Garcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia:Adriana_Alvarado", "Jessica Despard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Despard:Jessica"], "pages": 14}
