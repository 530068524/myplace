We model the generation problem as a Markov decision process with a suitably defined reward function that reflects the communicative goal. We then use probabilistic planning to solve the MDP and generate a sentence that, with high probability, accomplishes the communicative goal. We show empirically that our approach can generate complex sentences with a speed that generally matches or surpasses the state of the art. Further, we show that our approach is anytime and can handle complex communicative goals, including negated goals.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Case Western Reserve University", "Electrical Engi ... omputer Science"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nathan McKinley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McKinley:Nathan", "Soumya Ray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ray:Soumya"], "pages": 10}
