{"title": "Digging in the crates: an ethnographic study of DJS' work.", "fields": ["competitive advantage", "crate", "ethnography", "digging", "metadata"], "abstract": "An ethnographic study uncovers the work of nightclub DJs, which extends far beyond the act of mixing tracks to also encompass collecting music, preparing for performances, and promotion and networking. We reveal how DJs value vinyl and digital formats in different ways, acquire music through 'crate digging', prepare physical and digital crates of music before gigs, and how these underpin improvised selections during their performances. We document how DJs interact with promoters, venues, dancers and other DJs, revealing an etiquette that governs how they select and share music, and manage an ongoing tension between revealing and hiding metadata so as to maintain a competitive edge. We raise implications for technologies to support DJs, while also shedding light on previous studies of music consumption and sharing in other settings.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Ahmed Y.
