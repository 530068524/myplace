With the increasing demand for moving file systems to the cloud, current methods of providing such enterprise-grade resiliency are very inefficient. For example, replication based methods incur large storage cost though they provide low access latencies. While erasure coded schemes reduce storage cost, they are associated with large access latencies and high bandwidth cost. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme named CAROM, an ensemble of replication and erasure codes, to provide resiliency in cloud file systems with high efficiency. While maintaining the same consistency semantics seen in today's cloud file systems, CAROM provides the benefit of low bandwidth cost, low storage cost, and low access latencies. We perform a large-scale evaluation using real-world file system traces and demonstrate that CAROM outperforms replication based schemes in storage cost by up to 60% and erasure coded schemes in bandwidth cost by up to 43%, while maintaining low access latencies close to those in replication based schemes.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Yadi Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Yadi", "Thyaga Nandagopal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nandagopal:Thyaga", "Krishna P.
