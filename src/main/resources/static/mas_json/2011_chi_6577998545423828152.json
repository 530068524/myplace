Establishing an empirical ground supporting decisions regarding user involvement can provide valuable guidelines for the design of such systems. We describe two studies examining the effects of choice, disclosure, and multiple strategy usage on user compliance to persuasive attempts. We show that involving users in the selection of a specific influence strategy can increase compliance, while disclosing the persuasive intent can reduce compliance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is not only feasible, but optimal to choose the single correct influence strategy for a given context; even more so than implementing multiple relevant and congruent influence attempts.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Philips", "Accenture", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Maurits Kaptein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaptein:Maurits", "Steven Duplinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duplinsky:Steven", "Panos Markopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markopoulos:Panos"], "pages": 10}
