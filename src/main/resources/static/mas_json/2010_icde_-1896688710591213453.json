Several methods have been proposed to solve OM problems, but none of them seems to be at the same time fully automated and very effective. In this paper we present a fundamentally new suite of methods that instead possesses both these abilities.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Istituto Nazion ... 16, Roma, Italy", "Istituto Nazion ... 16, Roma, Italy", "Sapienza Univer ... iosto 25, Italy"], "authors": ["Diego Zardetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zardetto:Diego", "Monica Scannapieco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scannapieco:Monica", "Tiziana Catarci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catarci:Tiziana"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
