In particular, convergence to network-wide agreement is proven for both evolutionary networks with fixed interaction dynamics, as well as for coevolutionary networks where these dynamics change over time. Moreover, an extension to the CAIPD model is proposed that allows to model influence on the evolution of cooperation in social networks. As such, this work contributes to a better understanding of behavioral change on social networks, and provides a first step towards their active control.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Maastricht University", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Liverpool", "University of Liverpool", "Maastricht University"], "authors": ["Bijan Ranjbar Sahraei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahraei:Bijan_Ranjbar", "Haitham Bou-Ammar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bou=Ammar:Haitham", "Daan Bloembergen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bloembergen:Daan", "Karl Tuyls.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuyls:Karl", "Gerhard Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:Gerhard"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
