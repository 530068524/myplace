{"title": "Does One-Against-All or One-Against-One Improve the Performance of Multiclass Classifications?", "fields": ["naive bayes classifier", "classification rule", "multiclass classification", "statistical classification", "binary number"], "abstract": "One-against-all and one-against-one are two popular methodologies for reducing multiclass classification problems into a set of binary classifications. In this paper, we are interested in the performance of both one-against-all and one-against-one for classification algorithms, such as decision tree, naive bayes, support vector machine, and logistic regression. Since both one-against-all and one-against-one work like creating a classification committee, they are expected to improve the performance of classification algorithms. However, our experimental results surprisingly show that one-against-all worsens the performance of the algorithms on most datasets. One-against-one helps, but performs worse than the same iterations of bagging these algorithms. Thus, we conclude that both one-against-all and one-against-one should not be used for the algorithms that can perform multiclass classifications directly. Bagging is better approach for improving their performance.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Central Arkansas", "University of Central Arkansas"], "authors": ["Robert Kyle Eichelberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eichelberger:Robert_Kyle", "Victor S.
