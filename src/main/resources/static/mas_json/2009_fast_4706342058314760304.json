{"title": "Cumulus: Filesystem Backup to the Cloud.", "fields": ["backup", "cloud computing", "storage efficiency", "cloud storage", "backup software"], "abstract": "Cumulus is a system for efficiently implementing filesystem backups over the Internet, specifically designed under a  thin cloud  assumption\u2014that the remote datacenter storing the backups does not provide any special backup services, but only a least-common-denominator storage interface. Cumulus aggregates data from small files for storage and uses LFS-inspired segment cleaning to maintain storage efficiency. While Cumulus can use virtually any storage service, we show its efficiency is comparable to integrated approaches.", "citation": "Citations (254)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Michael Vrable.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vrable:Michael", "Stefan Savage.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savage:Stefan", "Geoffrey M.
