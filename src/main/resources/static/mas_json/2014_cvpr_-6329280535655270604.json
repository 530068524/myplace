{"title": "Latent Regression Forest: Structured Estimation of 3D Articulated Hand Posture.", "fields": ["probabilistic latent semantic analysis", "pose", "discriminative model", "point cloud", "decision tree model"], "abstract": "In this paper we present the Latent Regression Forest (LRF), a novel framework for real-time, 3D hand pose estimation from a single depth image. In contrast to prior forest-based methods, which take dense pixels as input, classify them independently and then estimate joint positions afterwards, our method can be considered as a structured coarse-to-fine search, starting from the centre of mass of a point cloud until locating all the skeletal joints. The searching process is guided by a learnt Latent Tree Model which reflects the hierarchical topology of the hand. Our main contributions can be summarised as follows: (i) Learning the topology of the hand in an unsupervised, data-driven manner. (ii) A new forest-based, discriminative framework for structured search in images, as well as an error regression step to avoid error accumulation. (iii) A new multi-view hand pose dataset containing 180K annotated images from 10 different subjects. Our experiments show that the LRF out-performs state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (182)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Danhang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Danhang", "Hyung Jin Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Hyung_Jin", "Alykhan Tejani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tejani:Alykhan", "Tae-Kyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Tae=Kyun"], "pages": 8}
