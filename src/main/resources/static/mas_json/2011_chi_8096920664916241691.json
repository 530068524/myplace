However, the human capability to control pen tilt has not been fully evaluated. This paper systematically investigates the human ability to perform discrete target selection tasks by varying the stylus' tilt angle through two controlled experiments: pen tilt target acquiring (Experiment 1) and tilt pointing (Experiment 2). Results revealed a decreasing power relationship between angular width and selection time in Experiment 1. The results of Experiment 2 confirmed that pen tilt pointing can be modeled by Fitts' law. Based on our quantitative analysis, we discuss the human ability to control pen tilt and the implications of pen tilt use. We also propose a taxonomy of pen tilt based interaction techniques and showcase a series of possible pen tilt technique designs.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Kochi University of Technology", "University of Toronto", "Kochi University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yizhong Xin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xin:Yizhong", "Xiaojun Bi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bi:Xiaojun", "Xiangshi Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiangshi"], "pages": 10}
