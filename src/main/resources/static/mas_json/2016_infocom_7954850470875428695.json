The scheme can be seen as a simple extension to the Foschini-Miljanic algorithm which takes the transmit queue sizes at the mobile stations into account. The proposed scheme minimizes the draining time compared to all other policies with the same power consumption. This is because of resource pooling effects which arise when all queues empty at the same time. Although in CDMA systems there is no idle capacity as in wired systems, greater cummulative service is obtained by simultaneous transmissions than through time-sharing. Simulations exhibit significant reductions in queueing delay compared to other power control schemes proposed in the literature.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Athens University of Economics and Business", "Athens University of Economics and Business"], "authors": ["Antonis Dimakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimakis:Antonis", "Spyros Papafragkos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papafragkos:Spyros"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
