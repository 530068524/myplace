{"title": "Finger on the pulse: identifying deprivation using transit flow analysis.", "fields": ["public transport", "urban planning", "human computer interaction", "flow", "well being"], "abstract": "A common metaphor to describe the movement of people within a city is that of blood flowing through the veins of a living organism. We often speak of the 'pulse of the city' when referring to flow patterns we observe. Here we extend this metaphor by hypothesising that by monitoring the flow of people through a city we can assess the city's health, as a nurse takes a patient's heart-rate and blood pressure during a routine health check. Using an automated fare collection dataset of journeys made on the London rail system, we build a classification model that identifies areas of high deprivation as measured by the  Indices of Multiple Deprivation , and achieve a precision, sensitivity and specificity of 0.805, 0.733 and 0.810, respectively. We conclude with a discussion of the potential benefits this work provides to city planning, policymaking, and citizen engagement initiatives.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University College London", "Yahoo!", "University College London"], "authors": ["Chris Smith-Clarke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith=Clarke:Chris", "Daniele Quercia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quercia:Daniele", "Licia Capra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capra:Licia"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
