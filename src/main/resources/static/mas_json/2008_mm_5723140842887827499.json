But it is currently unclear how to best adapt higher resolution TV content. In this paper, we describe a laboratory study with 35 participants who watched short clips of different content and shot types on a 200ppi PDA display at a resolution of either 120x90 or 168x128. Participants selected their preferred size and rated the acceptability of the visual experience. The preferred viewing ratio depended on the resolution and had to be at least 9.8H. The minimal angular resolution people required and which limited the up-scaling factor was 14 pixels per degree. Extreme long shots were best when depicted actors were at least 0.7\u00b0 high. A second study researched the ecological validity of previous lab results by comparing them to results from the field. Image size yielded more value for users in the field than was apparent from lab results. In conclusion, current prediction models based on preferred viewing distances for TV and large displays do not predict viewing preferences on mobile devices. Our results will help to further the understanding of multimedia perception and service designers to deliver both economically viable and enjoyable experiences.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Hendrik Knoche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knoche:Hendrik", "Martina Angela Sasse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sasse:Martina_Angela"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
