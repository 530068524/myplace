{"title": "Solving the compressible navier-stokes equations on up to 1.97 million cores and 4.1 trillion grid points.", "fields": ["q systems", "grid", "direct numerical simulation", "performance studies", "solver"], "abstract": "We present weak and strong scaling studies as well as performance analyses of the  Hybrid  code, a finite-difference solver of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on structured grids used for the direct numerical simulation of isotropic turbulence and its interaction with shock waves. Parallelization is achieved through MPI, emphasizing the use of non-blocking communication with concurrent computation. The simulations, scaling and performance studies were done on the  Sequoia, Vulcan  and  Vesta  Blue Gene/Q systems, the first two accounting for a total of 1,966,080 cores when used in combination. The maximum number of grid points simulated was 4.12 trillion, with a memory usage of approximately 1.6 PB. We discuss the use of hyperthreading, which significantly improves the parallel performance of the code on this architecture.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Iv\u00e1n Bermejo-Moreno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bermejo=Moreno:Iv=aacute=n", "Julien Bodart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodart:Julien", "Johan Larsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsson:Johan", "Blaise M.
