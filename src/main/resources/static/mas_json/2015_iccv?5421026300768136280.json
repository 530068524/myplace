The tree structure model is simple and convenient for exact inference, but short in modeling the occlusion coherence especially in the case of self-occlusion. We propose an occlusion aware graphical model which is able to model both self-occlusion and occlusion by the other objects simultaneously. The proposed model structure can encodes the interactions between human body parts and objects, and hence enables it to learn occlusion coherence from data discriminatively. We evaluate our model on several public benchmarks for human pose estimation including challenging subsets featuring significant occlusion. The experimental results show that our method obtains comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-arts, and is robust to occlusion for 2D human pose estimation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Lianrui Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Lianrui", "Junge Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Junge", "Kaiqi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Kaiqi"], "pages": 9}
