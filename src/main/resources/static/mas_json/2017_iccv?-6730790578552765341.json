Existing methods typically train classifiers for a pre-defined list of actions and apply them in a sliding window fashion. However, activities in the wild consist of a wide combination of actors, actions and objects; it is difficult to design a proper activity list that meets users\u2019 needs. We propose to localize activities by natural language queries. Temporal Activity Localization via Language (TALL) is challenging as it requires: (1) suitable design of text and video representations to allow cross-modal matching of actions and language queries; (2) ability to locate actions accurately given features from sliding windows of limited granularity. We propose a novel Cross-modal Temporal Regression Localizer (CTRL) to jointly model text query and video clips, output alignment scores and action boundary regression results for candidate clips. Lor evaluation, we adopt TaCoS dataset, and build a new dataset for this task on top of Charades by adding sentence temporal annotations, called Charades-STA. We also build complex sentence queries in Charades-STA for test. Experimental results show that CTRL outperforms previous methods significantly on both datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Google", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jiyang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jiyang", "Chen Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Chen", "Zhenheng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhenheng", "Ram Nevatia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nevatia:Ram"], "pages": 9}
