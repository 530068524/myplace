{"title": "'Knowing Whether' in Proper Epistemic Knowledge Bases.", "fields": ["syntax", "logical consequence", "epistemic modal logic", "multi agent system", "modal operator"], "abstract": "Proper epistemic knowledge bases (PEKBs) are syntactic knowledge bases that use multi-agent epistemic logic to represent nested multi-agent knowledge and belief. PEKBs have certain syntactic restrictions that lead to desirable computational properties; primarily, a PEKB is a conjunction of modal literals, and therefore contains no disjunction. Sound entailment can be checked in polynomial time, and is complete for a large set of arbitrary formulae in logics Kn and KDn. In this paper, we extend PEKBs to deal with a restricted form of disjunction: 'knowing whether'. An agent i knows whether \u03c6 iff agent i knows \u03c6 or knows \u00ac\u03c6; that is, \u20dei\u03c6 V \u20dei\u00ac\u03c6. In our experience, the ability to represent that an agent knows whether something holds is useful in many multi-agent domains. We represent knowing whether with a modal operator, \u0394i, and present sound polynomial-time entailment algorithms on PEKBs with \u0394i in Kn and KDn, but which are complete for a smaller class of queries than standard PEKBs.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Tim Miller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miller:Tim", "Paolo Felli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felli:Paolo", "Christian J.
