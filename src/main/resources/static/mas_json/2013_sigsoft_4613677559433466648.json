Based on concrete and symbolic executions of a concurrent program, (con)2colic testing derives inputs and schedules such that the execution space of the program under investigation is systematically explored. We introduce interference scenarios as key concept in (con)2colic testing. Interference scenarios capture the flow of data among different threads and enable a unified representation of path and interference constraints. We have implemented a (con)2colic testing engine and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by experiments.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Vienna University of Technology", "University of Toronto", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Azadeh Farzan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farzan:Azadeh", "Andreas Holzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holzer:Andreas", "Niloofar Razavi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Razavi:Niloofar", "Helmut Veith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veith:Helmut"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 11}
