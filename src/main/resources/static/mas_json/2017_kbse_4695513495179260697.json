{"title": "Parsimony: an IDE for example-guided synthesis of lexers and parsers.", "fields": ["parsing", "software design pattern", "development environment", "workflow", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "We present Parsimony, a programming-by-example development environment for synthesizing lexers and parsers by example. Parsimony provides a graphical interface in which the user presents examples simply by selecting and labeling sample text in a text editor. An underlying synthesis engine then constructs syntactic rules to solve the system of constraints induced by the supplied examples. Parsimony is more expressive and usable than prior programming-by-example systems for parsers in several ways: Parsimony can (1) synthesize lexer rules in addition to productions, (2) solve for much larger constraint systems over multiple examples, rather than handling examples one-at-a-time, and (3) infer much more complex sets of productions, such as entire algebraic expression grammars, by detecting instances of well-known grammar design patterns. The results of a controlled user study across 18 participants show that users are able to perform lexing and parsing tasks faster and with fewer mistakes when using Parsimony as compared to a traditional parsing workflow.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Alan Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Alan", "Sorin Lerner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerner:Sorin"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
