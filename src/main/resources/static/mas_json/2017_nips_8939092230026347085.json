{"title": "Improving Regret Bounds for Combinatorial Semi-Bandits with Probabilistically Triggered Arms and Its Applications.", "fields": ["exponential growth", "bounded function", "maximization", "regret", "smoothness"], "abstract": "We study combinatorial multi-armed bandit with probabilistically triggered arms (CMAB-T) and semi-bandit feedback. We resolve a serious issue in the prior CMAB-T studies where the regret bounds contain a possibly exponentially large factor of 1/p*, where p* is the minimum positive probability that an arm is triggered by any action. We address this issue by introducing a triggering probability modulated (TPM) bounded smoothness condition into the influence maximization bandit and combinatorial cascading bandit satisfy this TPM condition. As a result, we completely remove the factor of 1/p* from the regret bounds, achieving significantly better regret bounds for influence maximization and cascading bandits than before. Finally, we provide lower bound results showing that the factor 1/p* is unavoidable for general CMAB-T problems, suggesting that the TPM condition is crucial in removing this factor.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Qinshi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qinshi", "Wei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wei"], "pages": 11}
