Surface computing is very promising for these application domains but not fully explored yet. In this paper we contribute two tools which support layout tasks on interactive displays: interactive grids and multi-touch alignment guides. Both tools allow the precise positioning of graphical objects in a flexible and fluent way by multi-touch input. Direct bimanual interaction and physical metaphors are applied to arrange objects along straight lines and curves. A formative user evaluation showed promising results with regard to a productive and easy use of the tools.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg", "Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg", "Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg", "Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mathias Frisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frisch:Mathias", "Sebastian Kleinau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleinau:Sebastian", "Ricardo Langner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langner:Ricardo", "Raimund Dachselt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dachselt:Raimund"], "pages": 4}
