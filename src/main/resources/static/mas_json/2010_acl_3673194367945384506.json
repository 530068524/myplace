{"title": "Computing Weakest Readings.", "fields": ["machine learning", "natural language processing", "grammar", "artificial intelligence", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "We present an efficient algorithm for computing the weakest readings of semantically ambiguous sentences. A corpus-based evaluation with a large-scale grammar shows that our algorithm reduces over 80% of sentences to one or two readings, in negligible runtime, and thus makes it possible to work with semantic representations derived by deep large-scale grammars.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Alexander Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Alexander", "Stefan Thater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thater:Stefan"], "pages": 10}
