Initial results from a large online survey are also considered. This research focuses not only on \"conservation behavior\" but importantly investigates interactions with technology that may be characterized as \"normal consumption\" or \"over-consumption.\" A novel vocabulary for analyzing and designing energy-conserving interactions is proposed based on our findings, including: cutting, trimming, switching, upgrading, and shifting. Using the proposed vocabulary, and informed by theoretical developments from various literatures, this paper demonstrates ways in which everyday interactions with technology in the home are performed without conscious consideration of energy consumption but rather are unconscious, habitual, and irrational. Implications for the design of energy-conserving interactions with technology and broader challenges for HCI research are proposed.", "citation": "Citations (214)", "departments": ["PARC", "Yahoo!", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["James Pierce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pierce:James", "Diane J.
