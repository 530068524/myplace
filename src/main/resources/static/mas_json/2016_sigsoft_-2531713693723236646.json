{"title": "Crash consistency validation made easy.", "fields": ["sort", "snapshot", "crash reporter", "software quality", "crash"], "abstract": "Software should behave correctly even in adverse conditions. Particularly, we study the problem of automated validation of crash consistency, i.e., file system data safety when systems crash. Existing work requires non-trivial manual efforts of specifying checking scripts and workloads, which is an obstacle for software developers. Therefore, we propose C3, a novel approach that makes crash consistency validation as easy as pressing a single button. With a program and an input, C3 automatically reports inconsistent crash sites. C3 not only exempts developers from the need of writing crash site checking scripts (by an algorithm that computes editing distance between file system snapshots) but also reduces the reliance on dedicated workloads (by test amplification). We implemented C3 as an open-source tool. With C3, we found 14 bugs in open-source software that have severe consequences at crash and 11 of them were previously unknown to the developers, including in highly mature software (e.g., GNU zip and GNU coreutils sort) and popular ones being actively developed (e.g., Adobe Brackets and TeXstudio).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Yanyan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0001:Yanyan", "Haicheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Haicheng", "Feng Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Feng", "Chang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Chang", "Xiaoxing Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaoxing", "Jian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0001:Jian"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
