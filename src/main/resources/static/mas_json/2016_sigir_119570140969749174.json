{"title": "The LExR Collection for Expertise Retrieval in Academia.", "fields": ["human computer information retrieval", "profiling", "data mining", "computer science", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Expertise retrieval has been the subject of intense research over the past decade, particularly with the public availability of benchmark test collections for expertise retrieval in enterprises. Another domain which has seen comparatively less research on expertise retrieval is academic search. In this paper, we describe the Lattes Expertise Retrieval (LExR) test collection for research on academic expertise retrieval. LExR has been designed to provide a large-scale benchmark for two complementary expertise retrieval tasks, namely, expert profiling and expert finding. Unlike currently available test collections, which fully support only one of these tasks, LExR provides graded relevance judgments performed by expert judges separately for each task. In addition, LExR is both cross-organization and cross-area, encompassing candidate experts from all areas of knowledge working in research institutions all over Brazil. As a result, it constitutes a valuable resource for fostering new research directions on expertise retrieval in an academic setting.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"], "authors": ["V\u00edtor Mangaravite.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mangaravite:V=iacute=tor", "Rodrygo L.
