These culminated in the design of our final game, Forest, which was conceived for the San Francisco non-profit Friends of the Urban Forest (FUF), who have been planting and caring for the city's street trees for 30 years. By incorporating real-world actions and behaviors into digital games, we can create experiences that both enhance our understanding of the world around us and provide incentive structures towards our personal, community, or societal goals.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["California College of the Arts", "California College of the Arts"], "authors": ["Jason Linder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linder:Jason", "Wendy Ju.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ju:Wendy"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
