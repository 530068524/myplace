{"title": "Simple vs Optimal Contests with Convex Costs.", "fields": ["optimal mechanism", "regular polygon", "contest", "optimal design", "quartile"], "abstract": "We study an optimal contest design problem where contributors abilities are private, their costs are convex as a function of their effort, and the designer seeks to maximize their total effort. We address the design of approximately optimal mechanisms that are robust in that they are independent of the ability distribution and the precise form of the cost function. We show that a very simple all-pay contest where the prize is distributed equally among the top quartile of contributors is always a constant factor approximation to the optimal for a large class of convex cost functions, when the number of contributors is larger than some constant. This result stands in contrast to contests with linear costs, where awarding a prize to a single top contributor is approximately-optimal; when costs are convex, this latter allocation is far from optimal. Our result is enabled by novel results in the space of optimal mechanism design with convex costs, which could be of independent interest. Finally, we validate the performance of our approximately-optimal contests via simulation experiments, and portray much better empirical performance than the worst-case guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Amy Greenwald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenwald:Amy", "Takehiro Oyakawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oyakawa:Takehiro", "Vasilis Syrgkanis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Syrgkanis:Vasilis"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
