Its decidability status is known for some individual types of infinite-state systems such as pushdown (decidable) and vector addition systems (undecidable).   This work aims at a general understanding of which types of systems admit decidability. As a unifying model, we employ valence systems over graph monoids, which feature a finite-state control and are parameterized by a monoid to represent their storage mechanism. As special cases, this includes pushdown systems, various types of counter systems (such as vector addition systems) and combinations thereof. Our main result is a characterization of those graph monoids where FO[R] is decidable for the resulting transition systems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"], "authors": ["Emanuele D'Osualdo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=Osualdo:Emanuele", "Roland Meyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyer:Roland", "Georg Zetzsche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zetzsche:Georg"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
