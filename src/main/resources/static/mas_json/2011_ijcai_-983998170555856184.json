It details how AstonCAT-Plus accepts shouts, clears market, sets transaction prices and charges fees. Through empirical evaluation, we show that AstonCAT-Plus not only outperforms AstonCAT (tournament version) significantly but also achieves the second best overall score against some top entrants of the competition. In particular, it achieves the highest allocative efficiency, transaction success rate and average trader profit among all the specialists in our controlled experiments.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Aston University", "Aston University", "City University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Meng Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Meng", "Minghua He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Minghua", "Xudong Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Xudong"], "pages": 6}
