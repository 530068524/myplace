Three-dimensionalization of the data extracted from video cameras is achieved by an algorithm that uses the Manhattan structure of the urban scene to automatically estimate the camera pose. Thus, if the pose of the video camera changes, our system will automatically update the corresponding projection matrix to maintain accurate geo-location of the scene dynamics.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["York University", "York University", "York University", "York University", "York University"], "authors": ["Eduardo R.
