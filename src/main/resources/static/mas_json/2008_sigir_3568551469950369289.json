Many different effective smoothing methods have been proposed, which mostly implement various heuristics to exploit corpus structures. In this paper, we propose a general and unified optimization framework for smoothing language models on graph structures. This framework not only provides a unified formulation of the existing smoothing heuristics, but also serves as a road map for systematically exploring smoothing methods for language models. We follow this road map and derive several different instantiations of the framework. Some of the instantiations lead to novel smoothing methods. Empirical results show that all such instantiations are effective with some outperforming the state of the art smoothing methods.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Qiaozhu Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Qiaozhu", "Duo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Duo", "ChengXiang Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:ChengXiang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
