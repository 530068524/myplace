{"title": "Designing for Cohabitation: Naturecultures, Hybrids, and Decentering the Human in Design.", "fields": ["urbanization", "politics", "cohabitation", "phenology", "urban informatics"], "abstract": "Recent research in urban informatics has presented the city as both a complex technological center and a diverse cultural, social, and political entity. However, there has been little research into the changing role that nature plays in urban space, particularly when it comes to understanding how animals have adapted to life in technological and networked cities. In the wake of urbanization, new kinds of cohabitation, including increased interactions between humans and animals, has resulted in new challenges for those working in urban informatics. We leverage key concepts in the Anthropocene-naturecultures, hybrids, and decentering the human in design-to unpack the entanglements of animal-human-computer interaction in two design cases: The Big Cat Behavioral Tracking Initiative and The Phenology Clock. We contribute to urban informatics and HCI research by reflecting on ways in which design can promote new forms of cohabitation and support a broader conception of the city that sees animals as an essential part of the urban landscape.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Nancy Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Nancy", "Shaowen Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Shaowen", "Jeffrey Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Jeffrey"], "pages": 12}
