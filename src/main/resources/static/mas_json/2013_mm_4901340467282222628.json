{"title": "Action recognition using invariant features under unexampled viewing conditions.", "fields": ["invariant", "computer vision", "autoencoder", "skeleton", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "A great challenge in real-world applications of action recognition is the lack of sufficient label information because of variance in the recording viewpoint and differences between individuals. A system that can adapt itself according to these variances is required for practical use. We present a generic method for extracting view-invariant features from skeleton joints. These view-invariant features are further refined using a stacked, compact autoencoder. To model the challenge of real-world applications, two unexampled test settings (NewView and NewPerson) are used to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results with these test settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Litian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Litian", "Kiyoharu Aizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aizawa:Kiyoharu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
