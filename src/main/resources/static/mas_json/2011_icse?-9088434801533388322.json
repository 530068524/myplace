Their advantages are well recognized in product line methods. Unfortunately, creating a feature model for an existing project is time-consuming and requires substantial effort from a modeler.   We present procedures for reverse engineering feature models based on a crucial heuristic for identifying parents - the major challenge of this task. We also automatically recover constructs such as feature groups, mandatory features, and implies/excludes edges. We evaluate the technique on two large-scale software product lines with existing reference feature models--the Linux and eCos kernels--and FreeBSD, a project without a feature model. Our heuristic is effective across all three projects by ranking the correct parent among the top results for a vast majority of features. The procedures effectively reduce the information a modeler has to consider from thousands of choices to typically five or less.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Leipzig University", "IT University of Copenhagen", "University of Waterloo", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Kaunas University of Technology", "Kaunas University of Technology"], "authors": ["Steven She.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/She:Steven", "Rafael Lotufo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lotufo:Rafael", "Thorsten Berger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berger:Thorsten", "Andrzej Wasowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wasowski:Andrzej", "Krzysztof Czarnecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czarnecki:Krzysztof"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
