We identify performance limitations in this context, and propose an array of techniques to lift them. First, we adapt the DHT platform's index store and communication primitives to the needs of massive data processing. Second, we introduce a distributed hierarchical index and associated efficient algorithms to speed up query processing. Third, we present an innovative, XML-specific flavor of Bloom filters, to reduce data transfers entailed by query processing. Our approach is fully implemented in the KadoP system, used in a real-life software manufacturing application. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of the proposed techniques.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Serge Abiteboul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abiteboul:Serge", "Ioana Manolescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manolescu:Ioana", "Neoklis Polyzotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polyzotis:Neoklis", "Nicoleta Preda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Preda:Nicoleta", "Chong Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Chong"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
