{"title": "A Statistical Model for Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Transliteration Mining.", "fields": ["machine learning", "statistical model", "transliteration", "natural language processing", "interpolation"], "abstract": "We propose a novel model to automatically extract transliteration pairs from parallel corpora. Our model is efficient, language pair independent and mines transliteration pairs in a consistent fashion in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We model transliteration mining as an interpolation of transliteration and non-transliteration sub-models. We evaluate on NEWS 2010 shared task data and on parallel corpora with competitive results.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hassan Sajjad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sajjad:Hassan", "Alexander M.
