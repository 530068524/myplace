Bottleneck max fairness (BMF) is a sharing objective in this context with good performance. The paper shows that BMF results when local fairness is imposed at each resource while flow rates are controlled by an end-to-end window. We analytically prove convergence to BMF under a fluid model when flows share a network limited to 2 resources while numerical results confirm BMF convergence for larger networks. Simulation results illustrate the impact of packetized transmission.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "Charles III University of Madrid", "SystemX, France"], "authors": ["Thomas Bonald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonald:Thomas", "James W.
