{"title": "Ad Hoc Treebank Structures.", "fields": ["treebank", "equivalence", "grammar", "annotation", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We outline the problem of ad hoc rules in treebanks, rules used for specific constructions in one data set and unlikely to be used again. These include ungeneralizable rules, erroneous rules, rules for ungrammatical text, and rules which are not consistent with the rest of the annotation scheme. Based on a simple notion of rule equivalence and on the idea of finding rules unlike any others, we develop two methods for detecting ad hoc rules in flat treebanks and show they are successful in detecting such rules. This is done by examining evidence across the grammar and without making any reference to context.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Indiana University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Markus Dickinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dickinson:Markus"], "pages": 9}
