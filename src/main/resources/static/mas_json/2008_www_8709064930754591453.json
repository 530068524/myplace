This paper is concerned with developing probabilistic models and computational algorithms for social annotations. We propose a unified framework to combine the modeling of social annotations with the language modeling-based methods for information retrieval. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering topics in the contents and annotations of documents while categorizing the users by domains; and (2) enhancing document and query language models by incorporating user domain interests as well as topical background models. In particular, we propose a new general generative model for social annotations, which is then simplified to a computationally tractable hierarchical Bayesian network. Then we apply smoothing techniques in a risk minimization framework to incorporate the topical information to language models. Experiments are carried out on a real-world annotation data set sampled from del.icio.us. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over the traditional approaches.", "citation": "Citations (237)", "departments": ["Facebook", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Pennsylvania State University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Ding Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ding", "Jiang Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Jiang", "Shuyi Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Shuyi", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan", "C.
