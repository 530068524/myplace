While there are a few studies detailing practices for finding an  expert  often in the context of an expertise locator system, there are fewer studies on workplace practices and challenges for finding a  person who can help , especially independent of any particular technology. We conducted a two-part study of helper-finding activities with 36 enterprise workers, representing different job roles and levels of experience. First, we present a taxonomy of workplace helper-finding needs that involves  tasks, topics , and  helper selection criteria , developed by analyzing two weeks of participant diaries describing helper-finding problems. Second, we present the results of follow-up interviews with each participant, focusing on helper-finding challenges in the workplace. Finally, we present design implications for systems aimed at supporting helper-finding in the workplace.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["AT&T", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Svetlana Yarosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yarosh:Svetlana", "Tara Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Tara", "Michelle X.
