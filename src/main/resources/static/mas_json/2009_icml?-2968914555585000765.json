To overcome such problems, we propose a full Bayesian treatment of the Group-Lasso, extending the standard Bayesian Lasso, using hierarchical expansion. The method is then applied to Poisson models for contingency tables using a highly efficient MCMC algorithm. The simulated experiments validate the performance of this method on artificial datasets with known ground-truth. When applied to a breast cancer dataset, the method demonstrates the capability of identifying the differences in interactions patterns of marker proteins between different patient groups.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["University of Basel", "ETH Zurich", "University of Zurich", "University of Basel", "University Hosp ...
