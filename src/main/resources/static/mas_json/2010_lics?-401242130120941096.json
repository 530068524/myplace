The model is rich enough to embody the semantics of generalised stochastic Petri nets. We define strong and weak bisimulations and discuss their compositionality properties. Weak bisimulation is partly oblivious to the probabilistic branching structure, in order to reflect some natural equalities in this spectrum of models. As a result, the standard way to associate a stochastic process to a generalised stochastic Petri net can be proven sound with respect to weak bisimulation.", "citation": "Citations (141)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Information Technology University"], "authors": ["Christian Eisentraut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisentraut:Christian", "Holger Hermanns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hermanns:Holger", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lijun"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
