{"title": "GUIDE: a scalable information directory service to collect, federate, and analyze logs for operational insights into a leadership HPC facility.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "directory service", "scalability", "raw data", "data warehouse"], "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the GUIDE framework used to collect, federate, and analyze log data from the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), and how we use that data to derive insights into facility operations. We collect system logs and extract monitoring data at every level of the various OLCF subsystems, and have developed a suite of pre-processing tools to make the raw data consumable. The cleansed logs are then ingested and federated into a central, scalable data warehouse, Splunk, that offers storage, indexing, querying, and visualization capabilities. We have further developed and deployed a set of tools to analyze these multiple disparate log streams in concert and derive operational insights. We describe our experience from developing and deploying the GUIDE infrastructure, and deriving valuable insights on the various subsystems, based on two years of operations in the production OLCF environment.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Northeastern University", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Sudharshan S.
