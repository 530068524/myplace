{"title": "A semantic account of metric preservation.", "fields": ["metric differential", "equivalence of metrics", "intrinsic metric", "metric map", "injective metric space"], "abstract": "Program sensitivity  measures how robust a program is to small changes in its input, and is a fundamental notion in domains ranging from differential privacy to cyber-physical systems. A natural way to formalize program sensitivity is in terms of metrics on the input and output spaces, requiring that an  r -sensitive function map inputs that are at distance  d  to outputs that are at distance at most  r  \ufffd\u00b7  d . Program sensitivity is thus an analogue of Lipschitz continuity for programs.   Reed and Pierce introduced  Fuzz , a functional language with a linear type system that can express program sensitivity. They show soundness operationally, in the form of a  metric preservation  property. Inspired by their work, we study program sensitivity and metric preservation from a denotational point of view. In particular, we introduce  metric CPOs , a novel semantic structure for reasoning about computation on metric spaces, by endowing CPOs with a compatible notion of distance. This structure is useful for reasoning about metric properties of programs, and specifically about program sensitivity. We demonstrate metric CPOs by giving a model for the deterministic fragment of Fuzz.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University at Buffalo", "University of Pennsylvania", "Kyoto University", "ENS, France"], "authors": ["Arthur Azevedo de Amorim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amorim:Arthur_Azevedo_de", "Marco Gaboardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaboardi:Marco", "Justin Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Justin", "Shin-ya Katsumata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katsumata:Shin=ya", "Ikram Cherigui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherigui:Ikram"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
