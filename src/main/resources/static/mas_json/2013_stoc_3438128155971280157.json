By establishing connections between the complexity of computing these averages and the location of the complex zeros of the partition function, we show that these averages are #P-hard to compute, and hence, under standard assumptions, computationally intractable. In the case of the Ising model, our approach requires us to prove an extension of the famous Lee\u2013Yang Theorem from the 1950s.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Alistair Sinclair.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinclair:Alistair", "Piyush Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Piyush"], "pages": 10}
