The navigation in the diagrams becomes a major problem especially if different aspects of the system are scattered over multiple, only loosely coupled diagrams.   In this paper we present the hierarchical navigation capabilities of the Adora modeling tool. The user of this tool can freely control the level of detail in different parts of the model to reduce the size and complexity of the diagrams being displayed. Our fisheye visualization technique makes it possible to integrate all modeling aspects (structure, data, behavior, etc.) in one coherent model while keeping the size and complexity of the diagrams within reasonable limits.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "University of Zurich"], "authors": ["Tobias Reinhard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reinhard:Tobias", "Silvio Meier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meier:Silvio", "Reinhard Stoiber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoiber:Reinhard", "Christina Cramer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cramer:Christina", "Martin Glinz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glinz:Martin"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
