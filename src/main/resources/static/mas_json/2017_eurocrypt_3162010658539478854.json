Despite being the de facto standard for modern secure processors, the \u201cattested execution\u201d abstraction has not received adequate formal treatment. We provide formal abstractions for \u201cattested execution\u201d secure processors and rigorously explore its expressive power. Our explorations show both the expected and the surprising.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael", "Elaine Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Elaine", "Florian Tram\u00e8r.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tram=egrave=r:Florian"], "pages": 30}
