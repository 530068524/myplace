This paper is concerned with the problem of question retrieval. Question retrieval in Q&A archives aims to find historical questions that are semantically equivalent or relevant to the queried questions. In this paper, we propose a novel phrase-based translation model for question retrieval. Compared to the traditional word-based translation models, the phrase-based translation model is more effective because it captures contextual information in modeling the translation of phrases as a whole, rather than translating single words in isolation. Experiments conducted on real Q&A data demonstrate that our proposed phrase-based translation model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art word-based translation model.", "citation": "Citations (121)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Guangyou Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guangyou", "Li Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Li", "Jun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Jun", "Kang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Kang"], "pages": 10}
