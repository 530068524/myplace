Given  u  1 , \u2026,  u   n  , the squared distance (to the set of exact solutions) is defined as inf  v   \u2211  i =1   n   ||  u   i   \u2212  v   i   || 2  2  where the infimum is over the set of exact solutions. Previous results show that the squared distance of any \u0454-nearly solution is at most  O ( poly ( d , n ,\u0454)) and there are \u0454-nearly solutions with squared distance at least \u03a9( d  \u0454). The fundamental open question is whether the squared distance can be independent of the number of vectors  n .    We answer this question affirmatively by proving that the squared distance of any \u0454-nearly solution is  O ( d  13/2  \u0454). Our approach is based on a continuous version of the operator scaling algorithm and consists of two parts. First, we define a dynamical system based on operator scaling and use it to prove that the squared distance of any \u0454-nearly solution is  O ( d  2   n  \u0454). Then, we show that by randomly perturbing the input vectors, the dynamical system will converge faster and the squared distance of an \u0454-nearly solution is  O ( d  5/2  \u0454) when  n  is large enough and \u0454 is small enough. To analyze the convergence of the dynamical system, we develop some new techniques in lower bounding the operator capacity, a concept introduced by Gurvits to analyzing the operator scaling algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Tsz Chiu Kwok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwok:Tsz_Chiu", "Lap Chi Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Lap_Chi", "Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "Akshay Ramachandran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramachandran:Akshay"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
