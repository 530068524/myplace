{"title": "Orion 2.0: native support for uncertain data.", "fields": ["database theory", "probabilistic database", "database engine", "first class", "uncertain data"], "abstract": "Orion is a state-of-the-art uncertain database management system with built-in support for probabilistic data as first class data types. In contrast to other uncertain databases, Orion supports both attribute and tuple uncertainty with arbitrary correlations. This enables the database engine to handle both discrete and continuous pdfs in a natural and accurate manner. The underlying model is closed under the basic relational operators and is consistent with Possible Worlds Semantics. We demonstrate how Orion simplifies the design and enhances the capabilities of two example applications: managing sensor data (continuous uncertainty) and inferring missing values (discrete uncertainty).", "citation": "Citations (133)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sarvjeet Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Sarvjeet", "Chris Mayfield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayfield:Chris", "Sagar Mittal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mittal:Sagar", "Sunil Prabhakar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakar:Sunil", "Susanne E.
