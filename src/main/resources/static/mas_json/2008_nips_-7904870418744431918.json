Our model is based on the recently proposed hidden conditional random field (hCRF) for object recognition. Similar to hCRF for object recognition, we model a human action by a flexible constellation of parts conditioned on image observations. Different from object recognition, our model combines both large-scale global features and local patch features to distinguish various actions. Our experimental results show that our model is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches in action recognition. In particular, our experimental results demonstrate that combining large-scale global features and local patch features performs significantly better than directly applying hCRF on local patches alone.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Yang", "Greg Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Greg"], "pages": 8}
