We formalize a definition of multiparty computation secure against adaptive auxiliary information (AAI-MPC), that intuitively guarantees that such an adversary learns no more than the function output and the adaptive auxiliary information. In particular, if the auxiliary information contains only partial, \u201cnoisy,\u201d or computationally invertible information on secret inputs, then only such information should be revealed.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Boston University", "Microsoft", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Elette Boyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boyle:Elette", "Sanjam Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Sanjam", "Abhishek Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0002:Abhishek", "Yael Tauman Kalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalai:Yael_Tauman", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 19}
