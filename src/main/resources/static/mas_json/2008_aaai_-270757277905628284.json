Each fragment is evaluated w.r.t. several criteria, including the complexity of basic quaries and transformation, and its spatial efficiency is also analysed.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Paul Sabatier University", "university of lille"], "authors": ["H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fargier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fargier:H=eacute=l=egrave=ne", "Pierre Marquis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marquis:Pierre"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
