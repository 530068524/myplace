From an input video, we extract salient spatio-temporal structures by forming clusters of trajectories that serve as candidates for the parts of an action. The assembly of these clusters into an action class is governed by a graphical model that incorporates appearance and motion constraints for the individual parts and pairwise constraints for the spatio-temporal dependencies among them. During training, we estimate the model parameters discriminatively. During classification, we efficiently match the model to a video using discrete optimization. We validate the model's classification ability in standard benchmark datasets and illustrate its potential to support a fine-grained analysis that not only gives a label to a video, but also identifies and localizes its constituent parts.", "citation": "Citations (232)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michalis Raptis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raptis:Michalis", "Iasonas Kokkinos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kokkinos:Iasonas", "Stefano Soatto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soatto:Stefano"], "pages": 8}
