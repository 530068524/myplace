To keep up with the changes, software companies need effective methods of knowledge transfer. In the paper a 3-step approach to knowledge transfer, called Technical Drama, is presented. The paper is focused on transferring knowledge concerning architecture evaluation, but the approach could also be applied to transferring knowledge concerning inspections, testing etc. It is claimed in the paper that the Technical Drama can be useful in the industrial context (two case studies are described) as well as at university (then a kind of software studio is required).", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Pozna\u0144 University of Technology", "Pozna\u0144 University of Technology", "Pozna\u0144 University of Technology"], "authors": ["Bartosz Michalik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michalik:Bartosz", "Jerzy R.
