Even for the binary case \\(Q=2\\), our decryption circuit has a smaller degree than that of the previous scheme; the multiplicative degree is reduced from \\(O(\\lambda (\\log \\lambda )^2)\\) to \\(O(\\lambda )\\), where \\(\\lambda \\) is the security parameter. We also extend our FHE scheme to a batch FHE scheme.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "National Presto Industries", "Ibaraki University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Koji Nuida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nuida:Koji", "Kaoru Kurosawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurosawa:Kaoru"], "pages": 19}
