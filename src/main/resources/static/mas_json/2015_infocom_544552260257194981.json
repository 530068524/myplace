We find evidence that connection speeds are important and that external events can have a huge impact for live TV usage. Then, through a temporal analysis of the access logs, we demonstrate that data usage caps imposed by mobile ISPs significantly affect usage patterns, and look for solutions. We show that product bundle discounts with a related fixed-line ISP, a strategy already employed by some mobile providers, can better support user needs and capture a bigger share of accesses. We observe that users regularly split their sessions between mobile and fixed-line connections, suggesting a straightforward strategy for offloading by speculatively pre-fetching content from a fixed-line ISP before access on mobile devices.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["King's College London", "King's College London", "BBC R&D, London, UK", "BBC R&D, London, UK"], "authors": ["Dmytro Karamshuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karamshuk:Dmytro", "Nishanth Sastry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sastry:Nishanth", "Andrew Secker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Secker:Andrew", "Jigna Chandaria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandaria:Jigna"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
