Typically GDL systems use meta-reasoning capabilities over a base reasoner, identifying learning goals and devising strategies. In this paper we present a novel GDL technique to deal with complex AI systems where the meta-reasoning module has to analyze the reasoning trace of multiple components with potentially different learning paradigms. Our approach works by distributing the generation of learning strategies among the different modules instead of centralizing it in the meta-reasoner. We implemented our technique in the GILA system, that works in the airspace task orders domain, showing an increase in performance.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jainarayan Radhakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radhakrishnan:Jainarayan", "Santiago Onta\u00f1\u00f3n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onta=ntilde==oacute=n:Santiago", "Ashwin Ram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ram:Ashwin"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
