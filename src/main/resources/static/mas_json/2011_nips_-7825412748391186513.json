{"title": "The Manifold Tangent Classifier.", "fields": ["atlas", "manifold alignment", "feature learning", "local tangent space alignment", "statistical manifold"], "abstract": "We combine three important ideas present in previous work for building classifiers: the semi-supervised hypothesis (the input distribution contains information about the classifier), the unsupervised manifold hypothesis (data density concentrates near low-dimensional manifolds), and the manifold hypothesis for classification (different classes correspond to disjoint manifolds separated by low density). We exploit a novel algorithm for capturing manifold structure (high-order contractive auto-encoders) and we show how it builds a topological atlas of charts, each chart being characterized by the principal singular vectors of the Jacobian of a representation mapping. This representation learning algorithm can be stacked to yield a deep architecture, and we combine it with a domain knowledge-free version of the TangentProp algorithm to encourage the classifier to be insensitive to local directions changes along the manifold. Record-breaking classification results are obtained.", "citation": "Citations (178)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Salah Rifai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rifai:Salah", "Yann Dauphin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dauphin:Yann", "Pascal Vincent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vincent:Pascal", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua", "Xavier Muller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muller:Xavier"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
