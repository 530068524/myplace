We first consider the arithmetic circuit complexity of computing the noncommutative determinant polynomial. Then, more generally, we also examine the complexity of algorithms computing the determinant over noncommutative domains. Our hardness results are summarized below: We show that if the noncommutative determinant polynomial has small noncommutative arithmetic circuits then so does the noncommutative permanent. Consequently, the commutative permanent polynomial has small commutative arithmetic circuits. For any field F we show that computing the n x n permanent over F is polynomial-time reducible to computing the 2n x 2n (noncommutative) determinant whose entries are O(n 2 ) x O(n 2 ) matrices over the field F. We also derive as a consequence that computing the n x n permanent over the nonnegative rationals is polynomial-time reducible to computing the noncommutative determinant over Clifford algebras of dimension n O(1) . Our techniques are elementary and use primarily the notion of the  Hadamard Product  of noncommutative polynomials introduced in an earlier paper [AJS09].", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai", "Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "The Institute o ...
