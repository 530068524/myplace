Most of existing work focused on line-based deployment, ignoring a wide spectrum of potential curve-based solutions. We, for the first time, extensively study the sensor deployment under general settings. We first present a condition under which line-based deployment is suboptimal, pointing to the advantage of curve-based deployment. By constructing a contracting mapping, we identify the characteristics for a deployment curve to be optimal. We then design sensor deployment algorithms for the optimal deployment curve by introducing a new notion of distance-continuous. Our findings show that i) when the deployment curve is distance-continuous, the proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of the vulnerability corresponding to the deployment, and ii) when the deployment curve is not distance-continuous, the approximation ratio of the vulnerability corresponding to the deployment by the proposed algorithm to the optimal one is upper bounded by min (\u03c0, ||AB||/||AGB|| 2n+\u221a(2-1)/2n), where ||AB||, ||AGB|| and n are constants. Extensive numerical results corroborate our analysis.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Shibo He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Shibo", "Xiaowen Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Xiaowen", "Junshan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Junshan", "Jiming Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiming", "Youxian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Youxian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
