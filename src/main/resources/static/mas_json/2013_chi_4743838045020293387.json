{"title": "8D: interacting with a relightable glasses-free 3D display.", "fields": ["autostereoscopy", "human computer interaction", "liquid crystal display", "computer hardware", "software"], "abstract": "We present an 8-dimensional (8D) display that allows glasses-free viewing of 3D imagery, whist capturing and reacting to incident environmental and user controlled light sources. We demonstrate two interactive possibilities enabled by our lens-array-based hardware prototype, and realtime GPU-accelerated software pipeline. Additionally, we describe a path to deploying such displays in the future, using current Sensor-in-Pixel (SIP) LCD panels, which physically collocate sensing and display elements.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Matthew Hirsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirsch:Matthew", "Shahram Izadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izadi:Shahram", "Henry Holtzman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holtzman:Henry", "Ramesh Raskar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raskar:Ramesh"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
