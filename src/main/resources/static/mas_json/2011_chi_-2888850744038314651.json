{"title": "Homeless young people and living with personal digital artifacts.", "fields": ["mobile phone", "welfare", "disposition", "digital artifact", "goodwill"], "abstract": "This paper reports on an investigation of how homeless young people hold themselves in relation to personal digital artifacts. Twelve participants, aged 19-29, took part in semi-structured interviews. Participants answered questions about the acquisition and disposition of personal artifacts, digital and non-digital, including mobile phones, music players, and wallets. The analysis of the interview transcripts reveals that young people often part with their digital artifacts in order to meet immediate needs, including the need to create and reciprocate goodwill. This contingent holding of personal artifacts illuminates both the ordinary and extraordinary circumstances of homelessness. The paper concludes with a discussion of constraints and implications for the design of information systems for improving the welfare of homeless young people.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jill Palzkill Woelfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woelfer:Jill_Palzkill", "David G.
