{"title": "Sherali-adams relaxations of the matching polytope.", "fields": ["linear programming relaxation", "integer", "complete graph", "polytope", "birkhoff polytope"], "abstract": "We study the Sherali-Adams lift-and-project hierarchy of linear programming relaxations of the matching polytope. Our main result is an asymptotically tight expression 1+1/k for the integrality gap after k rounds of this hierarchy. The result is derived by a detailed analysis of the LP after k rounds applied to the complete graph K_{2d+1}. We give an explicit recurrence for the value of this LP, and hence show that its gap exhibits a \"phase transition,\" dropping from close to its maximum value 1+1/2d to close to 1 around the threshold k=2d-\u0398(\u221ad). We also show that the rank of the matching polytope (i.e., the number of Sherali-Adams rounds until the integer polytope is reached) is exactly 2d-1.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Brown University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Claire Mathieu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathieu:Claire", "Alistair Sinclair.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinclair:Alistair"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
