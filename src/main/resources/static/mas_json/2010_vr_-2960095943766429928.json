Most of today's mobile internet devices contain facilities to display maps of the user's surroundings with points of interest embedded into the map. Other researchers have already explored complementary, egocentric visualizations of these points of interest using mobile mixed reality. However, it is challenging to display off-screen or occluded points of interest. We have designed and implemented space-distorting visualizations to address these situations. Based on the informal user feedback that we have gathered, we have performed several iterations on our visualizations. We hope that our initial results can inspire other researchers to also investigate space-distorting visualizations for mixed and augmented reality.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia"], "authors": ["Christian Sandor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandor:Christian", "Arindam Dey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dey:Arindam", "Andrew Cunningham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cunningham:Andrew", "Sebastien Barbier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbier:Sebastien", "Ulrich Eck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eck:Ulrich", "Donald Urquhart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urquhart:Donald", "Michael R.
