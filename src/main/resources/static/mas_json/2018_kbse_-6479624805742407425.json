The efficiency of the SMT solver has significant effects on the performance of these technologies. However, the current SMT solvers are designed for the general purpose of constraint solving. Many useful knowledge of programs cannot be utilized during the SMT solving. As a result, the SMT solver may spend a lot of effort to explore redundant search space. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for utilizing control-flow knowledge in SMT solving. With this technique, the search space can be considerably reduced and the efficiency of SMT solving is observably improved. We conducted extensive experiments on credible benchmarks, the results show orders of magnitude improvements of our approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jianhui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jianhui", "Fei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Fei"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
