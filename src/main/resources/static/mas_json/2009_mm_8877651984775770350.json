After matching face images by local feature points, we transform matching situations into a novel representation called visual sentences. Then, visual language models are constructed to describe the dependency of image patches on faces. With the probabilistic framework, we develop a clustering algorithm to group the same individual's face images into the same cluster. An interesting observation about evaluating face clustering performance is proposed, and we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed visual language model approach.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["National Chung Cheng University", "National Chung Cheng University", "Industrial Technology Research Institute"], "authors": ["Wei-Ta Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Wei=Ta", "Ya-Lin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Ya=Lin", "Jen-Yu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jen=Yu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
