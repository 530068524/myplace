Further, assuming a strong variant of the Decisional Diffie-Hellman Assumption, we construct a network extractor in which all parties receive private randomness. This yields an efficient protocol for secure multi-party computation with imperfect randomness, when the number of parties is at least polylog (n) and where the parties only have access to an independent source with min-entropy n Omega(1) .", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Inst. for Adv.
