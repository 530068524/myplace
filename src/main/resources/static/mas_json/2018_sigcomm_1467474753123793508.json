{"title": "Incentivizing censorship measurements via circumvention.", "fields": ["internet censorship", "software deployment", "network functions virtualization", "censorship", "dissemination"], "abstract": "We present C-Saw, a system that measures Internet censorship by offering data-driven censorship circumvention to users. The adaptive circumvention capability of C-Saw incentivizes users to opt-in by offering small page load times (PLTs). As users crowdsource, the measurement data gets richer, offering greater insights into censorship mechanisms over a wider region, and in turn leading to even better circumvention capabilities. C-Saw incorporates user consent in its design by measuring only those URLs that a user actually visits. Using a cross-platform implementation of C-Saw, we show that it is effective at collecting and disseminating censorship measurements, selecting circumvention approaches, and optimizing user experience. C-Saw improves the average PLT by up to 48% and 63% over Lantern and Tor, respectively. We demonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale deployment of C-Saw with a pilot study.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Lahore University of Management Sciences", "Lahore University of Management Sciences", "Lahore University of Management Sciences", "Lahore University of Management Sciences"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Aqib Nisar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nisar:Aqib", "Aqsa Kashaf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kashaf:Aqsa", "Ihsan Ayyub Qazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qazi:Ihsan_Ayyub", "Zartash Afzal Uzmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uzmi:Zartash_Afzal"], "pages": 14}
