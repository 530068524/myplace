{"title": "Spectral Learning of General Weighted Automata via Constrained Matrix Completion.", "fields": ["singular value decomposition", "real number", "hankel matrix", "mathematical proof", "matrix completion"], "abstract": "Many tasks in text and speech processing and computational biology require estimating functions mapping strings to real numbers. A broad class of such functions can be defined by weighted automata. Spectral methods based on the singular value decomposition of a Hankel matrix have been recently proposed for learning a probability distribution represented by a weighted automaton from a training sample drawn according to this same target distribution. In this paper, we show how spectral methods can be extended to the problem of learning a general weighted automaton from a sample generated by an arbitrary distribution. The main obstruction to this approach is that, in general, some entries of the Hankel matrix may be missing. We present a solution to this problem based on solving a constrained matrix completion problem. Combining these two ingredients, matrix completion and spectral method, a whole new family of algorithms for learning general weighted automata is obtained. We present generalization bounds for a particular algorithm in this family. The proofs rely on a joint stability analysis of matrix completion and spectral learning.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "authors": ["Borja Balle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balle:Borja", "Mehryar Mohri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohri:Mehryar"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
