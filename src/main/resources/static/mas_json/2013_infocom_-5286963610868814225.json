{"title": "Advanced metering and demand response communication performance in Zigbee based HANs.", "fields": [], "abstract": "Using IEEE 802.15.4 and Zigbee for home area networks (HANs) in the Smart Grid is becoming an increasingly prominent topic in the research area. As the standard designed for low data rate and low cost wireless personal area networks, IEEE 802.15.4 is widely employed in the construction of home sensor networks to assist with real-time environment information. For the purposes of Smart Grid the Zigbee Alliance has defined new Smart Energy Profile Protocol that leverages the existing TCP and HTTP protocols. In this paper, we provide an overview of the Smart Grid's Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Demand Response (DR) functionalities, and the communication requirement they pose for the new SEP protocol. The discussion is followed by an evaluation of the theoretical performance bounds of the new architecture based on a analytical model. We conclude, by extending the model to account for WiFi interference which is expected to be present in home and office environments.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Velin Kounev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kounev:Velin", "David Tipper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tipper:David"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
