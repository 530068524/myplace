{"title": "Hardness of Computing Individual Bits for One-Way Functions on Elliptic Curves.", "fields": ["encryption", "finite field", "pairing", "discrete fourier transform", "one way function"], "abstract": "We prove that if one can predict any of the bits of the input to an elliptic curve based one-way function over a finite field, then we can invert the function. In particular, our result implies that if one can predict any of the bits of the input to a classical pairing-based one-way function with non-negligible advantage over a random guess then one can efficiently invert this function and thus, solve the Fixed Argument Pairing Inversion problem FAPI-1/FAPI-2. The latter has implications on the security of various pairing-based schemes such as the identity-based encryption scheme of Boneh---Franklin, Hess' identity-based signature scheme, as well as Joux's three-party one-round key agreement protocol. Moreover, if one can solve FAPI-1 and FAPI-2 in polynomial time then one can solve the Computational Diffie---Hellman problem CDH in polynomial time.\n\nOur result implies that all the bits of the functions defined above are hard-to-compute assuming these functions are one-way. The argument is based on a list-decoding technique via discrete Fourier transforms due to Akavia---Goldwasser---Safra as well as an idea due to Boneh---Shparlinski.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Alexandre Duc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duc:Alexandre", "Dimitar Jetchev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jetchev:Dimitar"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 18}
