{"title": "Reliable Patch Trackers: Robust visual tracking by exploiting reliable patches.", "fields": ["tracking system", "initialization", "minimum bounding box", "eye tracking", "visual objects"], "abstract": "Most modern trackers typically employ a bounding box given in the first frame to track visual objects, where their tracking results are often sensitive to the initialization. In this paper, we propose a new tracking method, Reliable Patch Trackers (RPT), which attempts to identify and exploit the reliable patches that can be tracked effectively through the whole tracking process. Specifically, we present a tracking reliability metric to measure how reliably a patch can be tracked, where a probability model is proposed to estimate the distribution of reliable patches under a sequential Monte Carlo framework. As the reliable patches distributed over the image, we exploit the motion trajectories to distinguish them from the background. Therefore, the visual object can be defined as the clustering of homo-trajectory patches, where a Hough voting-like scheme is employed to estimate the target state. Encouraging experimental results on a large set of sequences showed that the proposed approach is very effective and in comparison to the state-of-the-art trackers. The full source code of our implementation will be publicly available.", "citation": "Citations (181)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Singapore Management University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang", "Jianke Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jianke", "Steven C.
