To take advantage of future massively parallel architectures, our algorithms are  communication-avoiding : they reduce the costs of communication across the network and the cache hierarchy. The fundamental technique underlying our work is the  randomized sparsification  of a graph: removing a fraction of graph edges, deriving a solution for such a sparsified graph, and using the result to obtain a solution for the original input. We design and implement sparsification with  O (1) synchronization steps. Our global minimum cut algorithm decreases communication costs and computation compared to the state-of-the-art, while our connected components algorithm incurs few cache misses and synchronization steps. We validate our approach by evaluating MPI implementations of the algorithms on a petascale supercomputer. We also provide an approximate variant of the minimum cut algorithm and show that it approximates the exact solutions well while using a fraction of cores in a fraction of time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Lukas Gianinazzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gianinazzi:Lukas", "Pavel Kalvoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalvoda:Pavel", "Alessandro De Palma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palma:Alessandro_De", "Maciej Besta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Besta:Maciej", "Torsten Hoefler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoefler:Torsten"], "pages": 14}
