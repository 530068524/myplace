{"title": "The Combined Approach to Query Answering Beyond the OWL 2 Profiles.", "fields": ["web ontology language", "logical consequence", "negation", "information retrieval", "underpinning", "computer science", "ontology"], "abstract": "Combined approaches have become a successful technique for CQ answering over ontologies. Existing algorithms, however, are restricted to the logics underpinning the OWL 2 profiles. Our goal is to make combined approaches applicable to a wider range of ontologies. We focus on RSA: a class of Horn ontologies that extends the profiles while ensuring tractability of standard reasoning. We show that CQ answering over RSA ontologies without role composition is feasible in NP. Our reasoning procedure generalises the combined approach for ELHO and DL-LiteR using an encoding of CQ answering into fact entailment w.r.t. a logic program with function symbols and stratified negation. Our results have significant practical implications since many out-of-profile Horn ontologies are RSA.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Wright State University", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Cristina Feier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feier:Cristina", "David Carral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carral:David", "Giorgio Stefanoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefanoni:Giorgio", "Bernardo Cuenca Grau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grau:Bernardo_Cuenca", "Ian Horrocks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horrocks:Ian"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
