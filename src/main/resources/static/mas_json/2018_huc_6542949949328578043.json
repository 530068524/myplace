Their position on the face makes it possible to capture bio-signals as well as facial expressions. This paper introduces the PhysioHMD, a software and hardware modular interface built for collecting affect and physiological data from users wearing a head-mounted display. The PhysioHMD platform is a flexible architecture enables researchers and developers to aggregate and interprets signals in real-time, and use those to develop novel, personalized interactions and evaluate virtual experiences. Offering an interface that is not only easy to extend but also is complemented by a suite of tools for testing and analysis. We hope that PhysioHMD can become a universal, publicly available testbed for VR and AR researchers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Guillermo Bernal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernal:Guillermo", "Tao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Tao", "Abhinandan Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Abhinandan", "Pattie Maes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maes:Pattie"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
