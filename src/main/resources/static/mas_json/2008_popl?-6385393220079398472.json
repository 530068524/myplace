{"title": "Generating precise and concise procedure summaries.", "fields": ["data flow diagram", "abstract interpretation", "modular design", "grey relational analysis", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "We present a framework for generating procedure summaries that are (a) precise - applying the summary in a given context yields the same result as re-analyzing the procedure in that context, and(b) concise - the summary exploits the commonalitiesin the ways the procedure manipulates abstract values, and does not contain superfluous context information.   The use of a precise and concise procedure summary inmodular analyses provides a way to capture infinitely many possible contexts in a finite way; in interprocedural analyses, it provides a compact representation of an explicit input-output summary table without loss of precision.   We define a class of abstract domains and transformers for which precise and concise summaries can be efficiently generated using our framework. Our framework is rich enough to encode a wide range of problems, including all IFDS and IDE problems. In addition, we show how the framework is instantiated to provide novel solutions to two hard problems: modular linear constant propagation and modular typestate verification, both in the presence of aliasing. We implemented a prototype of our framework that computes summaries for the typestate domain, and report on preliminary experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Greta Yorsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yorsh:Greta", "Eran Yahav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yahav:Eran", "Satish Chandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandra_0001:Satish"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2008", "pages": 14}
