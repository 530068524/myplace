SMIR is convex under mild conditions and thus improves the nonconvexity of mutual information regularization. It offers all of the following four abilities to semi-supervised algorithms: Analytical solution, out-of-sample/multi-class classification, and probabilistic output. Furthermore, novel generalization error bounds are derived. Experiments show SMIR compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Gang Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Gang", "Wittawat Jitkrittum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jitkrittum:Wittawat", "Bo Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Bo", "Hirotaka Hachiya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hachiya:Hirotaka", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
