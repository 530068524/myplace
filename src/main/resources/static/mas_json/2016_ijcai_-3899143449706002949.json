{"title": "Tabling as a Library with Delimited Control.", "fields": ["logic programming", "source lines of code", "delimited continuation", "architecture", "table", "sld resolution", "prolog"], "abstract": "Tabling is probably the most widely studied extension of Prolog. But despite its importance and practicality, tabling is not implemented by most Prolog systems. Existing approaches require substantial changes to the Prolog engine, which is an investment out of reach of most systems. To enable more widespread adoption, we present a new implementation of tabling in under 600 lines of Prolog code. Our lightweight approach relies on delimited control and provides reasonable performance.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Benoit Desouter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desouter:Benoit", "Marko van Dooren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dooren:Marko_van", "Tom Schrijvers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schrijvers:Tom", "Alexander Vandenbroucke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vandenbroucke:Alexander"], "pages": 5}
