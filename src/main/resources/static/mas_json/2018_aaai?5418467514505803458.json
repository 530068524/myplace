{"title": "Streaming Non-Monotone Submodular Maximization: Personalized Video Summarization on the Fly.", "fields": ["knapsack problem", "automatic summarization", "streaming algorithm", "data stream mining", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "The need for real time analysis of rapidly producing data streams (e.g., video and image streams) motivated the design of streaming algorithms that can efficiently extract and summarize useful information from massive data \"on the fly\". Such problems can often be reduced to maximizing a submodular set function subject to various constraints. While efficient streaming methods have been recently developed for monotone submodular maximization, in a wide range of applications, such as video summarization, the underlying utility function is non-monotone, and there are often various constraints imposed on the optimization problem to consider privacy or personalization. We develop the first efficient single pass streaming algorithm, Streaming Local Search, with constant factor (4p-1)/4p(8p+2d-1) approximation guarantee for maximizing a non-monotone submodular function under a p-system and d knapsack constraints, with a memory independent of data size. In our experiments, we show that for the video summarization problem, our streaming method, while achieving practically the same performance, runs more than 1700 times faster than previous work.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Baharan Mirzasoleiman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirzasoleiman:Baharan", "Stefanie Jegelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jegelka:Stefanie", "Andreas Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause_0001:Andreas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
