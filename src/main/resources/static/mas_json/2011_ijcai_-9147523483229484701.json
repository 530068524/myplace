Abstraction is obtained by treating self-contained sub-systems called cones as single components. We then use a novel branch-and-bound search algorithm and compute the abstract minimum-cardinality diagnoses of the system, which are later refined hierarchically, in a careful manner, to get all minimum-cardinality diagnoses of the system. Experiments on ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits show that the new approach is faster than the previous state-of-the-art hierarchical approach, and scales to all circuits in the suite for the first time.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National University of Sciences and Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Sajjad Ahmed Siddiqi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siddiqi:Sajjad_Ahmed"], "pages": 6}
