{"title": "Querying Data Graphs with Arithmetical Regular Expressions.", "fields": ["logarithm", "alphabet", "regular expression", "formalism", "arithmetic function"], "abstract": "We propose a query language LARE for graphs whose edges are labelled by a finite alphabet and nodes store unbounded data values. LARE is based on a variant of regular expressions with memory. Queries of LARE can compare quantities of memorised graph nodes and their neighbourhoods. These features allow us to express a number of natural properties, while keeping the data complexity (with a query fixed) in non-deterministic logarithmic space. We establish an algorithm that works efficiently not only with LARE, but also with a wider language defined using effective relational conditions, another formalism we propose.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Maciej Grabon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grabon:Maciej", "Jakub Michaliszyn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michaliszyn:Jakub", "Jan Otop.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otop:Jan", "Piotr Wieczorek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wieczorek:Piotr"], "pages": 7}
