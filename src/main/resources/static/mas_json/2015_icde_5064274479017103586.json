Through investigations of customer scenarios at SAP we found that today's RDBMSs still leave a lot to be desired in order to meet the requirements of typical applications. Our research puts a new twist on handling hierarchies in SQL-based systems. We present an approach for modeling hierarchical data natively, and we extend the SQL language with expressive constructs for creating, manipulating, and querying a hierarchy. The constructs can be evaluated efficiently by leveraging existing indexing and query processing techniques. We demonstrate the feasibility of our concepts with initial measurements on a HANA-based prototype.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "SAP SE, Walldorf, Germany", "SAP SE, Walldorf, Germany"], "authors": ["Robert Brunel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brunel:Robert", "Jan Finis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finis:Jan", "Gerald Franz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Franz:Gerald", "Norman May.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/May:Norman", "Alfons Kemper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kemper:Alfons", "Thomas Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann_0001:Thomas", "Franz F\u00e4rber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/F=auml=rber:Franz"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
