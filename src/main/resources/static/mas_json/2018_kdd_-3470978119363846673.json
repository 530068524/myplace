In this paper, we propose a model-based short text stream clustering algorithm (MStream) which can deal with the concept drift problem and sparsity problem naturally. The MStream algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art performance with only one pass of the stream, and can have even better performance when we allow multiple iterations of each batch. We further propose an improved algorithm of MStream with forgetting rules called MStreamF, which can efficiently delete outdated documents by deleting clusters of outdated batches. Our extensive experimental study shows that MStream and MStreamF can achieve better performance than three baselines on several real datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "East China Normal University", "Shandong University"], "authors": ["Jianhua Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Jianhua", "Daren Chao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chao:Daren", "Zhongkun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhongkun", "Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0056:Wei", "Xiaohui Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Xiaohui", "Jianyong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jianyong"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
