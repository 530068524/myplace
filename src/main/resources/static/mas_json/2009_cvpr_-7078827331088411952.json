In particular, a class of tracking techniques called \u201ctracking by detection\u201d have been shown to give promising results at real-time speeds. These methods train a discriminative classifier in an online manner to separate the object from the background. This classifier bootstraps itself by using the current tracker state to extract positive and negative examples from the current frame. Slight inaccuracies in the tracker can therefore lead to incorrectly labeled training examples, which degrades the classifier and can cause further drift. In this paper we show that using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) instead of traditional supervised learning avoids these problems, and can therefore lead to a more robust tracker with fewer parameter tweaks. We present a novel online MIL algorithm for object tracking that achieves superior results with real-time performance.", "citation": "Citations (1,761)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, Merced", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Boris Babenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babenko:Boris", "Ming-Hsuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Ming=Hsuan", "Serge J.
