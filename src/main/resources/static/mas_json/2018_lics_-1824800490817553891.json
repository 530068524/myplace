{"title": "Impredicative Encodings of (Higher) Inductive Types.", "fields": ["intuitionistic type theory", "finitary", "homotopy type theory", "impredicativity", "dependent type"], "abstract": "Postulating an impredicative universe in dependent type theory allows System F style encodings of finitary inductive types, but these fail to satisfy the relevant \u03b7-equalities and consequently do not admit dependent eliminators. To recover \u03b7 and dependent elimination, we present a method to construct refinements of these impredicative encodings, using ideas from homotopy type theory. We then extend our method to construct impredicative encodings of some higher inductive types, such as 1-truncation and the unit circle S1.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Steve Awodey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Awodey:Steve", "Jonas Frey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frey:Jonas", "Sam Speight.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Speight:Sam"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
