{"title": "ReqsCov: A Tool for Measuring Test-Adequacy over Requirements.", "fields": ["software inspection", "test case", "modified condition decision coverage", "executable", "software metric"], "abstract": "When creating test cases for software, a common approach is to create tests that exercise requirements. Determining the adequacy of test cases, however, is generally done through inspection or indirectly by measuring structural coverage of an executable artifact (such as source code or a software model). We present ReqsCov, a tool to directly measure requirements coverage provided by test cases. ReqsCov allows users to measure Linear Temporal Logic requirements coverage using three increasingly rigorous requirements coverage metrics: naive coverage, antecedent coverage, and Unique First Cause coverage. By measuring requirements coverage, users are given insight into the quality of test suites beyond what is available when solely using structural coverage metrics over an implementation.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "NASA IV and V Facility"], "authors": ["Matt Staats.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Staats:Matt", "Weijia Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Weijia", "Ajitha Rajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajan:Ajitha", "Mats Per Erik Heimdahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heimdahl:Mats_Per_Erik", "Kurt Woodham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woodham:Kurt"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
