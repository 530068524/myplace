In this paper, we introduce ADMin, a low-cost IoT framework that reduces on device energy consumption and the volume of data disseminated across the network. This is achieved by efficiently adapting the rate at which IoT devices disseminate monitoring streams based on run-time knowledge of the stream evolution, variability and seasonal behavior. Rather than transmitting the entire stream, ADMin favors sending updates for its estimation model from which values can be inferred, triggering dissemination only when shifts in the stream evolution are detected. Results on real-life testbeds, show that ADMin is able to reduce energy consumption by at least 83%, data volume by 71%, shift detection delays by 61% while maintaining accuracy above 91% in comparison to other IoT frameworks.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Cyprus", "University of Cyprus", "University of Cyprus"], "authors": ["Demetris Trihinas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trihinas:Demetris", "George Pallis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pallis:George", "Marios D.
