{"title": "Improving Event Extraction via Multimodal Integration.", "fields": ["data set", "extractor", "multimodal therapy", "pattern recognition", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on improving Event Extraction (EE) by incorporating visual knowledge with words and phrases from text documents. We first discover visual patterns from large-scale text-image pairs in a weakly-supervised manner and then propose a multimodal event extraction algorithm where the event extractor is jointly trained with textual features and visual patterns. Extensive experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed multimodal EE method can achieve significantly better performance on event extraction: absolute 7.1% F-score gain on event trigger labeling and 8.5% F-score gain on event argument labeling.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Columbia University", "Microsoft", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Tongtao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tongtao", "Spencer Whitehead.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whitehead:Spencer", "Hanwang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hanwang", "Hongzhi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongzhi", "Joseph G.
