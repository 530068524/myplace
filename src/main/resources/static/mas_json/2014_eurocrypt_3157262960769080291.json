Key-versatile signatures allow us to sign with keys already in use for another purpose, without changing the keys and without impacting the security of the original purpose. This allows us to obtain advances across a collection of challenging domains including joint Enc/Sig, security against related-key attack (RKA) and security for key-dependent messages (KDM). Specically we can (1) Add signing capability to existing encryption capability with zero overhead in the size of the public key (2) Obtain RKA-secure signatures from any RKA-secure one-way function, yielding new RKA-secure signature schemes (3) Add integrity to encryption while maintaining KDM-security.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of Bristol", "Cryptography"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Sarah Meiklejohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meiklejohn:Sarah", "Susan Thomson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomson_0001:Susan"], "pages": 18}
