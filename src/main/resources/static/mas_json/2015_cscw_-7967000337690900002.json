{"title": "And Now for Something Completely Different: Improving Crowdsourcing Workflows with Micro-Diversions.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "user experience design", "retention rate", "human computer interaction", "workflow"], "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has become a popular and indispensable component of many problem-solving pipelines in the research literature, with crowd workers often treated as computational resources that can reliably solve problems that computers have trouble with, such as image labeling/classification, natural language processing, or document writing. Yet, obviously crowd workers are human, and long sequences of the same monotonous tasks might intuitively reduce the amount of good quality work done by the workers. Here we propose an investigation into how we can use diversions containing small amounts of entertainment to improve crowd workers' experiences. We call these small period of entertainment ``micro-diversions\", which we hypothesize to provide timely relief to workers during long sequences of micro-tasks. We hope to improve productivity by retaining workers to work on our tasks longer and to either improve or retain the quality of work. We experimentally test micro-diversions on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, a large paid-crowdsourcing platform. We find that micro-diversions can significantly improve worker retention rate while retaining the same work quality.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Google", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Peng Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Peng", "Jeffrey M.
