The operator of such networks is often required to maximize the available throughput while guaranteeing its restorability. This paper is the first to combine these seemingly conflicting goals into one optimization criterion: maximizing the restorable throughput of the end-to-end paths. We address this problem in three cases: when the operator has no knowledge of the future bandwidth demands, when it has partial knowledge, and when it has full knowledge. We present efficient algorithms for each of these cases and use extensive simulations to compare their performance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Reuven Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Reuven", "Gabi Nakibly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakibly:Gabi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
