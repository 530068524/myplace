They arise in the implementation of finger trees and other efficient functional data structures. We show how to reduce a large class of nonuniform datatypes and codatatypes to uniform types in higher-order logic. We programmed this reduction in the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant, thereby enriching its specification language. Moreover, we derive (co)induction and (co)recursion principles based on a weak variant of parametricity.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["VU University Amsterdam", "ETH Zurich", "Middlesex University", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Jasmin Christian Blanchette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanchette:Jasmin_Christian", "Fabian Meier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meier:Fabian", "Andrei Popescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popescu_0001:Andrei", "Dmitriy Traytel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traytel:Dmitriy"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
