This is the idea at the core of multi-task learning. In this context a fundamental question is how to incorporate the tasks structure in the learning problem. We tackle this question by studying a general computational framework that allows to encode apriori knowledge of the tasks structure in the form of a convex penalty; in this setting a variety of previously proposed methods can be recovered as special cases, including linear and non-linear approaches. Within this framework, we show that tasks and their structure can be efficiently learned considering a convex optimization problem that can be approached by means of block coordinate methods such as alternating minimization and for which we prove convergence to the global minimum.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Carlo Ciliberto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciliberto:Carlo", "Youssef Mroueh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mroueh:Youssef", "Tomaso A.
