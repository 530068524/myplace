{"title": "A Conditional Gradient Framework for Composite Convex Minimization with Applications to Semidefinite Programming.", "fields": ["multiplicative function", "semidefinite programming", "smoothing", "homotopy", "frank wolfe algorithm"], "abstract": "We propose a conditional gradient framework for a composite convex minimization template with broad applications. Our approach combines the notions of smoothing and homotopy under the CGM framework, and provably achieves the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{k})$ convergence rate. We demonstrate that the same rate holds if the linear subproblems are solved approximately with additive or multiplicative error. Specific applications of the framework include the non-smooth minimization, semidefinite programming, and minimization with linear inclusion constraints over a compact domain. We provide numerical evidence to demonstrate the benefits of the new framework.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "Max Planck Society", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Alp Yurtsever.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yurtsever:Alp", "Olivier Fercoq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fercoq:Olivier", "Francesco Locatello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Locatello:Francesco", "Volkan Cevher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cevher:Volkan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
