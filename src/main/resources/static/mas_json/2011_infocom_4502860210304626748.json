In this paper, we first introduce geometric quorum systems (along with their metrics) to incarnate the idea of in-network data storage. These quorum systems are \u201cgeometric\u201d because curves (rather than discrete node sets) are used to form quorums. We then propose GeoQuorum as a new quorum system, for which the quorum forming curves are parameterized. Our proposal significantly expands the quorum design methodology, by endowing a system with a great flexibility to fine-tune itself towards different application requirements. In particular, the tunability allows GeoQuorum to substantially improve the load balancing performance and to remain competitive in energy efficiency. Our simulation results confirm the performance enhancement brought by GeoQuorum.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Jun Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jun", "Ying He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Ying"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
