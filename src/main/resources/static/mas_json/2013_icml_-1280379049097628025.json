{"title": "A proximal Newton framework for composite minimization: Graph learning without Cholesky decompositions and matrix inversions.", "fields": ["composite number", "regularization", "minimum degree algorithm", "cholesky decomposition", "sparse matrix"], "abstract": "We propose an algorithmic framework for convex minimization problems of composite functions with two terms: a self-concordant part and a possibly nonsmooth regularization part. Our method is a new proximal Newton algorithm with local quadratic convergence rate. As a specific problem instance, we consider sparse precision matrix estimation problems in graph learning. Via a careful dual formulation and a novel analytic stepsize selection, we instantiate an algorithm within our framework for graph learning that avoids Cholesky decompositions and matrix inversions, making it attractive for parallel and distributed implementations.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Quoc Tran-Dinh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran=Dinh:Quoc", "Anastasios Kyrillidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kyrillidis:Anastasios", "Volkan Cevher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cevher:Volkan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
