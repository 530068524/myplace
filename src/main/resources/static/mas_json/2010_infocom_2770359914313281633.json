{"title": "Is Network Coding Always Good for Cooperative Communications?", "fields": ["mutual information", "transceiver", "linear network coding", "relay", "frame relay"], "abstract": "Network coding (NC) is a promising approach to reduce time-slot overhead for cooperative communications (CC) in a multi-session environment. Most of the existing works take advantage of the benefits of NC in CC but do not fully recognize its potential adverse effect. In this paper, we show that employing NC may not always benefit CC. We substantiate this important finding in the context of analog network coding (ANC) and amplify-and-forward (AF) CC. This paper, for the first time, introduces an important concept of network coding noise (NC noise). Specifically, we analyze the signal aggregation at a relay node and signal extraction at a destination node. We then use the analysis to derive a closed-form expression for NC noise at each destination node in a multi-session environment. We show that NC noise can diminish the advantage of NC in CC. Our results formalizes an important concept on using NC in CC.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "United States Naval Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Sushant Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Sushant", "Yi Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi_0001:Yi", "Jia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Jia", "Y.
