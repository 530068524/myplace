Taking a network calculus approach, we consider both deterministic and statistical performance metrics. A key enabling contribution for our analysis is a significantly sharpened method for computing a statistical bound for the service given to a flow by the network as a whole. For a suitably parsimonious traffic model we develop closed-form expressions for end-to-end delays, backlog, and output burstiness. The deterministic versions of our bounds yield optimal bounds on end-to-end backlog and output burstiness for some schedulers, and are highly accurate for end-to-end delay bounds.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Yashar Ghiassi-Farrokhfal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghiassi=Farrokhfal:Yashar", "J\u00f6rg Liebeherr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liebeherr:J=ouml=rg", "Almut Burchard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burchard:Almut"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
