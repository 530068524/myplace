We prove that any set of n points in d dimensions (rows in a matrix A \u2208 \u211dn x d) can be projected into t = \u03a9(k/e2) dimensions, for any e \u2208 (0, 1/3), in O(nd[e-2k/ log(d)]) time, such that with constant probability the optimal k-partition of the point set is preserved within a factor of 2 + e. The projection is done by post-multiplying A with a d x t random matrix R having entries + 1/\u221at or -1/\u221at with equal probability. A numerical implementation of our technique and experiments on a large face images dataset verify the speed and the accuracy of our theoretical results.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Department of C ... r Science, RPI", "Department of C ... r Science, RPI"], "authors": ["Christos Boutsidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boutsidis:Christos", "Anastasios Zouzias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zouzias:Anastasios", "Petros Drineas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drineas:Petros"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
