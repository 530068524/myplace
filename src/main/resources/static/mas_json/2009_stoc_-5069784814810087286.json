Specifically, given an undirected graph embedded on an orientable surface of genus g, with two specified vertices s and t, we can compute a maximum (s,t)-flow in O(g 7  n log 2  n log 2  C) time for integer capacities that sum to C, or in (g log n) O(g)  n time for real capacities. Except for the special case of planar graphs, for which an O(n log n)-time algorithm has been known for 20 years, the best previous time bounds for maximum flows in surface-embedded graphs follow from algorithms for general sparse graphs. Our key insight is to optimize the relative homology class of the flow, rather than directly optimizing the flow itself. A dual formulation of our algorithm computes the minimum-cost cycle or circulation in a given (real or integer) homology class.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Saint Louis University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Saint Louis University", "Saint Louis University"], "authors": ["Erin W.
