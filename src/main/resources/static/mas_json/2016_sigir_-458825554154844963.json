{"title": "A Visual Analytics Approach for What-If Analysis of Information Retrieval Systems.", "fields": ["analytics", "data mining", "visual analytics", "computer science", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "We present the innovative visual analytics approach of the VATE system, which eases and makes more effective the experimental evaluation process by introducing the what-if analysis. The what-if analysis is aimed at estimating the possible effects of a modification to an IR system to select the most promising fixes before implementing them, thus saving a considerable amount of effort. VATE builds on an analytical framework which models the behavior of the systems in order to make estimations, and integrates this analytical framework into a visual part which, via proper interaction and animations, receives input and provides feedback to the user.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "University of Padua", "Sapienza University of Rome", "University of Padua"], "authors": ["Marco Angelini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angelini:Marco", "Nicola Ferro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferro:Nicola", "Giuseppe Santucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santucci:Giuseppe", "Gianmaria Silvello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silvello:Gianmaria"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
