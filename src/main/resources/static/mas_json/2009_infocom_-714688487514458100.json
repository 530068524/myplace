The st rong requirement to support real-time applications in these set tings leads us to consider TDMA link scheduling. Such schedu ling takes on a different flavour in long-distance mesh networks d ue to the unique spatial reuse pattern. In this paper, we cons ider the FRACTEL architecture for long-distance mesh networks. We propose and substantiate a novel angular interference mo del. This model is not only practical, but also makes the problem o TDMA scheduling tractable. We then make two significant algorithmic contributions. (1) We first present a simple, 3/ 2 approximate algorithm for TDMA scheduling. (2) We then consider delay-bounded scheduling and present an algorith m which uses at most 1/3rd more time-slots than the optimal number of slots required without the delay bound. Our evalua tion on random as well as real network topologies shows that the algorithms are practical, and are more efficient in pract ice than their worst-case bounds.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "authors": ["Debmalya Panigrahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panigrahi:Debmalya", "Bhaskaran Raman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raman:Bhaskaran"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
