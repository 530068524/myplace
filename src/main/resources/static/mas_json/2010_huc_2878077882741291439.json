{"title": "Let's play!: mobile health games for adults.", "fields": ["adult learning", "analytical skill", "behavior change", "transtheoretical model", "casual"], "abstract": "Researchers have designed a variety of systems that promote wellness. However, little work has been done to examine how casual mobile games can help adults learn how to live healthfully. To explore this design space, we created  OrderUP! , a game in which players learn how to make healthier meal choices. Through our field study, we found that playing OrderUP! helped participants engage in four  processes of change  identified by a well-established health behavior theory, the Transtheoretical Model: they improved their understanding of how to eat healthfully and engaged in nutrition-related analytical thinking, reevaluated the healthiness of their real life habits, formed helping relationships by discussing nutrition with others and started replacing unhealthy meals with more nutritious foods. Our research shows the promise of using casual mobile games to encourage adults to live healthier lifestyles.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Andrea Grimes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grimes:Andrea", "Vasudhara Kantroo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kantroo:Vasudhara", "Rebecca E.
