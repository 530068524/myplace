{"title": "Content Security Problems?: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Content Security Policy in the Wild.", "fields": ["content security policy", "software deployment", "network security policy", "security policy", "vulnerability"], "abstract": "Content Security Policy (CSP) is an emerging W3C standard introduced to mitigate the impact of content injection vulnerabilities on websites. We perform a systematic, large-scale analysis of four key aspects that impact on the effectiveness of CSP: browser support, website adoption, correct configuration and constant maintenance. While browser support is largely satisfactory, with the exception of few notable issues, our analysis unveils several shortcomings relative to the other three aspects. CSP appears to have a rather limited deployment as yet and, more crucially, existing policies exhibit a number of weaknesses and misconfiguration errors. Moreover, content security policies are not regularly updated to ban insecure practices and remove unintended security violations. We argue that many of these problems can be fixed by better exploiting the monitoring facilities of CSP, while other issues deserve additional research, being more rooted into the CSP design.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Ca' Foscari University of Venice", "Ca' Foscari University of Venice", "Ca' Foscari University of Venice"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Stefano Calzavara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calzavara:Stefano", "Alvise Rabitti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabitti:Alvise", "Michele Bugliesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bugliesi:Michele"], "pages": 11}
