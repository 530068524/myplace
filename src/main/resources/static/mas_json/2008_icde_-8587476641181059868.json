{"title": "A Motion-Aware Approach to Continuous Retrieval of 3D Objects.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "latency", "mobile computing", "mobile device", "mobile search"], "abstract": "With recent advances in mobile computing technologies, mobile devices can now render 3D objects realistically. Many users of these devices such as tourists, mixed-reality gamers, and rescue officers, need real-time retrieval of 3D objects over a wireless network. Due to bandwidth and latency restrictions in mobile settings, efficient continuous retrieval of 3D objects remains a challenge. In this paper, we describe a motion-aware approach to this problem. We first introduce multi-resolution storage and retrieval methods for 3D data, which restrict access to only the necessary content based on the client's motion pattern. We then propose a motion-aware buffer management technique as well as an efficient index using multi-resolution representations of objects. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution to continuous retrieval of complex spatial data in mobile settings.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Mohammed Eunus Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Mohammed_Eunus", "Rui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Rui", "Egemen Tanin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanin:Egemen", "Lars Kulik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulik:Lars"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
