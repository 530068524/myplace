{"title": "Towards a program logic for JavaScript.", "fields": ["unobtrusive javascript", "static program analysis", "javascript", "separation logic", "soundness"], "abstract": "JavaScript has become the most widely used language for client-side web programming. The dynamic nature of JavaScript makes understanding its code notoriously difficult, leading to buggy programs and a lack of adequate static-analysis tools. We believe that logical reasoning has much to offer JavaScript: a simple description of program behaviour, a clear understanding of module boundaries, and the ability to verify security contracts. We introduce a program logic for reasoning about a broad subset of JavaScript, including challenging features such as prototype inheritance and \"with\". We adapt ideas from separation logic to provide tractable reasoning about JavaScript code: reasoning about easy programs is easy; reasoning about hard programs is possible. We prove a strong soundness result. All libraries written in our subset and proved correct with respect to their specifications will be well-behaved, even when called by arbitrary JavaScript code.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Philippa Gardner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gardner:Philippa", "Sergio Maffeis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maffeis:Sergio", "Gareth David Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Gareth_David"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2012", "pages": 14}
