Different metrics (e.g. BLEU, TER) focus on different aspects of translation quality; our multi-objective approach leverages these diverse aspects to improve overall quality.\n\nOur approach is based on the theory of Pareto Optimality. It is simple to implement on top of existing single-objective optimization methods (e.g. MERT, PRO) and outperforms ad hoc alternatives based on linear-combination of metrics. We also discuss the issue of metric tunability and show that our Pareto approach is more effective in incorporating new metrics from MT evaluation for MT optimization.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["NTT Communicati ... , Kyoto, Japan", "NTT Communicati ... , Kyoto, Japan", "NTT Communicati ... , Kyoto, Japan", "NTT Communicati ... , Kyoto, Japan", "NTT Communicati ... , Kyoto, Japan"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kevin Duh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duh:Kevin", "Katsuhito Sudoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sudoh:Katsuhito", "Xianchao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xianchao", "Hajime Tsukada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsukada:Hajime", "Masaaki Nagata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagata:Masaaki"], "pages": 10}
