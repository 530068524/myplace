Previous work, most notably m-invariance, has made considerable progress in devising a scheme that attempts to prevent individual records from being associated with too few sensitive values. We show, however, that in the presence of updates, even an m-invariant table can be exploited by a new type of attack we call the \u201cequivalence-attack.\u201d To deal with the equivalence attack, we propose a graph-based anonymization algorithm that leverages solutions to the classic \u201cmin-cut/max-flow\u201d problem, and demonstrate with experiments that our algorithm is efficient and effective in preventing equivalence attacks.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Yeye He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yeye", "Siddharth Barman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barman:Siddharth", "Jeffrey F.
