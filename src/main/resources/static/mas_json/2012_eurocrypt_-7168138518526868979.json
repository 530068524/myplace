This is similar to Cramer-Shoup projective hashing, except that instead of smoothness, which stipulates that the output of the hash function looks random on no instances, we require invertibility, which stipulates that the output of the hash function on no instances uniquely determine the hashing key, and moreover, that there is a trapdoor which allows us to efficiently recover the hashing key.\n\n\u2014 We show a simple construction of lossy trapdoor functions via dual projective hashing. Our construction encompasses almost all known constructions of lossy trapdoor functions, as given in the works of Peikert and Waters (STOC '08) and Freeman et al. (PKC '10).\n\n\u2014 We also provide a simple construction of deterministic encryption schemes secure with respect to hard-to-invert auxiliary input, under an additional assumption about the projection map. Our construction clarifies and encompasses all of the constructions given in the recent work of Brakerski and Segev (Crypto '11). In addition, we obtain a new deterministic encryption scheme based on LWE.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["George Washington University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Hoeteck Wee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wee:Hoeteck"], "pages": 17}
