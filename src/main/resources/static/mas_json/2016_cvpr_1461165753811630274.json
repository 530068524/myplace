Here, we consider information gain as the utility function. While these concepts are often used to reason about 3D sensors, these are usually treated as a predefined black-box component. In this paper, we show how the same principles can be used as part of the 3D sensor. We describe the generative model for structured-light 3D scanning and show how adaptive pattern selection can maximize information gain in an open-loop-feedback manner. We then demonstrate how different choices of relevant variable sets (corresponding to the subproblems of localization and mapping) lead to different criteria for pattern selection and can be computed in an online fashion. We show results for both subproblems with several pattern dictionary choices and demonstrate their usefulness for pose estimation and depth acquisition.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Guy Rosman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosman:Guy", "Daniela Rus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rus:Daniela", "John W.
