{"title": "Rethinking eventual consistency.", "fields": ["eventual consistency", "database", "distributed computing", "distributed database", "data mining"], "abstract": "There has been a resurgence of work on replicated, distributed database systems to meet the demands of intermittently-connected clients and of disaster-tolerant databases that span data centers. Many systems weaken the criteria for replica-consistency or isolation, and in some cases add new mechanisms, to improve partition-tolerance, availability, and performance. We present a framework for comparing these criteria and mechanisms, to help architects navigate through this complex design space.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Philip A.
