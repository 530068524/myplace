{"title": "Cumulon: optimizing statistical data analysis in the cloud.", "fields": ["execution model", "computational statistics", "software deployment", "data parallelism", "provisioning"], "abstract": "We present Cumulon, a system designed to help users rapidly develop and intelligently deploy matrix-based big-data analysis programs in the cloud. Cumulon features a flexible execution model and new operators especially suited for such workloads. We show how to implement Cumulon on top of Hadoop/HDFS while avoiding limitations of MapReduce, and demonstrate Cumulon's performance advantages over existing Hadoop-based systems for statistical data analysis. To support intelligent deployment in the cloud according to time/budget constraints, Cumulon goes beyond database-style optimization to make choices automatically on not only physical operators and their parameters, but also hardware provisioning and configuration settings. We apply a suite of benchmarking, simulation, modeling, and search techniques to support effective cost-based optimization over this rich space of deployment plans.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Botong Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Botong", "Shivnath Babu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babu:Shivnath", "Jun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Jun"], "pages": 12}
