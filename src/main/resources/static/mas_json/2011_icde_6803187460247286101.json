A significant challenge in similarity join is to implement an effective fuzzy match operation to find all similar string pairs which may not match exactly. In this paper, we propose a new similarity metrics, called \u201cfuzzy token matching based similarity\u201d, which extends token-based similarity functions (e.g., Jaccard similarity and Cosine similarity) by allowing fuzzy match between two tokens. We study the problem of similarity join using this new similarity metrics and present a signature-based method to address this problem. We propose new signature schemes and develop effective pruning techniques to improve the performance. Experimental results show that our approach achieves high efficiency and result quality, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (103)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jiannan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jiannan", "Guoliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Guoliang", "Jianhua Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jianhua"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
