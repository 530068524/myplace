{"title": "Forsaking inheritance: supercharged delegation in DelphJ.", "fields": ["delegation", "object composition", "late binding", "metaprogramming", "morphing"], "abstract": "We propose DelphJ: a Java-based OO language that eschews inheritance completely, in favor of a combination of class morphing and (deep) delegation. Compared to past delegation approaches, the novel aspect of our design is the ability to emulate the best aspects of inheritance while retaining maximum flexibility: using morphing, a class can select any of the methods of its delegatee and export them (if desired) or transform them (e.g., to add extra arguments or modify type signatures), yet without needing to name these methods explicitly and handle them one-by-one. Compared to past work on morphing, our approach adopts and adapts advanced delegation mechanisms, in order to add late binding capabilities and, thus, provide a full substitute of inheritance. Additionally, we explore complex semantic issues in the interaction of delegation with late binding. We present our language design both informally, with numerous examples, and formally in a core calculus.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National and Kapodistrian University of Athens", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"], "authors": ["Prodromos Gerakios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerakios:Prodromos", "Aggelos Biboudis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biboudis:Aggelos", "Yannis Smaragdakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smaragdakis:Yannis"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2013", "pages": 20}
