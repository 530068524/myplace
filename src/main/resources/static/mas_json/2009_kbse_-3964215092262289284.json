{"title": "Service Substitution Revisited.", "fields": ["scaling", "xml", "computational complexity theory", "web service", "software"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a framework that reduces the complexity of service substitution. The framework is based on two substitution relations and corresponding theorems. The proposed relations and theorems allow organizing available services into groups. Then, the complexity of retrieving candidate substitute services for the target service and generating corresponding adapters scales up with the number of available groups, instead of scaling up with the number of available services.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Ioannina", "University of Ioannina", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Dionysis Athanasopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Athanasopoulos:Dionysis", "Apostolos V.
