We propose TF-label, an efficient and scalable labeling scheme for processing reachability queries. TF-label is constructed based on a novel topological folding (TF) that recursively folds an input graph into half so as to reduce the label size, thus improving query efficiency. We show that TF-label is efficient to construct and propose efficient algorithms and optimization schemes. Our experiments verify that TF-label is significantly more scalable and efficient than the state-of-the-art methods in both index construction and query processing.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James", "Silu Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Silu", "Huanhuan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Huanhuan", "Ada Wai-Chee Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Ada_Wai=Chee"], "pages": 12}
