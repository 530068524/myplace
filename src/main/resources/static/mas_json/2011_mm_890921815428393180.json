The comparison of two descriptors relies on an vector-to-binary code comparison, which limits the quantization error associated with the query compared with the original Hamming Embedding method. The approach is used in combination with an inverted file structure that offers high efficiency, comparable to that of a regular bag-of-features retrieval system. The comparison is performed on two popular datasets. Our method consistently improves the search quality over the symmetric version. The trade-off between memory usage and precision is evaluated, showing that the method is especially useful for short binary signatures.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Mihir Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Mihir", "Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=eacute=gou:Herv=eacute=", "Patrick Gros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gros:Patrick"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
