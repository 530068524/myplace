MiningZinc consists of two key components: a language component and a toolchain component.\n\nThe language allows for high-level and natural modeling of mining problems, such that MiningZinc models closely resemble definitions found in the data mining literature. It is inspired by the Zinc family of languages and systems and supports user-defined constraints and optimization criteria.\n\nThe toolchain allows for finding solutions to the models. It ensures the solver independence of the language and supports both standard constraint solvers and specialized data mining systems. Automatic model transformations enable the efficient use of different solvers and systems.\n\nThe combination of both components allows one to rapidly model constraint-based mining problems and execute these with a wide variety of methods. We demonstrate this experimentally for a number of well-known solvers and data mining tasks.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Monash University", "Leiden University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Tias Guns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guns:Tias", "Anton Dries.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dries:Anton", "Guido Tack.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tack:Guido", "Siegfried Nijssen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nijssen:Siegfried", "Luc De Raedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raedt:Luc_De"], "pages": 8}
