An effective portal web search engine must support a variety of search needs, including realtime web search. However, supporting realtime web search introduces two challenges not encountered in non-realtime web search: quickly crawling relevant content and ranking documents with impoverished link and click information. In this paper, we advocate the use of realtime micro-blogging data for addressing both of these problems. We propose a method to use the micro-blogging data stream to detect fresh URLs. We also use micro-blogging data to compute novel and effective features for ranking fresh URLs. We demonstrate these methods improve effective of the portal web search engine for realtime web search.", "citation": "Citations (226)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Anlei Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Anlei", "Ruiqiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ruiqiang", "Pranam Kolari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolari:Pranam", "Jing Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Jing", "Fernando Diaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diaz_0001:Fernando", "Yi Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi", "Zhaohui Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Zhaohui", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
