It increases the scale of MVU embeddings by several orders of magnitude and is naturally parallel. This unprecedented scalability opens up new avenues of applications for manifold learning, in particular the use of MVU embeddings as effective heuristics to speed-up A* search. We demonstrate unmatched reductions in search time across several non-trivial A* benchmark search problems and bridge the gap between the manifold learning literature and one of its most promising high impact applications.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Wenlin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wenlin", "Kilian Q.
