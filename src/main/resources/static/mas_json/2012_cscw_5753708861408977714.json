We draw from the literatures of science studies and e-science practices to advance a document-centered articulation of social scientists' distributed work practices. We report on a pilot study to provide some insights into CI needs for these scholars. This study relied on a mixed-methodological approach involving the mapping of digital and physical documents, automated tracking of desktop and online repositories, participant-generated images of physical documents and desktop, behavioral queries, along with interviews and participant observation. Findings suggest a document perspective provides insight into the distributed work practices and CI uses of social scientists.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Syracuse University", "Syracuse University", "Syracuse University"], "authors": ["Steve Sawyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sawyer:Steve", "Elizabeth Kaziunas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaziunas:Elizabeth", "Carsten S. \u00d8sterlund.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Oslash=sterlund:Carsten_S="], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
