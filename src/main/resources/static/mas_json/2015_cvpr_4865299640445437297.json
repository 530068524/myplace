Considering that features from different channels could share some similar hidden structures, we propose a joint learning model to simultaneously explore the shared and feature-specific components as an instance of heterogenous multi-task learning. The proposed model in an unified framework is capable of: 1) jointly mining a set of subspaces with the same dimensionality to enable the multi-task classifier learning, and 2) meanwhile, quantifying the shared and feature-specific components of features in the subspaces. To efficiently train the joint model, a three-step iterative optimization algorithm is proposed, followed by two inference models. Extensive results on three activity datasets have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method. In addition, a novel RGB-D activity dataset focusing on human-object interaction is collected for evaluating the proposed method, which will be made available to the community for RGB-D activity benchmarking and analysis.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "University of Dundee", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "University of Dundee"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jianfang Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Jianfang", "Wei-Shi Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Wei=Shi", "Jian-Huang Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Jian=Huang", "Jianguo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jianguo"], "pages": 9}
