{"title": "Compatible-Based Conditioning in Interval-Based Possibilistic Logic.", "fields": ["operator", "syntax", "compatibility", "computation", "conditioning"], "abstract": "Interval-based possibilistic logic is a flexible setting extending standard possibilistic logic such that each logical expression is associated with a sub-interval of [0, 1]. This paper focuses on the fundamental issue of conditioning in the interval-based possibilistic setting. The first part of the paper first proposes a set of natural properties that an interval-based conditioning operator should satisfy. We then give a natural and safe definition for conditioning an interval-based possibility distribution. This definition is based on applying standard min-based or product-based conditioning on the set of all associated compatible possibility distributions. We analyze the obtained posterior distributions and provide a precise characterization of lower and upper endpoints of the intervals associated with interpretations. The second part of the paper provides an equivalent syntactic computation of interval-based conditioning when interval-based distributions are compactly encoded by means of interval-based possibilistic knowledge bases. We show that interval-based conditioning is achieved without extra computational cost comparing to conditioning standard possibilistic knowledge bases.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["university of lille", "university of lille", "university of lille", "University of Texas at El Paso"], "authors": ["Salem Benferhat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benferhat:Salem", "Am\u00e9lie Levray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levray:Am=eacute=lie", "Karim Tabia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tabia:Karim", "Vladik Kreinovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kreinovich:Vladik"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
