{"title": "Neural Models for Documents with Metadata.", "fields": ["perplexity", "text corpus", "metadata", "topic model", "personalization"], "abstract": "Most real-world document collections involve various types of metadata, such as author, source, and date, and yet the most commonly-used approaches to modeling text corpora ignore this information. While specialized models have been developed for particular applications, few are widely used in practice, as customization typically requires derivation of a custom inference algorithm. In this paper, we build on recent advances in variational inference methods and propose a general neural framework, based on topic models, to enable flexible incorporation of metadata and allow for rapid exploration of alternative models. Our approach achieves strong performance, with a manageable tradeoff between perplexity, coherence, and sparsity. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our framework through an exploration of a corpus of articles about US immigration.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Noah A.
