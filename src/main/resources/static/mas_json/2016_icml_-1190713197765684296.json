{"title": "Correlation Clustering and Biclustering with Locally Bounded Errors.", "fields": ["complete graph", "correlation clustering", "vertex", "rounding", "biclustering", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We consider a generalized version of the correlation clustering problem, defined as follows. Given a complete graph    $G$    whose edges are labeled with + or \u2212, we wish to partition the graph into clusters while trying to avoid errors: + edges between clusters or \u2212 edges within clusters. Classically, one seeks to minimize the total number of such errors. We introduce a new framework that allows the objective to be a more general function of the number of errors at each vertex (for example, we may wish to minimize the number of errors at the  worst  vertex) and provides a rounding algorithm which converts \u201cfractional clusterings\u201d into discrete clusterings while causing only a constant-factor blowup in the number of errors at each vertex. This rounding algorithm yields constant-factor approximation algorithms for the discrete problem under a wide variety of objective functions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Gregory J.
