However, due to the intricate structural divergence between natural languages, unidirectional attention-based models might only capture partial aspects of attentional regularities. We propose agreement-based joint training for bidirectional attention-based end-to-end neural machine translation. Instead of training source-to-target and target-to-source translation models independently, our approach encourages the two complementary models to agree on word alignment matrices on the same training data. Experiments on Chinese-English and English-French translation tasks show that agreement-based joint training significantly improves both alignment and translation quality over independent training.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Baidu", "Baidu", "Baidu"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Yong", "Shiqi Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Shiqi", "Zhongjun He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Zhongjun", "Wei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Wei", "Hua Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0003:Hua", "Maosong Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Maosong", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Yang"], "pages": 7}
