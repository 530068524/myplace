We use Gentry\u2019s technique to construct a fully homomorphic scheme from a \u201cbootstrappable\u201d somewhat homomorphic scheme. However, instead of using ideal lattices over a polynomial ring, our bootstrappable encryption scheme merely uses addition and multiplication over the integers. The main appeal of our scheme is the conceptual simplicity.\n\nWe reduce the security of our scheme to finding an approximate integer gcd \u2013 i.e., given a list of integers that are near-multiples of a hidden integer, output that hidden integer. We investigate the hardness of this task, building on earlier work of Howgrave-Graham.", "citation": "Citations (1,432)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Marten van Dijk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dijk:Marten_van", "Craig Gentry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentry:Craig", "Shai Halevi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halevi:Shai", "Vinod Vaikuntanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaikuntanathan:Vinod"], "pages": 20}
