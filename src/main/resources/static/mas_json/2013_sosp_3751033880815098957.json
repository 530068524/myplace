{"title": "ROOT: replaying multithreaded traces with resource-oriented ordering.", "fields": ["service level agreement", "cloud computing", "nondeterministic algorithm", "parallel computing", "real time computing"], "abstract": "We describe ROOT, a new method for incorporating the nondeterministic I/O behavior of multithreaded applications into trace replay. ROOT is the application of  R esource- O riented  O rdering to  T race replay: actions involving a common resource are replayed in an order similar to that of the original trace. ROOT is based on the idea that how a program manages resources, as seen in a trace, provides hints about an application's internal dependencies. Inferring these dependencies allows us to partially constrain trace replay in a way that reflects the constraints of the original program. We make three contributions: (1) we describe the ROOT approach, (2) we release ARTC, a new ROOT-based tool for replaying I/O traces, and (3) we create Magritte, a file-system benchmark suite generated by applying ARTC to 34 Apple desktop application traces. When collecting traces on one platform and replaying on another, ARTC achieves an average timing inaccuracy of 10.6% on our benchmark workloads, halving the 21.3% achieved by the next-best replay method we evaluate.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Zev Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:Zev", "Tyler Harter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harter:Tyler", "Andrea C.
