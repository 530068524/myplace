{"title": "CR Uchu-senkan Yamato 2.", "fields": ["liquid crystal display", "multimedia", "computer graphics images", "exhibition", "computer science"], "abstract": "This work is a 3D CG remake of a 1970s animated TV series, \"Uchu-senkan Yamato\", using its famous theme song as the soundtrack. It is comprised of numerous scenes well known to its original viewers. This 90-second video is unique because it is exhibited on an LCD display inside the Japanese gaming machine Pachinko when the player achieves a high score. By creating almost every cut in 3D CG, we enabled both an HD version and a 3D version, which is intended for exhibition at events.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Omnibus Japan Inc., Japan"], "authors": ["Akio Ohara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohara:Akio"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
