{"title": "Understanding the Role Fluidity of Stakeholders During Assistive Technology Research \"In the Wild\".", "fields": ["project stakeholder", "collaboration", "software deployment", "social group", "data analysis"], "abstract": "Deploying novel technologies requires the coordinated efforts of the research team, research participants, and a variety of community members and project stakeholders. To ensure that the project is completed successfully, these disparate groups of people engage in articulation work, which is the meta-work that supports the use of collaborative systems. In this paper, we examine the articulation work surrounding the deployment of systems that have found limited long-term adoption: assistive technology. Specifically, we examine three research deployments of a collaborative game for children with autism. Analysis of the articulation work performed during these studies demonstrates how research deployments of technologies create conditions in which stakeholders must take on additional roles to make the deployment work. By understanding the articulation work surrounding deployment studies engendered in this role fluidity, we can improve both research design and the analysis of data emergent from these studies.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of Iowa", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["LouAnne E.
