{"title": "Lifted Inference Rules With Constraints.", "fields": ["rule of inference", "exploit", "binomial", "homogeneous space", "inference"], "abstract": "Lifted inference rules exploit symmetries for fast reasoning in statistical relational models. Computational complexity of these rules is highly dependent on the choice of the constraint language they operate on and therefore coming up with the right kind of representation is critical to the success of lifted inference. In this paper, we propose a new constraint language, called setineq, which allows subset, equality and inequality constraints, to represent substitutions over the variables in the theory. Our constraint formulation is strictly more expressive than existing representations, yet easy to operate on. We reformulate the three main lifting rules: decomposer, generalized binomial and the recently proposed single occurrence for MAP inference, to work with our constraint representation. Experiments on benchmark MLNs for exact and sampling based inference demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several other existing techniques.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "Dept. of Comp.  ... w Delhi, India", "Dept. of Comp.  ... w Delhi, India", "Dept. of Comp.  ... w Delhi, India"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Happy Mittal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mittal:Happy", "Anuj Mahajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahajan:Anuj", "Vibhav Gogate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gogate:Vibhav", "Parag Singla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singla:Parag"], "pages": 9}
