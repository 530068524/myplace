{"title": "Being in the thick of in-the-wild studies: the challenges and insights of researcher participation.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "participant observation", "empathy", "computer science", "ethnography"], "abstract": "We describe the insights and challenges offered by researcher participation in in-the-wild studies through the comparison of two prototype evaluations with varying levels of researcher participation. By reflecting on these studies we expose different facets of the researcher's role when interacting with participants in in-the-wild studies. We also demonstrate the value of researcher participation in contributing to the way a researcher understands participant responses: aiding rapport, promoting empathy and stimulating the researcher to reflect on their own assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "Open University", "University College London"], "authors": ["Rose M.
