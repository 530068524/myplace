Our method unifies many existing approaches to collapsed variational inference. Our collapsed variational inference leads to a new lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We exploit the information geometry of the bound to derive much faster optimization methods based on conjugate gradients for these models. Our approach is very general and is easily applied to any model where the mean field update equations have been derived. Empirically we show significant speed-ups for probabilistic inference using our bound.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "University of Manchester", "University of Sheffield"], "authors": ["James Hensman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hensman:James", "Magnus Rattray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rattray:Magnus", "Neil D.
