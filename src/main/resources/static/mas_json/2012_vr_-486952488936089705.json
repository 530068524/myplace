Except for the six-sided CAVE systems, the missing back wall(s) of a CAVE system can be a confounding factor when virtual and physical navigation interaction techniques are compared, regarding the viewpoint rotation. We introduce a virtual black wall as a way to avoid a possible confounding factor in comparative studies. Based on our pilot study, we found that the virtual black wall can provide the comparable experimental condition for the two types of navigation interaction techniques and that the wall can play a dual role as an obstacle and a landmark during navigation. These findings provide a stepping stone for further investigation of the virtual black wall.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Ji-Sun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Ji=Sun", "Denis Gracanin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gracanin:Denis"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
