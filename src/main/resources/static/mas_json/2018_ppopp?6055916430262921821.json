As they cede their data to the cloud provider, they may cede data confidentiality. We develop SecureMR, a system that analyzes and transforms MapReduce programs to operate over encrypted data. SecureMR makes use of partially homomorphic encryption and a trusted client. We evaluate SecureMR on a set of MapReduce benchmarks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "IBM"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Yao Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Yao", "Ana Milanova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milanova:Ana", "Julian Dolby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dolby:Julian"], "pages": 2}
