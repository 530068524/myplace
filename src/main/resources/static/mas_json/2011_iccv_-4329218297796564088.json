They can exploit the long term motion difference between objects, but they tend to be sparse due to computational reasons and the difficulty in estimating motion in homogeneous areas. In this paper we introduce a variational method to obtain dense segmentations from such sparse trajectory clusters. Information is propagated with a hierarchical, nonlinear diffusion process that runs in the continuous domain but takes superpixels into account. We show that this process raises the density from 3% to 100% and even increases the average precision of labels.", "citation": "Citations (171)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Peter Ochs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ochs:Peter", "Thomas Brox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brox:Thomas"], "pages": 8}
