Its challenging problems are large intra-class variations, and tremendous time and space complexity. In this paper, we develop a new deep convolutional neural network (deep CNN) to learn discriminative and compact binary representations of faces for face video retrieval. The network integrates feature extraction and hash learning into a unified optimization framework for the optimal compatibility of feature extractor and hash functions. In order to better initialize the network, the low-rank discriminative binary hashing is proposed to pre-learn hash functions during the training procedure. Our method achieves excellent performances on two challenging TV-Series datasets.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Stony Brook University", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Beijing Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Zhen Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Zhen", "Su Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Su", "Tianfu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Tianfu", "Mingtao Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Mingtao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
