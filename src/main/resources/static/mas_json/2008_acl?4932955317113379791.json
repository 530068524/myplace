In question search, given a question as query, we are to return questions semantically equivalent or close to the queried question. In this paper, we propose to conduct question search by identifying question topic and question focus. More specifically, we first summarize questions in a data structure consisting of question topic and question focus. Then we model question topic and question focus in a language modeling framework for search. We also propose to use the MDLbased tree cut model for identifying question topic and question focus automatically. Experimental results indicate that our approach of identifying question topic and question focus for search significantly outperforms the baseline methods such as Vector Space Model (VSM) and Language Model for Information Retrieval (LMIR).", "citation": "Citations (149)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Huizhong Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Huizhong", "Yunbo Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yunbo", "Chin-Yew Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chin=Yew", "Yong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yong"], "pages": 9}
