The key idea of our generalization is to characterize a network (graph) by a bivariate distribution that specifies the probability of the two vertices appearing at both ends of a randomly selected path in the graph. With such a bivariate distribution, we give a probabilistic definition of a community and a definition of a modularity index. To detect communities in a network, we propose a class of distribution-based clustering algorithms that have comparable computational complexity to that of Newman's fast algorithm. Our generalization provides the additional freedom to choose a bivariate distribution and a correlation measure. As such, we obtain significant performance improvement over the original Newman fast algorithm in the computer simulations of random graphs with known community structure.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University"], "authors": ["Cheng-Shang Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Cheng=Shang", "Chin-Yi Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Chin=Yi", "Jay Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Jay", "Duan-Shin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Duan=Shin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
