{"title": "A Taxonomy of Queries for E-commerce Search.", "fields": ["product topology", "information retrieval", "e commerce", "empirical research", "search engine"], "abstract": "Understanding the search tasks and search behavior of users is necessary for optimizing search engine results. While much work has been done on understanding the users in Web search, little knowledge is available about the search tasks and behavior of users in the E-Commerce (E-Com) search applications. In this paper, we share the first empirical study of the queries and search behavior of users in E-Com search by analyzing search log from a major E-Com search engine. The analysis results show that E-Com queries can be categorized into five categories, each with distinctive search behaviors: (1) Shallow Exploration Queries are short vague queries that a user may use initially in exploring the product space. (2) Targeted Purchase Queries are queries used by users to purchase items that they are generally familiar with, thus without much decision making. (3) Major-Item Shopping Queries are used by users to shop for a major item which is often relatively expensive and thus requires some serious exploration, but typically in a limited scope of choices. (4) Minor-Item Shopping Queries are used by users to shop for minor items that are generally not very expensive, but still require some exploration of choices. (5) Hard-Choice Shopping Queries are used by users who want to deeply explore all the candidate products before finalizing the choice often appropriate when multiple products must be carefully compared with each other. These five categories form a taxonomy for E-Com queries and can shed light on how we may develop customized search technologies for each type of search queries to improve search engine utility.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Walmart Labs", "Walmart Labs", "Walmart Labs", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Parikshit Sondhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sondhi:Parikshit", "Mohit Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Mohit", "Pranam Kolari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolari:Pranam", "ChengXiang Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:ChengXiang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
