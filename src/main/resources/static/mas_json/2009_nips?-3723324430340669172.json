Our algorithm is randomized and, assuming an accuracy parameter \u220a \u2208 (0,1), selects and appropriately rescales in an unsupervised manner \u0398(k log(k/\u220a)/\u220a2) features from a dataset of arbitrary dimensions. We prove that, if we run any \u03b3-approximate k-means algorithm (\u03b3 \u2265 1) on the features selected using our method, we can find a (1 + (1 + \u220a) \u2265)-approximate partition with high probability.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Christos Boutsidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boutsidis:Christos", "Michael W.
