The most commonly used taxonomy to describe facial behaviour is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). FACS segments the visible effects of facial muscle activation into 30+ action units (AUs). AUs, which may occur alone and in thousands of combinations, can describe nearly all-possible facial expressions. Most existing methods for automatic AU detection treat the problem using one-vs-all classifiers and fail to exploit dependencies among AU and facial features. We introduce joint-patch and multi-label learning (JPML) to address these issues. JPML leverages group sparsity by selecting a sparse subset of facial patches while learning a multi-label classifier. In four of five comparisons on three diverse datasets, CK+, GFT, and BP4D, JPML produced the highest average F1 scores in comparison with state-of-the art.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Peking University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Peking University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kaili Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Kaili", "Wen-Sheng Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Wen=Sheng", "Fernando De la Torre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torre:Fernando_De_la", "Jeffrey F.
