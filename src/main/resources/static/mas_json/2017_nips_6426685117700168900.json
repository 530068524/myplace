{"title": "On Frank-Wolfe and Equilibrium Computation.", "fields": ["saddle", "correctness", "regret", "zero sum game", "iterated function"], "abstract": "We consider the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method for constrained convex optimization, and we show that this classical technique can be interpreted from a different perspective: FW emerges as the computation of an equilibrium (saddle point) of a special convex-concave zero sum game. This saddle-point trick relies on the existence of no-regret online learning to both generate a sequence of iterates but also to provide a proof of convergence through vanishing regret. We show that our stated equivalence has several nice properties, as it exhibits a modularity that gives rise to various old and new algorithms. We explore a few such resulting methods, and provide experimental results to demonstrate correctness and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jacob D.
