{"title": "GAIN: Missing Data Imputation using Generative Adversarial Nets.", "fields": ["discriminator", "generative grammar", "missing data", "imputation", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "We propose a novel method for imputing missing data by adapting the well-known Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) framework. Accordingly, we call our method Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (GAIN). The generator (G) observes some components of a real data vector, imputes the missing components conditioned on what is actually observed, and outputs a completed vector. The discriminator (D) then takes a completed vector and attempts to determine which components were actually observed and which were imputed. To ensure that D forces G to learn the desired distribution, we provide D with some additional information in the form of a hint vector. The hint reveals to D partial information about the missingness of the original sample, which is used by D to focus its attention on the imputation quality of particular components. This hint ensures that G does in fact learn to generate according to the true data distribution. We tested our method on various datasets and found that GAIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Jinsung Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Jinsung", "James Jordon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jordon:James", "Mihaela van der Schaar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaar:Mihaela_van_der"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
