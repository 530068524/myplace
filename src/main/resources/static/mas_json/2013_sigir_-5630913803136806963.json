{"title": "A general evaluation measure for document organization tasks.", "fields": ["document retrieval", "harmonic mean", "document clustering", "information access", "ranking"], "abstract": "A number of key Information Access tasks -- Document Retrieval, Clustering, Filtering, and their combinations -- can be seen as instances of a generic {\\em document organization} problem that establishes priority and relatedness relationships between documents (in other words, a problem of forming and ranking clusters). As far as we know, no analysis has been made yet on the evaluation of these tasks from a global perspective. In this paper we propose two complementary evaluation measures --  Reliability  and  Sensitivity  -- for the generic Document Organization task which are derived from a proposed set of formal constraints (properties that any suitable measure must satisfy).   In addition to be the first measures that can be applied to any mixture of ranking, clustering and filtering tasks, Reliability and Sensitivity satisfy more formal constraints than previously existing evaluation metrics for each of the subsumed tasks. Besides their formal properties, its most salient feature from an empirical point of view is their strictness: a high score according to the harmonic mean of Reliability and Sensitivity ensures a high score with any of the most popular evaluation metrics in all the Document Retrieval, Clustering and Filtering datasets used in our experiments.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["National University of Distance Education", "National University of Distance Education", "National University of Distance Education"], "authors": ["Enrique Amig\u00f3.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amig=oacute=:Enrique", "Julio Gonzalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonzalo:Julio", "Felisa Verdejo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verdejo:Felisa"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
