While the unprecedented scale of a product search portal enables to satisfy users with diverse needs, this scale also complicates product recommendation. Specifically, our target application poses a unique challenge of overcoming insufficient user profiles and feedbacks. To address this problem, we organize query results into clusters representing different user perceptions of similarity, and provide a navigational UI to handle personal interests. Specifically, we first discuss hybrid object clustering capturing diverse user interests from millions of Web pages and disambiguating different perceptions using feature-based similarity. We then discuss skyline object ranking to highlight interesting items at each cluster. Our demonstration illustrates how Product EntityCube can enrich user product shopping experiences.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jongwuk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jongwuk", "Seung-won Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Seung=won", "Zaiqing Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Zaiqing", "Ji-Rong Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Ji=Rong"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
