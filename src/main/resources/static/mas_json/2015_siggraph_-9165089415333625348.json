{"title": "Art directed rendering & shading using control images.", "fields": ["rendering", "stylized fact", "branching", "shader", "visual control"], "abstract": "In this work, we present a simple mathematical approach to art directed shader development. We have tested this approach over two semesters in an introductory level graduate rendering & shading class at Texas A&M University. The students in the class each chose an artist's style to mimic, and then easily created rendered images strongly resembling that style (see Figures 1). The method provides shader developers an intuitive process, giving them a high level of visual control in the creation of stylized depictions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Clemson University"], "authors": ["Ergun Akleman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akleman:Ergun", "Siran Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Siran", "Donald H.
