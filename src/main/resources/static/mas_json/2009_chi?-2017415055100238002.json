Twenty-six participants used MapLens to play a location-based game in a city centre. Comparisons to a group of 11 users with a standard 2D mobile map uncover phenomena that arise uniquely when interacting with AR features in the wild. The main finding is that AR features facilitate place-making by creating a constant need for referencing to the physical, and in that it allows for ease of bodily configurations for the group, encourages establishment of common ground, and thereby invites discussion, negotiation and public problem-solving. The main potential of AR maps lies in their use as a collaborative tool.", "citation": "Citations (173)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Nokia", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ann Morrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morrison:Ann", "Antti Oulasvirta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oulasvirta:Antti", "Peter Peltonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peltonen:Peter", "Saija Lemmel\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lemmel=auml=:Saija", "Giulio Jacucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacucci:Giulio", "Gerhard Reitmayr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reitmayr:Gerhard", "Jaana N\u00e4s\u00e4nen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/N=auml=s=auml=nen:Jaana", "Antti Juustila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juustila:Antti"], "pages": 10}
