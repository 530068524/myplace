To overcome this problem, we propose a new weakly-supervised learning setting called SU classification, where only similar (S) data pairs (two examples belong to the same class) and unlabeled (U) data are needed, instead of fully-supervised data. We show that an unbiased estimator of the classification risk can be obtained only from SU data, and its empirical risk minimizer achieves the optimal parametric convergence rate. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "RIKEN"], "authors": ["Han Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Han", "Gang Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Gang", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
