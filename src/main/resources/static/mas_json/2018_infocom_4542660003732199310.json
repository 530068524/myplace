For classification a method based on Kullback discrimination of sample and prototype distributions is used. The classification results for single features with one-dimensional feature value distributions and for pairs of complementary features with two-dimensional distributions are presented", "citation": "Citations (5,853)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Maryland, College Park", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University", "Microsoft", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "West Virginia University", "Yale University", "Guy's Hospital", "Guy's Hospital", "Monash University", "Monash University", "University of Queensland", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Guillermo Bielsa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bielsa:Guillermo", "Joan Palacios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palacios:Joan", "Adrian Loch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loch:Adrian", "Daniel Steinmetzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinmetzer:Daniel", "Paolo Casari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casari:Paolo", "Joerg Widmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widmer:Joerg"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
