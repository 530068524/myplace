We observe that it belongs to a wider class of norms, which we call the box-norms. Within this framework we derive an efficient algorithm to compute the proximity operator of the squared norm, improving upon the original method for the k-support norm. We extend the norms from the vector to the matrix setting and we introduce the spectral k-support norm. We study its properties and show that it is closely related to the multitask learning cluster norm. We apply the norms to real and synthetic matrix completion datasets. Our findings indicate that spectral k-support norm regularization gives state of the art performance, consistently improving over trace norm regularization and the matrix elastic net.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Andrew M.
