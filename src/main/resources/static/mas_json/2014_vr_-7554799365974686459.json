{"title": "Using relative head and hand-target features to predict intention in 3D moving-target selection.", "fields": ["virtual reality", "simulation", "solid modeling", "user interface", "decision tree"], "abstract": "Selection of moving targets is a common, yet complex task in human-computer interaction (HCI) and virtual reality (VR). Predicting user intention may be beneficial to address the challenges inherent in interaction techniques for moving-target selection. This article extends previous models by integrating relative head-target and hand-target features to predict intended moving targets. The features are calculated in a time window ending at roughly two-thirds of the total target selection time and evaluated using decision trees. With two targets, this model is able to predict user choice with up to ~ 72% accuracy on general moving-target selection tasks and up to ~ 78% by also including task-related target properties.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech", "Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech"], "authors": ["Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Casallas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casallas:Juan_Sebasti=aacute=n", "James H.
