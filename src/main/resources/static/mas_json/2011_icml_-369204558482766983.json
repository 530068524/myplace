{"title": "Domain Adaptation for Large-Scale Sentiment Classification: A Deep Learning Approach.", "fields": ["deep learning", "domain adaptation", "machine learning", "training set", "sentiment analysis"], "abstract": "The exponential increase in the availability of online reviews and recommendations makes sentiment classification an interesting topic in academic and industrial research. Reviews can span so many different domains that it is difficult to gather annotated training data for all of them. Hence, this paper studies the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, hereby a system is trained on labeled reviews from one source domain but is meant to be deployed on another. We propose a deep learning approach which learns to extract a meaningful representation for each review in an unsupervised fashion. Sentiment classifiers trained with this high-level feature representation clearly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of Amazon products. Furthermore, this method scales well and allowed us to successfully perform domain adaptation on a larger industrial-strength dataset of 22 domains.", "citation": "Citations (952)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Xavier Glorot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glorot:Xavier", "Antoine Bordes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bordes:Antoine", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua"], "pages": 8}
