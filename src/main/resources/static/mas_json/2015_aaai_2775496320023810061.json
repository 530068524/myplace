{"title": "A Counter Abstraction Technique for the Verification of Robot Swarms.", "fields": ["swarm behaviour", "abstraction", "model checking", "robot", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We study parameterised verification of robot swarms against temporal-epistemic specifications. We relax some of the significant restrictions assumed in the literature and present a counter abstraction approach that enable us to verify a potentially much smaller abstract model when checking a formula on a swarm of any size. We present an implementation and discuss experimental results obtained for the alpha algorithm for robot swarms.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Panagiotis Kouvaros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kouvaros:Panagiotis", "Alessio Lomuscio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lomuscio:Alessio"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
