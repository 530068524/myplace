{"title": "Groute: An Asynchronous Multi-GPU Programming Model for Irregular Computations.", "fields": ["reactive programming", "asynchronous communication", "general purpose computing on graphics processing units", "speedup", "programming paradigm"], "abstract": "Nodes with multiple GPUs are becoming the platform of choice for high-performance computing. However, most applications are written using bulk-synchronous programming models, which may not be optimal for irregular algorithms that benefit from low-latency, asynchronous communication. This paper proposes constructs for asynchronous multi-GPU programming, and describes their implementation in a thin runtime environment called Groute. Groute also implements common collective operations and distributed work-lists, enabling the development of irregular applications without substantial programming effort. We demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong scaling for a suite of irregular applications on 8-GPU and heterogeneous systems, yielding over 7x speedup for some algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Tal Ben-Nun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Nun:Tal", "Michael Sutton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sutton_0001:Michael", "Sreepathi Pai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pai:Sreepathi", "Keshav Pingali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pingali:Keshav"], "pages": 14}
