It is shown that this set of paths is measurable and computing its probability can be reduced to computing the reachability probability in a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDP). The reachability probability is characterized as the least solution of a system of integral equations and is shown to be approximated by solving a system of partial differential equations. For the special case of single-clock \\DTA, the system of integral equations can be transformed into a system of linear equations where the coefficients are solutions of ordinary differential equations.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "Formal Methods and Tools", "Formal Methods and Tools"], "authors": ["Taolue Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Taolue", "Tingting Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Tingting", "Joost-Pieter Katoen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katoen:Joost=Pieter", "Alexandru Mereacre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mereacre:Alexandru"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
