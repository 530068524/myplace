We formulate the problem of data gathering to compute multiround random linear function. We study the performance of in-network computation with compressive sensing in terms of energy consumption and latency in centralized and distributed fashions. For the centralized approach, we propose a tree-based protocol for computing multiround random linear function. The complexity of computation shows that the proposed protocol can save energy and reduce latency by a factor of \u0398(\u221an= log n) for data gathering comparing with the traditional approach, respectively. For the distributed approach, we propose a gossip-based approach and study the performance of energy and latency through theoretical analysis. We show that our approach needs fewer transmissions than the scheme using randomized gossip.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Haifeng Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Haifeng", "Shilin Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Shilin", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing", "Xiaohua Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Xiaohua"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
