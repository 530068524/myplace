This direction is based on a connection between lower bounds on the size of  non-commutative  arithmetic circuits and a problem about  commutative  degree four polynomials, the classical sum-of-squares problem: find the smallest n such that there exists an identity (x 1  2 +x 2  2 +\u2022\u2022 + x k  2 )\u2022 (y 1 ^2+y 2  2 +\u2022\u2022 + y k  2 )= f 1  2 +f 2  2 + ... +f n  2 , where each f i  = f i (X,Y) is bilinear in X={x 1 ,... ,x k } and Y={y 1 ,..., y k }. Over the complex numbers, we show that a sufficiently strong  super-linear  lower bound on n in, namely, n \u2265 k 1+e  with e >0, implies an  exponential  lower bound on the size of arithmetic circuits computing the non-commutative permanent.   More generally, we consider such sum-of-squares identities for any M polynomial h(X,Y), namely: h(X,Y) = f 1  2 +f 2  2 +...+f n  2 .   Again, proving n \u2265 k 1+e  in for  any  explicit h over the complex numbers gives an  exponential  lower bound for the non-commutative permanent. Our proofs relies on several new structure theorems for non-commutative circuits, as well as a non-commutative analog of Valiant's completeness of the permanent.   We proceed to prove such super-linear bounds in some restricted cases. We prove that n \u2265 \u03a9(k 6/5 ) in (1), if f 1 ,..., f n  are required to have  integer  coefficients. Over the  real  numbers, we construct an explicit M polynomial h such that n in (2) must be at least \u03a9(k 2 ). Unfortunately, these results do not imply circuit lower bounds. We also present other structural results about non-commutative arithmetic circuits. We show that any non-commutative circuit computing an  ordered  non-commutative polynomial can be efficiently transformed to a syntactically multilinear circuit computing that polynomial. The permanent, for example, is ordered. Hence, lower bounds on the size of syntactically multilinear circuits computing the permanent imply unrestricted non-commutative lower bounds. We also prove an exponential lower bound on the size of non-commutative syntactically multilinear circuit computing an explicit polynomial. This polynomial is, however, not ordered and an unrestricted circuit lower bound does not follow.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Institute for Advanced Study", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Institute for Advanced Study", "University of Calgary", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Pavel Hrubes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hrubes:Pavel", "Avi Wigderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigderson:Avi", "Amir Yehudayoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yehudayoff:Amir"], "pages": 10}
