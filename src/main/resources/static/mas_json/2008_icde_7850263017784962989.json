In this paper, we define a new class of techniques, called usage-based schema matching. The idea is to exploit information extracted from the query logs to find correspondences between attributes in the schemas to be matched. We propose methods to identify co-occurrence patterns between attributes in addition to other features such as their use in joins and with aggregate functions. Several scoring functions are considered to measure the similarity of the extracted features, and a genetic algorithm is employed to find the highest- score mappings between the two schemas. Our technique is suitable for matching schemas even when their attribute names are opaque. It can further be combined with existing techniques to obtain more accurate results. Our experimental study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the benefit of combining it with other existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Hazem Elmeleegy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elmeleegy:Hazem", "Mourad Ouzzani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouzzani:Mourad", "Ahmed K.
