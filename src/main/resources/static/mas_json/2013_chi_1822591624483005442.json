{"title": "SpaceTop: integrating 2D and spatial 3D interactions in a see-through desktop environment.", "fields": ["software", "augmented reality", "multimedia", "workspace", "modalities"], "abstract": "SpaceTop is a concept that fuses spatial 2D and 3D interactions in a single workspace. It extends the traditional desktop interface with interaction technology and visualization techniques that enable seamless transitions between 2D and 3D manipulations. SpaceTop allows users to type, click, draw in 2D, and directly manipulate interface elements that float in the 3D space above the keyboard. It makes it possible to easily switch from one modality to another, or to simultaneously use two modalities with different hands. We introduce hardware and software configurations for co-locating these various interaction modalities in a unified workspace using depth cameras and a transparent display. We describe new interaction and visualization techniques that allow users to interact with 2D elements floating in 3D space. We present the results from a preliminary user study that indicates the benefit of such hybrid workspaces.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Massachusettes  ... sachusetts, USA", "Massachusettes  ... sachusetts, USA"], "authors": ["Jinha Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jinha", "Alex Olwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olwal:Alex", "Hiroshi Ishii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishii_0001:Hiroshi", "Cati N.
