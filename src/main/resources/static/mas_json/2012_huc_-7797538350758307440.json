Digital object memories can provide added value and pave the way for new consumer-oriented IoT products and services. However, our research experience of employing digital object memories in different systems for reminiscing, mediation of second-hand retail environments and augmenting digital heritage experiences (e.g. in museums) also point to some significant challenges as to how people can interact with DOMs in situ. Based on this work we will put forth some of the key user experience challenges that we encountered when employing representations of DOMs in the real world in the course of the last two and a half years and discuss some alternative routes we wish to explore through future research.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Ralph Barthel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthel:Ralph", "Martin de Jode.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jode:Martin_de", "Andrew Hudson-Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hudson=Smith:Andrew"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
