{"title": "Collaborative awareness in multimedia search.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "multimedia", "computer science", "multimedia search"], "abstract": "Awareness of another's activity is an important aspect of facilitating collaboration between users, enabling an \"understanding of the activities of others\" [1]. Many environments where multimedia search is required are collaborative in nature, such as when a group of artists and animators are engaged in the production of a multimedia product. In this paper we introduce a study which used a novel evaluation methodology, where pairs of users competed to find the most relevant shots for a topic, with the aim of evaluating the role of awareness within an environment conductive to its use. Results based on event log and questionnaire data are reported, and conclusions presented illustrating some of the issues and pitfalls of using awareness in a video search system.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["Robert Villa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villa:Robert", "Nicholas Gildea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gildea:Nicholas", "Joemon M.
