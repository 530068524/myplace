The goal is to support the framework's users in making the best use of the framework without overwhelming the users with documentation. In this work, we show how we realized this goal using a small set of abstract framework constraints and a collection of heuristics. We took a real-life complex framework and extracted from its support history a set of framework constraints that we refined into five abstract framework constraints. We then developed heuristics to enable the easy specification and the automatic checking of instances of these constraints using a static analysis tool. The result is a system that allows one to define practical framework constraints and provides a mechanism to check them automatically in the user's code.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Princeton University"], "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Bronsard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bronsard:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
