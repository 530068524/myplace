Based on a novel and natural definition of weak online learnability, we develop two online boosting algorithms. The first algorithm is an online version of boost-by-majority. By proving a matching lower bound, we show that this algorithm is essentially optimal in terms of the number of weak learners and the sample complexity needed to achieve a specified accuracy. The second algorithm is adaptive and parameter-free, albeit not optimal.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Princeton University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Princeton University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Alina Beygelzimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beygelzimer:Alina", "Satyen Kale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kale:Satyen", "Haipeng Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Haipeng"], "pages": 5}
