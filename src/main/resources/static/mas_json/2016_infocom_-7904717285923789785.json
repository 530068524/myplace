The problem of influence maximization in online social networks has been extensively studied. However, in prior works, influence propagation in the physical world, which is also an indispensable factor, is not considered. The Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) are a special kind of online social networks in which people can share location-embedded information. In this paper, we make use of mobile crowdsourced data obtained from location-based social network services to study influence maximization in LBSNs. A novel network model and an influence propagation model taking influence propagation in both online social networks and the physical world into consideration are proposed. An event activation position selection problem is formalized and a corresponding solution is provided. The experimental results indicate that the proposed influence propagation model is meaningful and the activation position selection algorithm has high performance.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Georgia State University", "University of North Georgia", "Georgia State University"], "authors": ["Ji Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0007:Ji", "Zhipeng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Zhipeng", "Mingyuan Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Mingyuan", "Yingshu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingshu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
