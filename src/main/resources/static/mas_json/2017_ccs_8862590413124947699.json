{"title": "Viden: Attacker Identification on In-Vehicle Networks.", "fields": ["implementation", "exploit", "transmitter", "electronic control unit", "can bus"], "abstract": "Various defense schemes --- which determine the presence of an attack on the in-vehicle network --- have recently been proposed. However, they fail to identify  which  Electronic Control Unit (ECU) actually mounted the attack. Clearly, pinpointing the attacker ECU is essential for fast/efficient forensic, isolation, security patch, etc. To meet this need, we propose a novel scheme, called  Viden  (Voltage-based attacker identification), which can identify the attacker ECU by measuring and utilizing voltages on the in-vehicle network. The first phase of  Viden , called  ACK learning , determines whether or not the measured voltage signals really originate from the genuine message transmitter.  Viden  then exploits the voltage measurements to construct and update the transmitter ECUs' voltage profiles as their fingerprints. It finally uses the voltage profiles to identify the attacker ECU. Since  Viden  adapts its profiles to changes inside/outside of the vehicle, it can pinpoint the attacker ECU under various conditions. Moreover, its efficiency and design-compliance with modern in-vehicle network implementations make  Viden  practical and easily deployable. Our extensive experimental evaluations on both a CAN bus prototype and two real vehicles have shown that  Viden  can accurately fingerprint ECUs based solely on voltage measurements and thus identify the attacker ECU with a low false identification rate of 0.2%.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Kyong-Tak Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Kyong=Tak", "Kang G.
