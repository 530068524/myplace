{"title": "ACR: Active Collision Recovery in Dense Wireless Sensor Networks.", "fields": ["network packet", "automatic repeat request", "testbed", "carrier sense multiple access", "packet loss"], "abstract": "Packet collision causes packet loss and wastes resources in wireless networks. It becomes even worse in dense WSNs, due to burst-traffic and congestion around sinks. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol to recover collided packets. Our experiments on a testbed reveal that collisions between long packets and short packets cause a partial error pattern on collided packets, which can be used for efficient recovery. We give a theoretical analysis that demonstrates that combining such collision recovery with CSMA protocols achieves a significant performance improvement. Then, we design ACR, an Active Collision Recovery protocol, which actively converts most potential collisions into LS-collisions, and then applies a lightweight FEC scheme to recover collided packets with such partial error patterns. We implement ACR on a Tmote testbed, and compare its performance with other packet recovery schemes. Results show that ACR significantly reduces the number of retransmissions, and achieves around 25% improvement on transmission efficiency over other schemes.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "College of William & Mary", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Yafeng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yafeng", "Gang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Gang", "John A.
