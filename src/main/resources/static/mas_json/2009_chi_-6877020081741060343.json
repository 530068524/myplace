Here, we describe our deployment of MobiTags, a system to help museum visitors interact with a collection of \"open storage\" exhibits, those where the museum provides little curatorial information. MobiTags integrates social tagging, art information, and a map to support navigation and collaborative curation of these open storage collections. We studied 23 people's use of MobiTags in a local museum, combining interview data with device use logs and tracking of people's movements to understand how MobiTags affected their navigation and experience in the museum. Despite a lack of social cues, people feel a strong sense of social presence--and social pressure--through seeing others' tags. The tight coupling of tags, item information, and map features also supported a rich set of practices around these modes of navigation.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dan Cosley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosley:Dan", "Jonathan Baxter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baxter:Jonathan", "Soyoung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Soyoung", "Brian Alson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alson:Brian", "Saeko Nomura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nomura:Saeko", "Phil Adams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adams:Phil", "Chethan Sarabu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarabu:Chethan", "Geri Gay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gay:Geri"], "pages": 10}
