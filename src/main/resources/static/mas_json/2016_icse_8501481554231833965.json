{"title": "Improving refactoring speed by 10X.", "fields": ["codebase", "abstract syntax", "precondition", "code refactoring", "software bug"], "abstract": "Refactoring engines are standard tools in today's  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) . They allow programmers to perform one refactoring at a time, but programmers need more. Most design patterns in the Gang-of-Four text can be written as a refactoring script -- a programmatic sequence of refactorings. In this paper, we present R3, a new Java refactoring engine that supports refactoring scripts. It builds a main-memory, non-persistent database to encode Java entity declarations (e.g., packages, classes, methods), their containment relationships, and language features such as inheritance and modifiers. Unlike classical refactoring engines that modify  Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) , R3 refactorings modify only the database; refactored code is produced only when pretty-printing ASTs that reference database changes. R3 performs comparable precondition checks to those of the  Eclipse Java Development Tools (JDT)  but R3's codebase is about half the size of the JDT refactoring engine and runs an order of magnitude faster. Further, a user study shows that R3 improved the success rate of retrofitting design patterns by 25% up to 50%.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Oregon State University", "University of the Basque Country"], "authors": ["Jongwook Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jongwook", "Don S.
