We present a technique to quantify the fall-off in accuracy of spatially carved volumetric representations of humans based on real world constraints. We describe an example of such a quantitative evaluation using a synthetic dataset of typical sports motion in a tennis court scenario, created using computer graphics techniques and motion capture data. Experiments are performed using a baseline voxel carving technique that includes player tracking, background subtraction and player voxel carving. This type of quantitative evaluation could be used by amateur sporting clubs without a sophisticated capture infrastructure to understand how best to instrument a camera network in order to obtain a good trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and installation cost.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Dublin City University", "Dublin City University", "Dublin City University"], "authors": ["David S.
