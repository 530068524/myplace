{"title": "Fused Table Scans: Combining AVX-512 and JIT to Double the Performance of Multi-Predicate Scans.", "fields": ["operator", "full table scan", "predicate", "vectorization", "instruction set"], "abstract": "Recent work has started to combine two approaches for faster query execution: Vectorization and Just-in-Time Compilation (JIT). Combining the advantages of block-at-a-time and tuple-at-a-time processing opens up opportunities for performance improvements. In this context, we present the Fused Table Scan, a just-in-time-compiled scan operator for consecutive table scans. It makes use of the Intel AVX-512 instruction set to combine multiple predicates in a single scan. This reduces the number of instruction-level branches and makes memory access more efficient. We show that the Fused Table Scan doubles the scan performance in most cases and can achieve a speed-up of up to a factor of ten over sequential execution. Furthermore, we discuss which query plans profit from the Fused Table Scan and how the operator code can be generated at runtime.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "authors": ["Markus Dreseler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dreseler:Markus", "Jan Kossmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kossmann:Jan", "Johannes Frohnhofen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frohnhofen:Johannes", "Matthias Uflacker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uflacker:Matthias", "Hasso Plattner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plattner:Hasso"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
