{"title": "Computing Infinite Plans for LTL Goals Using a Classical Planner.", "fields": ["computer science", "planner", "computation", "buchi automaton", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "Classical planning has been notably successful in synthesizing finite plans to achieve states where propositional goals hold. In the last few years, classical planning has also been extended to incorporate temporally extended goals, expressed in temporal logics such as LTL, to impose restrictions on the state sequences generated by finite plans. In this work, we take the next step and consider the computation of infinite plans for achieving arbitrary LTL goals. We show that infinite plans can also be obtained efficiently by calling a classical planner once over a classical planning encoding that represents and extends the composition of the planning domain and the Buchi automaton representing the goal. This compilation scheme has been implemented and a number of experiments are reported.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Univ.
