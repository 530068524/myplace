{"title": "Approximating the Held-Karp Bound for Metric TSP in Nearly-Linear Time.", "fields": ["approximation algorithm", "time complexity", "graph", "data structure", "shortest path problem"], "abstract": "We give a nearly linear-time randomized approximation scheme for the Held-Karp bound [22] for Metric-TSP. Formally, given an undirected edge-weighted graph G = (V,E) on m edges and \u03b5 0, the algorithm outputs in O(m log^4 n/\u03b5^2) time, with high probability, a (1 + \u03b5)-approximation to the Held-Karp bound on the Metric-TSP instance induced by the shortest path metric on G. The algorithm can also be used to output a corresponding solution to the Subtour Elimination LP. We substantially improve upon the O(m^2 log^2(m)/\u03b5^2) running time achieved previously by Garg and Khandekar.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Chandra Chekuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chekuri:Chandra", "Kent Quanrud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quanrud:Kent"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
