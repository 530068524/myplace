Performance of texture classification is however still lacking for some challenging cases, largely due to the high intra-class variation and low inter-class distinction. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a sub-categorization model for texture classification. By clustering each class into subcategories, classification probabilities at the subcategory-level are computed based on between-subcategory distinctiveness and within-subcategory representativeness. These subcategory probabilities are then fused based on their contribution levels and cluster qualities. This fused probability is added to the multiclass classification probability to obtain the final class label. Our method was applied to texture classification on three challenging datasets - KTH-TIPS2, FMD and DTD, and has shown excellent performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "University of Sydney"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yang Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song_0001:Yang", "Weidong Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Weidong", "Qing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qing", "Fan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0013:Fan", "David Dagan Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:David_Dagan", "Heng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heng"], "pages": 9}
