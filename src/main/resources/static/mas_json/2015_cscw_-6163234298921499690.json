{"title": "Restructuring Human Infrastructure: The Impact of EHR Deployment in a Volunteer-Dependent Clinic.", "fields": ["restructuring", "software deployment", "workforce", "workaround", "volunteer"], "abstract": "Non-profit organizations (NPOs) are often resource-restricted and rely on volunteers to function. As such, their human infrastructure - the social system supporting work - is different from conventional organizations, and technologies that function in a traditional organization with a stable workforce may not work in NPOs. Through an investigation of the deployment of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system in a safety-net free clinic serving underprivileged populations, we report how the EHR disrupted the human infrastructure - namely, the work typically enacted by volunteers. Specifically, there was a mismatch between the technological and human infrastructures leading to diminished volunteer roles, an increased workload for paid employees, and a negative impact on the quality of patient care. In turn, employees acted to reconcile the disrupted human infrastructure by creating new work roles for volunteers, re-establishing the quality of patient care, and developing workarounds for volunteers to resume their volunteer work. Finally we discuss how the commercial EHR system failed to support the fluid volunteer-based human infrastructure of the free clinic.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of California, Irvine", "Syracuse University", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Charlotte Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Charlotte", "Yunan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yunan", "Bryan C.
