{"title": "Semi-Federated Scheduling of Parallel Real-Time Tasks on Multiprocessors.", "fields": ["fixed priority pre emptive scheduling", "two level scheduling", "multiprocessor scheduling", "fair share scheduling", "gang scheduling"], "abstract": "Federated scheduling is a promising approach to schedule parallel real-time tasks on multi-cores, where each heavy task exclusively executes on a number of dedicated processors, while light tasks are treated as sequential sporadic tasks and share the remaining processors. However, federated scheduling suffers resource waste since a heavy task with processing capacity requirement x+epsilon (where x is an integer and 0 epsilon 1) needs x+1 dedicated processors. In the extreme case, almost half of the processing capacity is wasted. In this paper we propose the semi-federate scheduling approach, which only grants x dedicated processors to a heavy task with processing capacity requirement x+epsilon, and schedules the remaining epsilon part together with light tasks on shared processors. Experiments with randomly generated task sets show the semi-federated scheduling approach significantly outperforms not only federated scheduling, but also all existing approaches for scheduling parallel real-time tasks on multi-cores.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Uppsala University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Xu Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xu", "Nan Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Nan", "Xiang Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Xiang", "Wang Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi_0001:Wang"], "pages": 12}
