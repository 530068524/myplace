Pareto optimization has been shown quite effective in applications; however, it has little theoretical support. This work theoretically compares Pareto optimization with a penalty approach, which is a common method transforming a constrained optimization into an unconstrained optimization. We prove that on two large classes of constrained Boolean optimization problems, minimum matroid optimization (P-solvable) and minimum cost coverage (NP-hard), Pareto optimization is more efficient than the penalty function method for obtaining the optimal and approximate solutions, respectively. Furthermore, on a minimum cost coverage instance, we also show the advantage of Pareto optimization over a greedy algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Chao Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Chao", "Yang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Yang", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
