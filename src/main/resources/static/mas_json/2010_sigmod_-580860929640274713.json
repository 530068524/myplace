In those networks however, continuous queries are the rule. To minimize the communication costs of join processing, it is important to not ship non-joining tuples. In order to know which tuples do not join, prior work has proposed a precomputation step. For continuous queries however, repeating the precomputation for each execution is unnecessary and leaves aside that data tends to be temporally correlated. In this paper, we present a filtering approach for the processing of continuous join queries. We propose to keep the filters and to maintain them. The problems are determining the sizes of the filters and deciding which filters to update. Simplistic approaches result in bad performance. We show how to compute solutions that are optimal. Experiments on real-world sensor data indicate that our method performs close to a theoretical optimum and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art join approaches.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mirco Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Mirco", "Klemens B\u00f6hm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hm:Klemens", "Erik Buchmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buchmann:Erik"], "pages": 12}
