{"title": "Large-scale Semantic Parsing via Schema Matching and Lexicon Extension.", "fields": ["semantic computing", "lr parser", "lexicon", "schema matching", "parsing"], "abstract": "Supervised training procedures for semantic parsers produce high-quality semantic parsers, but they have difficulty scaling to large databases because of the sheer number of logical constants for which they must see labeled training data. We present a technique for developing semantic parsers for large databases based on a reduction to standard supervised training algorithms, schema matching, and pattern learning. Leveraging techniques from each of these areas, we develop a semantic parser for Freebase that is capable of parsing questions with an F1 that improves by 0.42 over a purely-supervised learning algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (196)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Qingqing Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Qingqing", "Alexander Yates.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yates:Alexander"], "pages": 11}
