Due to the long duration, it is often desirable to authenticate only a segment of audio signal. To the authors' knowledge, this important issue has not been seriously researched so far. In this paper, a novel authentication algorithm is proposed for the purpose of audio fragment authentication. SIFT descriptor originated from computer vision field is introduced and calculated on audio spectrogram to accomplish the tasks of fragment alignment, time-domain blocking, cropping and inserting identification etc. Experiments show reliable discrimination between admissible and malicious manipulations, precise tamper localization and classification.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang", "Wei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0012:Wei", "Yue Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Yue"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
