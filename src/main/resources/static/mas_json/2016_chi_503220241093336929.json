{"title": "Social Inequality and HCI: The View from Political Economy.", "fields": ["political economy", "social inequality", "conceptual history", "computer science"], "abstract": "Massive changes in the economy and computing technology in recent years call for a close examination of their relationship. Changes include a broad range of topics and issues, some of which directly and crucially fall within the purview of HCI research and practice. We propose a perspective that engages issues of political economy, with a focus on social inequality. We introduce some of the history of concepts of this perspective, and discuss implications for HCI. We observe that practical and conceptual resources within HCI for considering political economy and inequality are emerging.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Hamid R.
