Dynamic access network adaptation to customers' demands is one of the most promising paths taken by network operators. To that end, one must be able to process large amount of mobile traffic data and outline the network utilization in an automated manner. In this paper, we propose a framework to analyze broad sets of Call Detail Records (CDRs) so as to define categories of mobile call profiles and classify network usages accordingly. We evaluate our framework on a CDR dataset including more than 300 million calls recorded in an urban area over 5 months. We show how our approach allows to classify similar network usage profiles and to tell apart normal and outlying call behaviors.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "IEIIT, Turin, Italy"], "authors": ["Diala Naboulsi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naboulsi:Diala", "Razvan Stanica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stanica:Razvan", "Marco Fiore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiore:Marco"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
