It is complementary to existing localization techniques. A draw-back of the localization method is that when a transmitter is at the edge of an area, an algorithm with isotropic error will estimate its location in the wrong area at least half of the time. In contrast, perimeter distinction classifies the location as being in one area or the adjacent regardless of the transmitter position within the area. In this paper, we use the naturally different wireless fading conditions to accurately distinguish locations across perimeters. We examine the use of two types of wireless measurements: received signal strength (RSS) and wireless link signature (WLS), and propose multiple methods to retain good distinction rates even when the receiver faces power manipulation by malicious transmitters. Using extensive measurements of indoor and outdoor perimeters, we find that WLS outperforms RSS in various fading conditions. Even without using signal power WLS can achieve accurate perimeter distinction up to 80%. When we train our perimeter distinction method with multiple measurements within the same perimeter, we show that we are able to improve the accuracy of perimeter distinction, up to 98%.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Inner Mongolia University", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Junxing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Junxing", "Sneha Kumar Kasera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasera:Sneha_Kumar", "Neal Patwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patwari:Neal", "Piyush Rai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rai:Piyush"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
