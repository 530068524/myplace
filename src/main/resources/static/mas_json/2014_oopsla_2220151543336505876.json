{"title": "From object algebras to attribute grammars.", "fields": ["visitor pattern", "church encoding", "tree adjoining grammar", "scala", "l attributed grammar"], "abstract": "Oliveira and Cook (2012) and Oliveira et al. (2013) have recently introduced object algebras as a program structuring technique to improve the modularity and extensibility of programs. We analyze the relationship between object algebras and attribute grammars (AGs), a formalism to augment context-free grammars with attributes. We present an extension of the object algebra technique with which the full class of L-attributed grammars - an important class of AGs that corresponds to one-pass compilers - can be encoded in Scala. The encoding is modular (attributes can be defined and type-checked separately), scalable (the size of the encoding is linear in the size of the AG specification) and compositional (each AG artifact is represented as a semantic object of the host language). To evaluate these claims, we have formalized the encoding and re-implemented a one-pass compiler for a subset of C with our technique. We also discuss how advanced features of modern AG systems, such as higher-order and parameterized attributes, reference attributes, and forwarding can be supported.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Marburg", "University of Marburg", "University of Marburg"], "authors": ["Tillmann Rendel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rendel:Tillmann", "Jonathan Immanuel Brachth\u00e4user.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brachth=auml=user:Jonathan_Immanuel", "Klaus Ostermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostermann:Klaus"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2014", "pages": 19}
