However, many spacecraft operate in high-radiation environments in which the reliability of dataintensive computation is not known. This paper presents the first study of radiation sensitivity for k-means clustering. Our key findings are 1) k-means data structures differ in sensitivity, which is not determined solely by the amount of memory exposed; 2) no special radiation protection is needed below a data-set-dependent radiation threshold, enabling the use of faster, smaller, and cheaper onboard memory; and 3) subsampling improves radiation tolerance slightly, but the use of kd-trees unfortunately reduces tolerance. Our conclusions can help tailor k-means for use in future high-radiation environments.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kiri L.
