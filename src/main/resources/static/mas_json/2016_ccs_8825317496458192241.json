{"title": "Instant and Robust Authentication and Key Agreement among Mobile Devices.", "fields": ["pre shared key", "key distribution", "secure communication", "group key", "channel state information"], "abstract": "Device-to-device communication is important to emerging mobile applications such as Internet of Things and mobile social networks. Authentication and key agreement among multiple legitimate devices is the important first step to build a secure communication channel. Existing solutions put the devices into physical proximity and use the common radio environment as a proof of identities and the common secret to agree on a same key. However they experience very slow secret bit generation rate and high errors, requiring several minutes to build a 256-bit key. In this work, we design and implement an authentication and key agreement protocol for mobile devices, called The Dancing Signals (TDS), being extremely fast and error-free. TDS uses channel state information (CSI) as the common secret among legitimate devices. It guarantees that only devices in a close physical proximity can agree on a key and any device outside a certain distance gets nothing about the key. Compared with existing solutions, TDS is very fast and robust, supports group key agreement, and can effectively defend against predictable channel attacks. We implement TDS using commodity off-the-shelf 802.11n devices and evaluate its performance via extensive experiments. Results show that TDS only takes a couple of seconds to make devices agree on a 256-bit secret key with high entropy.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Wei Xi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xi:Wei", "Chen Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian_0001:Chen", "Jinsong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jinsong", "Kun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Kun", "Sheng Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Sheng", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Jizhong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Jizhong"], "pages": 12}
