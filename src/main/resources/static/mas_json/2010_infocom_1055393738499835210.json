Existing decentralized defences have largely been designed for peer-to-peer networks but not for mobile networks. That is why we propose a new decentralized defence for portable devices and call it MobID. The idea is that a device manages two small networks in which it stores information about the devices it meets: its network of friends contains honest devices, and its network of foes contains suspicious devices. By reasoning on these two networks, the device is then able to determine whether an unknown individual is carrying out a sybil attack or not. We evaluate the extent to which MobID reduces the number of interactions with sybil attackers and consequently enables collaborative applications. We do so using real mobility and social network data. We also assess computational and communication costs of MobID on mobile phones.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University College London"], "authors": ["Daniele Quercia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quercia:Daniele", "Stephen Hailes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hailes:Stephen"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
