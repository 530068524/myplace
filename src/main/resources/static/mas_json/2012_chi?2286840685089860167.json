These systems typically present force to a learner's palm by directly actuating the tool. However, this approach is sometimes ineffective because learners have difficulty sensing the haptic feedback from the tool when they are holding it tightly. Thus, we propose a different approach (OCHD) that effectively guides the learner's hand by presenting force to the back of his/her hand as if an instructor is holding it. A preliminary experiment showed that OCHD effectively guides users with less actuator drive force than cases where the tool is directly actuated.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "NTT Communicati ... n, Kyoto, Japan"], "authors": ["Vibol Yem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yem:Vibol", "Hideaki Kuzuoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzuoka:Hideaki", "Naomi Yamashita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamashita:Naomi", "Ryota Shibusawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shibusawa:Ryota", "Hiroaki Yano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yano:Hiroaki", "Jun Yamashita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamashita:Jun"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
