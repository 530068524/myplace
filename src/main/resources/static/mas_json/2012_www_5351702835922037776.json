Essentially, through analyzing inner social relationships in the criminal account community, we find that criminal accounts tend to be socially connected, forming a small-world network. We also find that criminal hubs, sitting in the center of the social graph, are more inclined to follow criminal accounts. Through analyzing outer social relationships between criminal accounts and their social friends outside the criminal account community, we reveal three categories of accounts that have close friendships with criminal accounts. Through these analyses, we provide a novel and effective criminal account inference algorithm by exploiting criminal accounts' social relationships and semantic coordinations.", "citation": "Citations (239)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Chao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Chao", "Robert Chandler Harkreader.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harkreader:Robert_Chandler", "Jialong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jialong", "Seungwon Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Seungwon", "Guofei Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Guofei"], "conf": "www", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
