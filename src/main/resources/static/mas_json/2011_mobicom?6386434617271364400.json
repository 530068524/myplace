Many management tasks, e.g. optimizing AP placement and detecting rogue APs, require a user to efficiently determine the location of wireless APs. Unlike prior localization techniques that require either specialized equipment or extensive outdoor measurements, we propose a way to locate APs in real-time using commodity smartphones. Our insight is that by rotating a wireless receiver (smartphone) around a signal-blocking obstacle (the user's body), we can effectively emulate the sensitivity and functionality of a directional antenna. Our measurements show that we can detect these signal strength artifacts on multiple smartphone platforms for a variety of outdoor environments. We develop a model for detecting signal dips caused by blocking obstacles, and use it to produce a directional analysis technique that accurately predicts the direction of the AP, along with an associated confidence value. The result is Borealis, a system that provides accurate directional guidance and leads users to a desired AP after a few measurements. Detailed measurements show that Borealis is significantly more accurate than other real-time localization systems, and is nearly as accurate as offline approaches using extensive wireless measurements.", "citation": "Citations (156)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "Xian Jiaotong U ... y, Xi'an, China"], "authors": ["Zengbin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zengbin", "Xia Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xia", "Weile Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Weile", "Yuanyang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yuanyang", "Gang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0011:Gang", "Ben Y.
