Conventional online learning algorithms cannot be applied directly to one-pass AUC optimization because AUC is measured by a sum of losses defined over pairs of instances from different classes. We develop a regression-based algorithm which only needs to maintain the first and second-order statistics of training data in memory, resulting in a storage requirement independent of the number of training data. To efficiently handle high-dimensional data, we develop two deterministic algorithms that approximate the covariance matrices. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Alibaba Group", "Michigan State University", "Alibaba Group", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Michigan State University", "Nanjing University", "NEC Laboratorie ...
