{"title": "End-to-End Face Detection and Cast Grouping in Movies Using Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi Clustering.", "fields": ["erd\u0151s renyi model", "face detection", "false positive paradox", "data set", "end to end principle"], "abstract": "We present an end-to-end system for detecting and clustering faces by identity in full-length movies. Unlike works that start with a predefined set of detected faces, we consider the end-to-end problem of detection and clustering together. We make three separate contributions. First, we combine a state-of-the-art face detector with a generic tracker to extract high quality face tracklets. We then introduce a novel clustering method, motivated by the classic graph theory results of Erdos and Renyi. It is based on the observations that large clusters can be fully connected by joining just a small fraction of their point pairs, while just a single connection between two different people can lead to poor clustering results. This suggests clustering using a verification system with very few false positives but perhaps moderate recall. We introduce a novel verification method, rank-1 counts verification, that has this property, and use it in a link-based clustering scheme. Finally, we define a novel end-to-end detection and clustering evaluation metric allowing us to assess the accuracy of the entire end-to-end system. We present state-of-the-art results on multiple video data sets and also on standard face databases.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["KAIST", "Tsinghua University", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Sou-Young Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Sou=Young", "Hang Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Hang", "Chris Stauffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stauffer:Chris", "Erik G.
