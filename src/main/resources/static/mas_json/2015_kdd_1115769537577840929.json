{"title": "On the Discovery of Evolving Truth.", "fields": ["text mining", "machine learning", "dynamic data", "big data", "synthetic data"], "abstract": "In the era of big data, information regarding the same objects can be collected from increasingly more sources. Unfortunately, there usually exist conflicts among the information coming from different sources. To tackle this challenge, truth discovery, i.e., to integrate multi-source noisy information by estimating the reliability of each source, has emerged as a hot topic. In many real world applications, however, the information may come sequentially, and as a consequence, the truth of objects as well as the reliability of sources may be dynamically evolving. Existing truth discovery methods, unfortunately, cannot handle such scenarios. To address this problem, we investigate the temporal relations among both object truths and source reliability, and propose an incremental truth discovery framework that can dynamically update object truths and source weights upon the arrival of new data. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that the proposed method is guaranteed to converge at a fast rate. The experiments on three real world applications and a set of synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art truth discovery methods.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo", "LinkedIn"], "authors": ["Yaliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yaliang", "Qi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0012:Qi", "Jing Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jing", "Lu Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Lu", "Bo Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Bo", "Wei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan_0001:Wei", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
