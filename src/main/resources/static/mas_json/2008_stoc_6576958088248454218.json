{"title": "Tight rmr lower bounds for mutual exclusion and other problems.", "fields": ["mutual exclusion", "bounded function", "cache coherence", "shared memory", "distributed shared memory"], "abstract": "We investigate the remote memory references (RMRs) complexity of deterministic processes that communicate by reading and writing shared memory in asynchronous cache-coherent and distributed shared-memory multiprocessors. We define a class of algorithms that we call  order encoding . By applying information-theoretic arguments, we prove that every order encoding algorithm, shared by n processes, has an execution that incurs \u03a9(n log n) RMRs. From this we derive the same lower bound for the mutual exclusion, bounded counter and store/collect synchronization problems. The bounds we obtain for these problems are tight. It follows from the results of [10] that our lower bounds hold also for algorithms that can use comparison primitives and load-linked/store-conditional in addition to reads and writes. Our mutual exclusion lower bound proves a longstanding conjecture of Anderson and Kim.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Calgary", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Hagit Attiya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Attiya:Hagit", "Danny Hendler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hendler:Danny", "Philipp Woelfel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woelfel:Philipp"], "pages": 10}
