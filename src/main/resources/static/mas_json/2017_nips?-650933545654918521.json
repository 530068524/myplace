We study how these measures can ensure generalization, highlighting the importance of scale normalization, and making a connection between sharpness and PAC-Bayes theory. We then investigate how well the measures explain different observed phenomena.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Institute for Advanced Study", "TTI-Chicago"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Behnam Neyshabur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neyshabur:Behnam", "Srinadh Bhojanapalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhojanapalli:Srinadh", "David McAllester.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McAllester:David", "Nati Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nati"], "pages": 10}
