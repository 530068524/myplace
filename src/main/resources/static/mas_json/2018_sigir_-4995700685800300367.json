{"title": "BiNE: Bipartite Network Embedding.", "fields": ["vertex", "transitive relation", "feature learning", "embedding", "ranking"], "abstract": "This work develops a representation learning method for bipartite networks. While existing works have developed various embedding methods for network data, they have primarily focused on homogeneous networks in general and overlooked the special properties of bipartite networks. As such, these methods can be suboptimal for embedding bipartite networks. In this paper, we propose a new method named BiNE, short for Bipartite Network Embedding, to learn the vertex representations for bipartite networks. By performing biased random walks purposefully, we generate vertex sequences that can well preserve the long-tail distribution of vertices in the original bipartite network. We then propose a novel optimization framework by accounting for both the explicit relations (i.e., observed links) and implicit relations (i.e., unobserved but transitive links) in learning the vertex representations. We conduct extensive experiments on several real datasets covering the tasks of link prediction (classification), recommendation (personalized ranking), and visualization. Both quantitative results and qualitative analysis verify the effectiveness and rationality of our BiNE method.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "National University of Singapore", "East China Normal University"], "authors": ["Ming Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Ming", "Leihui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Leihui", "Xiangnan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Xiangnan", "Aoying Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Aoying"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
