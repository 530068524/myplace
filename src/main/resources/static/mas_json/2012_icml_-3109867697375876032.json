{"title": "Rethinking Collapsed Variational Bayes Inference for LDA.", "fields": ["inference", "bayes theorem", "divergence", "latent dirichlet allocation", "taylor series"], "abstract": "We propose a novel interpretation of the collapsed variational Bayes inference with a zero-order Taylor expansion approximation, called CVB0 inference, for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We clarify the properties of the CVB0 inference by using the \u03b1-divergence. We show that the CVB0 inference is composed of two different divergence projections: \u03b1 = 1 and -1. This interpretation will help shed light on CVB0 works.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Issei Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Issei", "Hiroshi Nakagawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakagawa:Hiroshi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
