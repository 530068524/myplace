We propose a definition of commitment-based interaction protocols, characterized by the decoupling of the constitutive and the regulative specifications, where the latter is explicitly represented based on constraints among commitments. The 2CL language, for writing regulative specifications, is also presented.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Turin", "University of Turin", "University of Turin", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano"], "authors": ["Matteo Baldoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldoni:Matteo", "Cristina Baroglio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baroglio:Cristina", "Elisa Marengo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marengo:Elisa", "Viviana Patti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patti:Viviana"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 5}
