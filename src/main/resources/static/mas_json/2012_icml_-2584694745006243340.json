{"title": "Predicting accurate probabilities with a ranking loss.", "fields": ["ranking", "machine learning", "pattern recognition", "logistic regression", "probability distribution"], "abstract": "In many real-world applications of machine learning classifiers, it is essential to predict the probability of an example belonging to a particular class. This paper proposes a simple technique for predicting probabilities based on optimizing a ranking loss, followed by isotonic regression. This semi-parametric technique offers both good ranking and regression performance, and models a richer set of probability distributions than statistical workhorses such as logistic regression. We provide experimental results that show the effectiveness of this technique on real-world applications of probability prediction.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of Toronto", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Aditya Krishna Menon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menon:Aditya_Krishna", "Xiaoqian Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xiaoqian", "Shankar Vembu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vembu:Shankar", "Charles Elkan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkan:Charles", "Lucila Ohno-Machado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohno=Machado:Lucila"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
