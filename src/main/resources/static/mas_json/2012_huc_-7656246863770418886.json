In this paper, we introduce an activity recognition approach based on causal modeling and probabilistic plan recognition. To evaluate the performance of our approach systematically, we generated sensor data with different error rates using a simulation. This data served as input for the activity recognition in a series of experiments. In these experiments we stepwise introduced and combined additional sources of uncertainty, i.e., different duration models and ignoring certain sensors, to demonstrate the robustness of our approach. Our evaluation shows that Computational Causal Behavior Models provide a basis for a robust activity recognition system.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Rostock", "University of Rostock", "University of Rostock", "University of Rostock"], "authors": ["Frank Kr\u00fcger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=ger_0001:Frank", "Alexander Steiniger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steiniger:Alexander", "Sebastian Bader.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bader_0001:Sebastian", "Thomas Kirste.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirste:Thomas"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
