We find that the accuracies drop drastically when automatic segmentation is used. Inspired by the fact that chunking knowledge can potentially improve segmentation, we explore a joint model that performs segmentation, POS-tagging and chunking simultaneously. In addition, to address the sparsity of full chunk features, we employ a semi-supervised method to derive chunk cluster features from large-scale automatically-chunked data. Results show the effectiveness of the joint model with semi-supervised features.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Wuhan University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Wuhan University"], "authors": ["Chen Lyu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyu:Chen", "Yue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yue", "Donghong Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Donghong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
