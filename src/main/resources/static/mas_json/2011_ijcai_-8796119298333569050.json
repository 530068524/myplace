Probabilistic logics that support reasoning with probability distributions, such as ProbLog, use an implicit definition of an interaction rule to combine probabilistic evidence about atoms. In this paper, we show that this interaction rule is an example of a more general class of interactions that can be described by nonmonotonic logics. We furthermore show that such local interactions about the probability of an atom can be described by convolution. The resulting extended probabilistic logic supports nonmonotonic reasoning with probabilistic information.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Arjen Hommersom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hommersom:Arjen", "Peter J.
