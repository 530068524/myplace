This paper presents a novel method to learn to use formulas to solve simple arithmetic word problems. Our system, analyzes each of the sentences to identify the variables and their attributes; and automatically maps this information into a higher level representation. It then uses that representation to recognize the presence of a formula along with its associated variables. An equation is then generated from the formal description of the formula. In the training phase, it learns to score the   pair from the systematically generated higher level representation. It is able to solve 86.07% of the problems in a corpus of standard primary school test questions and beats the state-of-the-art by", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Computing, Info ... hool of (CIDSE)"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Arindam Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Arindam", "Chitta Baral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baral:Chitta"], "pages": -1}
