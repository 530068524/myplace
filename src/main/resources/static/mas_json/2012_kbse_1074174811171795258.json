{"title": "Fast and precise points-to analysis with incremental CFL-reachability summarisation: preliminary experience.", "fields": ["reachability", "abstraction", "context free language", "modular design", "heap"], "abstract": "We describe our preliminary experience in the design and implementation of a points-to analysis for Java, called EMU, that enables developers to perform pointer-related queries in programs undergoing constant changes in IDEs. EMU achieves fast response times by adopting a modular approach to incrementally updating method summaries upon small code changes: the points-to information in a method is summarised indirectly by CFL reachability rather than directly by points-to sets. Thus, the impact of a small code change made in a method is localised, requiring only its affected part to be re-summarised just to reflect the change. EMU achieves precision by being context-sensitive (for both method invocation and heap abstraction) and field-sensitive. Our evaluation shows that EMU can be promisingly deployed in IDEs where the changes are small.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Lei Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Lei", "Yi Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0003:Yi", "Jingling Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Jingling"], "pages": 4}
