{"title": "EnseWing: Creating an Instrumental Ensemble Playing Experience for Children with Limited Music Training.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "multimedia", "music education", "computer science"], "abstract": "While instrumental ensemble playing can benefit children's music education and collaboration skill development, it requires extensive training on music and instruments, which many school children lack. To help children with limited music training experience instrumental ensemble playing, we created EnseWing, an interactive system that offers such an experience. In this paper, we report the design of the EnseWing experience and a two-month field study. Our results show that EnseWing preserves the music and ensemble skills from traditional instrumental ensemble and provides more collaboration opportunities for children.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Boston University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Xiaoxiaoniu Cre ...
