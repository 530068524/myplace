We propose a novel training approach to address this difficulty. Given cheaply-obtained sparse image labelings, we propagate the sparse labels to produce guessed dense labelings. A standard CNN-based segmentation network is trained to mimic these labelings. The label-propagation process is defined via random-walk hitting probabilities, which leads to a differentiable parameterization with uncertainty estimates that are incorporated into our loss. We show that by learning the label-propagator jointly with the segmentation predictor, we are able to effectively learn semantic edges given no direct edge supervision. Experiments also show that training a segmentation network in this way outperforms the naive approach.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Paul Vernaza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vernaza:Paul", "Manmohan Chandraker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandraker:Manmohan"], "pages": 9}
