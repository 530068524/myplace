{"title": "Diagnosing assumption problems in safety-critical products.", "fields": ["correctness", "exploit", "traceability", "life critical system", "completeness"], "abstract": "Problems with the correctness and completeness of environmental assumptions contribute to many accidents in safety-critical systems. The problem is exacerbated when products are modified in new releases or in new products of a product line. In such cases existing sets of environmental assumptions are often carried forward without sufficiently rigorous analysis. This paper describes a new technique that exploits the traceability required by many certifying bodies to reason about the likelihood that environmental assumptions are omitted or incorrectly retained in new products. An analysis of over 150 examples of environmental assumptions in historical systems informs the approach. In an evaluation on three safety-related product lines the approach caught all but one of the assumption-related problems. It also provided clearly defined steps for mitigating the identified issues. The contribution of the work is to arm the safety analyst with useful information for assessing the validity of environmental assumptions for a new product.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["DePaul University", "Iowa State University", "University of Notre Dame", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Mona Rahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahimi:Mona", "Wandi Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Wandi", "Jane Cleland-Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cleland=Huang:Jane", "Robyn R.
