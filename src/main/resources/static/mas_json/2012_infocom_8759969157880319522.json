In this paper we argue that it is necessary to supplement CCN with mechanisms enabling controlled sharing of network bandwidth by concurrent flows. Traffic control is necessary to ensure low latency for conversational and streaming flows and to realize satisfactory bandwidth sharing between elastic flows. These objectives can be realized using \u201cnetwork neutral\u201d traffic controls based on per-flow fair bandwidth sharing. The paper describes necessary CCN mechanisms and discusses the strategies to be implemented by end systems and routers. A simulation-based performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms and and the impact of possible strategies. We describe our experience in implementing some of the mechanisms using the CCNx prototype software.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Orange Labs, France"], "authors": ["Sara Oueslati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oueslati:Sara", "James Roberts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roberts:James", "Nada Sbihi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sbihi:Nada"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
