We consider a very weak assumption on the function, namely that it is locally smooth (in some precise sense) with respect to some semi-metric, around one of its global maxima. Compared to previous works on bandits in general spaces (Kleinberg et al., 2008; Bubeck et al., 2011a) our algorithm does not require the knowledge of this semi-metric. Our algorithm, StoSOO, follows an optimistic strategy to iteratively construct upper confidence bounds over the hierarchical partitions of the function domain to decide which point to sample next. A finite-time analysis of StoSOO shows that it performs almost as well as the best specifically-tuned algorithms even though the local smoothness of the function is not known.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Cambridge", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Michal Valko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valko:Michal", "Alexandra Carpentier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carpentier:Alexandra", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
