{"title": "Improved Approximation for 3-Dimensional Matching via Bounded Pathwidth Local Search.", "fields": ["bin packing problem", "pathwidth", "3 dimensional matching", "special case", "packing problems"], "abstract": "One of the most natural optimization problems is the k-SET PACKING problem, where given a family of sets of size at most k one should select a maximum size subfamily of pairwise disjoint sets. A special case of 3-SET PACKING is the well known 3-DIMENSIONAL MATCHING problem, which is a maximum hypermatching problem in 3-uniform tripartite hypergraphs. Both problems belong to the Karp's list of 21 NP-complete problems. The best known polynomial time approximation ratio for k-SET PACKING is (k + e)/2 and goes back to the work of Hurkens and Schrijver [SIDMA'89], which gives (1.5+e)-approximation for 3-DIMENSIONAL MATCHING. Those results are obtained by a simple local search algorithm, that uses constant size swaps. The main result of this paper is a new approach to local search for k-SET PACKING where only a special type of swaps is considered, which we call swaps of bounded pathwidth. We show that for a fixed value of k one can search the space of r-size swaps of constant pathwidth in c r poly(|F|) time. Moreover we present an analysis proving that a local search maximum with respect to O(log |F|)-size swaps of constant pathwidth yields a polynomial time (k+1+e)/3-approximation algorithm, improving the best known approximation ratio for k-SET PACKING. In particular we improve the approximation ratio for 3-DIMENSIONAL MATCHING from 3/2+e to 4/3+e.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Warsaw"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Marek Cygan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cygan:Marek"], "pages": 10}
