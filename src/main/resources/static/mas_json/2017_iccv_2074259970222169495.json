The idea is that in order to fully utilize the expressive power of the descriptor space, good local feature descriptors should be sufficiently \u201cspread-out\u201d over the space. In this work, we propose a regularization term to maximize the spread in feature descriptor inspired by the property of uniform distribution. We show that the proposed regularization with triplet loss outperforms existing Euclidean distance based descriptor learning techniques by a large margin. As an extension, the proposed regularization technique can also be used to improve image-level deep feature embedding.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Google", "Google", "Columbia University", "Tsinghua University", "Columbia University", "Google", "Columbia University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Xu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xu", "Felix X.
