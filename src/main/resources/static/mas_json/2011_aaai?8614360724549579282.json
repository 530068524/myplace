In this work, we show how this formal approach can be used for plan and planning domain verification and update. While a model checking method can directly be used to perform plan verification, model update techniques can be used to either update an incorrect plan and\\or update a planning domain specification. Well known model update approaches are based on CTL \u2014 a logic which does not take into account the actions. In previous work, we have proposed the alpha-CTL logic, a logic whose semantics is based on actions. Here, we are proposing a model update system based on alpha-CTL which is able to automatically modify a plan M, generating a new plan M' that satisfies phi or, if there is not such a plan, to automatically update the corresponding planning domain.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "University of S\u00e3o Paulo"], "authors": ["Maria Viviane de Menezes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menezes:Maria_Viviane_de", "Leliane Nunes de Barros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barros:Leliane_Nunes_de"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
