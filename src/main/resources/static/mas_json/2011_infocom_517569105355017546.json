Assume that each user requests for the exclusive usage of a number of wireless channels for a certain time interval. The scheduler has to decide whether to grant its exclusive usage an how much will be charged. To possibly serve users with higher priority, preemptions are allowed with penalties. We analytically prove that our protocols are efficient, truthful, and they have asymptotically optimum competitive ratios. Our extensive simulations show that they perform almost optimum: most of our methods can achieve more than 50% of the optimum by offline method.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ping Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ping", "XiaoHua Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:XiaoHua", "Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
