{"title": "On the Gold Standard for Security of Universal Steganography.", "fields": ["steganography", "universality", "computer science", "computer security", "gold standard", "channel", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "While symmetric-key steganography is quite well understood both in the information-theoretic and in the computational setting, many fundamental questions about its public-key counterpart resist persistent attempts to solve them. The computational model for public-key steganography was proposed by von Ahn and Hopper in EUROCRYPT 2004. At TCC 2005, Backes and Cachin gave the first universal public-key stegosystem \u2013 i.e. one that works on all channels \u2013 achieving security against replayable chosen-covertext attacks (ss-rcca) and asked whether security against non-replayable chosen-covertext attacks (ss-cca) is achievable. Later, Hopper (ICALP 2005) provided such a stegosystem for every efficiently sampleable channel, but did not achieve universality. He posed the question whether universality and ss-cca-security can be achieved simultaneously. No progress on this question has been achieved since more than a decade. In our work we solve Hopper\u2019s problem in a somehow complete manner: As our main positive result we design an ss-cca-secure stegosystem that works for every memoryless channel. On the other hand, we prove that this result is the best possible in the context of universal steganography. We provide a family of 0-memoryless channels \u2013 where the already sent documents have only marginal influence on the current distribution \u2013 and prove that no ss-cca-secure steganography for this family exists in the standard non-look-ahead model.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Kiel", "University of L\u00fcbeck"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Sebastian Berndt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berndt:Sebastian", "Maciej Liskiewicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liskiewicz:Maciej"], "pages": 32}
