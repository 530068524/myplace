Previous results bounded the depth to within at least an additive 2. Our sharper bounds match Ajtai's simulation of randomized depth-$d$ circuits by deterministic depth-$(d+2)$ circuits (Ann.~ Pure Appl.~Logic, '83), and provide an example where randomization (provably) buys resources. \\big skip\\emph{Techniques:}To rule out deterministic circuits we combine the switching lemma with an earlier depth-$3$ lower bound by the author (Comp. Complexity 2009). To exhibit randomized circuits we combine recent analyses by Amano (ICALP '09) and Brody and Verb in (FOCS '10) with derandomization. To make these circuits explicit -- which we find important for the main message of this paper -- we construct a new pseudorandom generator for certain combinatorial rectangle tests. Based on expander walks, the generator for example fools tests $A_1 \\times A_2 \\times \\ldots \\times A_{\\lg n}$ for $A_i \\subseteq [n], |A_i| = n/2$ with error $1/n$ and seed length $O(\\lg n)$, improving on the seed length $\\Omega(\\lg n \\lg \\lg n)$ of previous constructions.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Emanuele Viola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viola:Emanuele"], "pages": 10}
