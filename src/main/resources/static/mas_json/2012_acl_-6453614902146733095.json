An SR-TSG is an extension of the conventional TSG model where each nonterminal symbol can be refined (subcategorized) to fit the training data. We aim to provide a unified model where TSG rules and symbol refinement are learned from training data in a fully automatic and consistent fashion. We present a novel probabilistic SR-TSG model based on the hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process to encode backoff smoothing from a fine-grained SR-TSG to simpler CFG rules, and develop an efficient training method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Our SR-TSG parser achieves an F1 score of 92.4% in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) English Penn Treebank parsing task, which is a 7.7 point improvement over a conventional Bayesian TSG parser, and better than state-of-the-art discriminative reranking parsers.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "National Institute of Informatics", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hiroyuki Shindo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shindo:Hiroyuki", "Yusuke Miyao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miyao:Yusuke", "Akinori Fujino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujino:Akinori", "Masaaki Nagata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagata:Masaaki"], "pages": 9}
