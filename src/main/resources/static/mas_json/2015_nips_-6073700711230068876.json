This paper presents max-margin majority voting (M3V) to improve the discriminative ability of majority voting and further presents a Bayesian generalization to incorporate the flexibility of generative methods on modeling noisy observations with worker confusion matrices. We formulate the joint learning as a regularized Bayesian inference problem, where the posterior regularization is derived by maximizing the margin between the aggregated score of a potential true label and that of any alternative label. Our Bayesian model naturally covers the Dawid-Skene estimator and M3V. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods are competitive, often achieving better results than state-of-the-art estimators.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tian Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Tian", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun"], "pages": 9}
