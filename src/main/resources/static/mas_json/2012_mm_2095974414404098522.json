This paper presents a system of converting conventional monocular videos to stereoscopic ones. In this system, an input video is firstly segmented into shots to reduce operations on similar frames. Then, automatic depth estimation and interactive image segmentation are integrated to obtain depth maps and foreground/background segments on selected key frames. Within each video shot, such results are propagated from key frames to non-key frames. Combined with a depth-to-disparity conversion method, the system synthesizes the counterpart (either left or right) view for stereoscopic display by warping the original frame according to disparity maps. For evaluation, we use human labeled depth map as the reference and compute both the mean opinion score (MOS) and Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) to valuate the converted video quality. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed conversion system and methods achieves encouraging performance.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Zhebin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhebin", "Chen Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Chen", "Bo Xin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xin:Bo", "Yizhou Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Yizhou", "Wen Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Wen"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
