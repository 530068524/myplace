{"title": "Jasmin: High-Assurance and High-Speed Cryptography.", "fields": ["compiler correctness", "compiler construction", "memory safety", "functional compiler", "cryptographic primitive"], "abstract": "Jasmin  is a framework for developing high-speed and high-assurance cryptographic software. The framework is structured around the  Jasmin  programming language and its compiler. The language is designed for enhancing portability of programs and for simplifying verification tasks. The compiler is designed to achieve predictability and efficiency of the output code (currently limited to  x64  platforms), and is formally verified in the  Coq  proof assistant. Using the  supercop  framework, we evaluate the  Jasmin  compiler on representative cryptographic routines and conclude that the code generated by the compiler is as efficient as fast, hand-crafted, implementations. Moreover, the framework includes highly automated tools for proving memory safety and constant-time security (for protecting against cache-based timing attacks). We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the verification tools on a large set of cryptographic routines.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Minho", "University of Porto", "IMDEA", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Bacelar Almeida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almeida:Jos=eacute=_Bacelar", "Manuel Barbosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbosa:Manuel", "Gilles Barthe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthe:Gilles", "Arthur Blot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blot:Arthur", "Benjamin Gr\u00e9goire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=eacute=goire:Benjamin", "Vincent Laporte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laporte:Vincent", "Tiago Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:Tiago", "Hugo Pacheco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pacheco_0001:Hugo", "Benedikt Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Benedikt", "Pierre-Yves Strub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strub:Pierre=Yves"], "pages": 17}
