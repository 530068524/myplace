{"title": "Regular and First-Order List Functions.", "fields": ["dynamic logic", "combinatory logic", "function composition", "hybrid logic", "regular expression"], "abstract": "We define two classes of functions, called regular (respectively, first-order) list functions, which manipulate objects such as lists, lists of lists, pairs of lists, lists of pairs of lists, etc. The definition is in the style of regular expressions: the functions are constructed by starting with some basic functions (e.g. projections from pairs, or head and tail operations on lists) and putting them together using four combinators (most importantly, composition of functions). Our main results are that first-order list functions are exactly the same as first-order transductions, under a suitable encoding of the inputs; and the regular list functions are exactly the same as MSO-transductions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warwick", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "authors": ["Mikolaj Bojanczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bojanczyk:Mikolaj", "Laure Daviaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daviaud:Laure", "Shankara Narayanan Krishna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishna:Shankara_Narayanan"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
