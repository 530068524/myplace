{"title": "Reusing Previously Found A* Paths for Fast Goal-Directed Navigation in Dynamic Terrain.", "fields": ["heuristic function", "pseudocode", "terrain", "exploit", "speedup"], "abstract": "Generalized Adaptive A* (GAA*) is an incremental algorithm that replans using A* when solving goal-directed navigation problems in dynamic terrain. Immediately after each A* search, it runs an efficient procedure that updates the heuristic values of states that were just expanded by A*, making them more informed. Those updates allow GAA* to speed up subsequent A* searches. Being based on A*, it is simple to describe and communicate; however, it is outperformed by other incremental algorithms like the state-of-the-art D*Lite algorithm at goal-directed navigation. In this paper we show how GAA* can be modified to exploit more information from a previous search in addition to the updated heuristic function. Specifically, we show how GAA* can be modified to utilize the paths found by a previous A* search. Our algorithm\u2014Multipath Generalized Adaptive A* (MPGAA*)\u2014has the same theoretical properties of GAA* and differs from it by only a few lines of pseudocode. Arguably, MPGAA* is simpler to understand than D*Lite. We evaluate MPGAA* over various realistic dynamic terrain settings, and observed that it generally outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm D*Lite in scenarios resembling outdoor and indoor navigation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Pontifical Catholic University of Chile", "Depto. de Ingen ... cepci\u00f3n, Chile", "Depto. de Ingen ... cepci\u00f3n, Chile"], "authors": ["Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hern=aacute=ndez:Carlos", "Roberto As\u00edn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/As=iacute=n:Roberto", "Jorge A.
