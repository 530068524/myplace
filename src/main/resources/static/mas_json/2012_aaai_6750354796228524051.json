{"title": "Lifted MEU by Weighted Model Counting.", "fields": ["inference", "influence diagram", "probabilistic logic", "decision making models", "variable elimination"], "abstract": "Recent work in the field of probabilistic inference demonstrated the efficiency of weighted model counting (WMC) engines for exact inference in propositional and, very recently, first order models. To date, these methods have not been applied to decision making models, propositional or first order, such as influence diagrams, and Markov decision networks (MDN). In this paper we show how this technique can be applied to such models. First, we show how WMC can be used to solve (propositional) MDNs. Then, we show how this can be extended to handle a first-order model - the Markov Logic Decision Network (MLDN). WMC offers two central benefits: it is a very simple and very efficient technique. This is particularly true for the first-order case, where the WMC approach is simpler conceptually, and, in many cases, more effective computationally than the existing methods for solving MLDNs via first-order variable elimination, or via propositionalization. We demonstrate the above empirically.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Udi Apsel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apsel:Udi", "Ronen I.
