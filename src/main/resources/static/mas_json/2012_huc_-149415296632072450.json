{"title": "Exploring trajectory-driven local geographic topics in foursquare.", "fields": ["trajectory", "data mining", "social network", "check in", "latent dirichlet allocation"], "abstract": "The location based social networking services (LBSNSs) are becoming very popular today. In LBSNSs, such as Foursquare, users can explore their places of interests around their current locations, check in at these places to share their locations with their friends, etc. These check-ins contain rich information and imply human mobility patterns; thus, they can greatly facilitate mining and analysis of local geographic topics driven by users' trajectories. The local geographic topics indicate the potential and intrinsic relations among the locations in accordance with users' trajectories. These relations are useful for users in both location and friend recommendations. In this paper, we focus on exploring the local geographic topics through check-ins in Pittsburgh area in Foursquare. We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to discover the local geographic topics from the checkins. We also compare the local geographic topics on weekdays with those at weekends. Our results show that LDA works well in finding the related places of interests.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Xuelian Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Xuelian", "Lei Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin_0003:Lei", "James Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi:James"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 8}
