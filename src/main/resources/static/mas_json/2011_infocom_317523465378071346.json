In particular, we are interested in recovering sparse vectors representing the properties of the edges from a graph. Unlike existing compressive sensing results, the collective additive measurements we are allowed to take must follow connected paths over the underlying graph. For a sufficiently connected graph with n nodes, it is shown that, using O(k log(n)) path measurements, we are able to recover any k-sparse link vector (with no more than k nonzero elements), even though the measurements have to follow the graph path constraints. We mainly show that the computationally efficient l 1  minimization can provide theoretical guarantees for inferring such k-sparse vectors with O(k log(n)) path measurements from the graph.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Weiyu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Weiyu", "Enrique Mallada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mallada:Enrique", "Ao Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Ao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
