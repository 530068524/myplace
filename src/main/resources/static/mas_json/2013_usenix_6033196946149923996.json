SMR alone does not protect from full crashes, and thus in practice it is employed together with secondary storage to ensure the durability of the data managed by these services. In this work we show that the classical durability enforcing mechanisms - logging, checkpointing, state transfer - can have a high impact on the performance of SMR-based services even if SSDs are used instead of disks. To alleviate this impact, we propose three techniques that can be used in a transparent manner, i.e., without modifying the SMR programming model or requiring extra resources: parallel logging, sequential checkpointing, and collaborative state transfer. We show the benefits of these techniques experimentally by implementing them in an open-source replication library, and evaluating them in the context of a consistent key-value store and a coordination service.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Lisbon", "University of Lisbon", "University of Lisbon", "University of Lisbon", "University of Lisbon"], "authors": ["Alysson Neves Bessani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bessani:Alysson_Neves", "Marcel Santos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santos:Marcel", "Jo\u00e3o Felix.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felix:Jo=atilde=o", "Nuno Ferreira Neves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neves:Nuno_Ferreira", "Miguel Correia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Correia_0001:Miguel"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
