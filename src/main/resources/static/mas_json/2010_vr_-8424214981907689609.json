Natural Interaction is the metaphor people encounter in reality: the direct manipulation of objects by their hands. To enable this kind of Natural Interaction, we propose a pseudo-physical metaphor that is both plausible enough to provide realistic interaction and robust enough to meet the needs of industrial applications. Our analysis of the most common types of objects in typical automotive scenarios guided the development of a set of refined grasping heuristics to support robust finger-based interaction of multiple hands and users. The objects' behavior in reaction to the users' finger motions is based on pseudo-physical simulations, which also take various types of constrained objects into account. In dealing with real-world scenarios, we had to introduce the concept of Normal Proxies, which extend objects with appropriate normals for improved grasp detection and grasp stability. An expert review revealed that our interaction metaphors allow for an intuitive and reliable assessment of several functionalities of objects found in a car interior.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Volkswagen", "Bauhaus University, Weimar"], "authors": ["Mathias Moehring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moehring:Mathias", "Bernd Froehlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Froehlich_0001:Bernd"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
