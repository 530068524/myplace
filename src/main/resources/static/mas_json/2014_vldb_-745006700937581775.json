{"title": "Fast Column Scans: Paged Indices for In-Memory Column Stores.", "fields": ["transactional leadership", "memory bandwidth", "workload", "throughput", "parallel computing"], "abstract": "Commodity hardware is available in configurations with huge amounts of main memory and it is viable to keep large databases of enterprises in the RAM of one or a few machines. Additionally, a reunification of transactional and analytical systems has been proposed to enable operational reporting on the most recent data. In-memory column stores appeared in academia and industry as a solution to handle the resulting mixed workload of transactional and analytical queries. Therein queries are processed by scanning whole columns to evaluate the predicates on non-key columns. This leads to a waste of memory bandwidth and reduced throughput.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam"], "authors": ["Martin Faust.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faust:Martin", "David Schwalb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwalb:David", "Jens Kr\u00fcger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=ger_0003:Jens"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2014", "pages": 13}
