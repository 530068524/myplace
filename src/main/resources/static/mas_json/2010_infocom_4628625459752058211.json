Yet in networks that support differentiation between flows, the congestion experienced by a packet depends on its priority level. Another differentiation is made by compressing the packets in the low priority flow while leaving the high priority flow intact. In this paper we study such kind of routing scenarios for the case of non-atomic users and we establish conditions for the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Avignon", "Indian Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Vijay Kamble.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamble:Vijay", "Eitan Altman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altman:Eitan", "Rachid El Azouzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azouzi:Rachid_El", "Vinod Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Vinod"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
