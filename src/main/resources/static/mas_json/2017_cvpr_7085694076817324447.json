We propose a systematic algorithm for computing universal perturbations, and show that state-of-the-art deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to such perturbations, albeit being quasi-imperceptible to the human eye. We further empirically analyze these universal perturbations and show, in particular, that they generalize very well across neural networks. The surprising existence of universal perturbations reveals important geometric correlations among the high-dimensional decision boundary of classifiers. It further outlines potential security breaches with the existence of single directions in the input space that adversaries can possibly exploit to break a classifier on most natural images.", "citation": "Citations (226)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of California, Los Angeles", "ETH Zurich", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moosavi=Dezfooli:Seyed=Mohsen", "Alhussein Fawzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fawzi:Alhussein", "Omar Fawzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fawzi:Omar", "Pascal Frossard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frossard:Pascal"], "pages": 9}
