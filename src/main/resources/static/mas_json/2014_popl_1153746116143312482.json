This paper shows how to increase expressiveness still further, by adding closed type functions whose equations may overlap, and may have non-linear patterns over an open type universe. Although practically useful and simple to implement, these features go  beyond  conventional dependent type theory in some respects, and have a subtle metatheory.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Richard A.
