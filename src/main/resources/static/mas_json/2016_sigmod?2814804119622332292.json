{"title": "Wildfire: Concurrent Blazing Data Ingest and Analytics.", "fields": ["transactional leadership", "analytics", "internet privacy", "data mining", "sql"], "abstract": "We demonstrate Hybrid Transactional and Analytics Processing (HTAP) on the Spark platform by the Wildfire prototype, which can ingest up to ~6 million inserts per second per node and simultaneously perform complex SQL analytics queries. Here, a simplified mobile application uses Wildfire to recommend advertising to mobile customers based upon their distance from stores and their interest in products sold by these stores, while continuously graphing analytics results as those customers move and respond to the ads with purchases.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ronald Barber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barber:Ronald", "Matt Huras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huras:Matt", "Guy M.
