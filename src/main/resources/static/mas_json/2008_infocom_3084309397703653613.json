{"title": "BAKE: A Balanced Kautz Tree Structure for Peer-to-Peer Networks.", "fields": ["tree structure", "tree", "scalability", "de bruijn sequence", "peer to peer"], "abstract": "In order to improve scalability and reduce maintenance overhead for structured peer-to-peer systems, researchers design optimal architectures with constant degree and logarithmical diameter. The expected topologies, however, require the number of peers to be some given values determined by the average degree and the diameter. Hence, existing designs fail to address the issue due to the fact that (1) we cannot guarantee how many peers to join a P2P system at a given time, and (2) a P2P system is typically dynamic with peers frequently coming and leaving. In this work, we propose BAKE scheme based on balanced Kautz tree structure with  logdn  in diameter and constant degree even the number of peers is an arbitrary value. Resources that are similar in single or multi-dimensional attributes space are stored on a same peer or neighboring peers. Through formal analysis and comprehensive simulations, we show that BAKE achieves optimal diameter and good connectivity as the Kautz digraph does. Indeed, the concepts of balanced Kautz tree introduced in this work can also be extended and applied to other interconnection networks after minimal modifications, for example, de Bruijn digraph.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Department of C ...  and Technology"], "authors": ["Deke Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Deke", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
