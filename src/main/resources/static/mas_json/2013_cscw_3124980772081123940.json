Adding audio narrations to traditional paper photographs combines the familiarity of paper photos with the nuanced richness of voice. We enable creation of and interaction with audio-enhanced paper photographs through custom software deployed on a digital pen. This paper reports on use of a paper-digital photo album by an older adult (Ethel, age 105), her extended family, and nursing staff over a five-month field deployment. The interactive photo album was found to be easy to use and accessible, effectively engaged Ethel's and family members' interest, and provided a focal point for communication and social interaction. Family and caregivers report improvements in Ethel's social interaction. We discuss the properties of our audio-enhanced paper approach that make it a promising medium for engaging older adults and distill general design considerations for paper-digital photo albums.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Anne Marie Piper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piper:Anne_Marie", "Nadir Weibel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weibel:Nadir", "James D.
