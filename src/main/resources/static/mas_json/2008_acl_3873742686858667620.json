Word types in each language are characterized by purely monolingual features, such as context counts and orthographic substrings. Translations are induced using a generative model based on canonical correlation analysis, which explains the monolingual lexicons in terms of latent matchings. We show that high-precision lexicons can be learned in a variety of language pairs and from a range of corpus types.", "citation": "Citations (287)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Aria Haghighi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haghighi:Aria", "Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy", "Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berg=Kirkpatrick:Taylor", "Dan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Dan"], "pages": 9}
