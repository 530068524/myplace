Such systems are typically composed of primary and secondary networks; the configuration of the latter depends on spectrum opportunity unexploited in the former. In this paper we explore the characteristics of the single hop transport throughput (STT) of the secondary network with outage constraints imposed on both networks. STT is a new metric that inherits the merits of both the traditional transport capacity and another popular metric, transmission capacity, incorporating transmission distance and outage probability into a uniform framework. We first derive the limit of STT, single hop transport capacity (STC), together with a practical upper bound for it. Then we investigate STT with secondary receivers randomly located in the field of interest. Three models regarding the selection of receivers are considered: optimally selected, randomly selected, or the nearest. Study on these models provides a comprehensive view of achievable secondary network throughput, and offers insights into the configuration of secondary networks. In addition, the broadcast transport throughput (BTT) of the secondary networks is also investigated as an extension of STT, and its similarity with STT in the nearest neighbor model is revealed.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Chengzhi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chengzhi", "Huaiyu Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Huaiyu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
