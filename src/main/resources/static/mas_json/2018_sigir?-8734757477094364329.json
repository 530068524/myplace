To capture the pair-wise interactions between geo-location and user's topical profile in social-spatial systems, we propose the modeling of fine-grained and multi-dimensional user geo-topic profiles. We then propose a two-layered Bayesian hierarchical user factorization generative framework to overcome user heterogeneity and another enhanced model integrated with user's contextual information to alleviate multi-dimensional sparsity. Through extensive experiments, we find the proposed model leads to a 5\\textasciitilde13% improvement in precision and recall over the alternative baselines and an additional 6\\textasciitilde11% improvement with the integration of user's contexts.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Haokai Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Haokai", "Wei Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Wei", "James Caverlee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caverlee:James"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
