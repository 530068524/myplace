Recently, considerable research efforts have been put into the field of analysing uncertain data. In this paper, we study the problem of processing the uncertain location based range aggregate in a multi-dimensional space. We first formally introduce the problem, then propose a general filtering-and-verification framework to solve the problem. Two filtering techniques, named STF and PCR respectively, are proposed to significantly reduce the verification cost.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Ying Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Ying", "Xuemin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xuemin", "Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei", "Wenjie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wenjie"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
