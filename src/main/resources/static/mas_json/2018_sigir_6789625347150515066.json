Different from other systems, CoNEREL processes articles and comments in batch mode, to make the best use of the shared contexts of multiple news stories and their comments. Particularly, a news article provides context for all its comments. To improve named entity recognition, CoNEREL utilizes co-reference of mentions to refine their class labels ( e.g. , person, location). To link the recognized entities to Wikipedia, our system implements Pair-Linking, a state-of-the-art entity linking algorithm. Furthermore, CoNEREL provides an interactive visualization of the Pair-Linking process. From the visualization, one can understand how Pair-Linking achieves decent linking performance through iterative evidence building, while being extremely fast and efficient. The graph formed by the Pair-Linking process naturally becomes a good summary of entity relations, making CoNEREL a useful tool to study the relationships between the entities mentioned in an article, as well as the ones that are discussed in its comments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Minh C.
