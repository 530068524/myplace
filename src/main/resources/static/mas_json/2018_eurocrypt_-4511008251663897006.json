{"title": "Fiat-Shamir and Correlation Intractability from Strong KDM-Secure Encryption.", "fields": ["obfuscation", "encryption", "exponential function", "random function", "mathematics", "correlation", "soundness", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "A hash function family is called correlation intractable if for all sparse relations, it is hard to find, given a random function from the family, an input-output pair that satisfies the relation (Canetti et al., STOC 1998). Correlation intractability (CI) captures a strong Random-Oracle-like property of hash functions. In particular, when security holds for all sparse relations, CI suffices for guaranteeing the soundness of the Fiat-Shamir transformation from any constant round, statistically sound interactive proof to a non-interactive argument. However, to date, the only CI hash function for all sparse relations (Kalai et al., Crypto 2017) is based on general program obfuscation with exponential hardness properties.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Boston University", "Boston University", "Boston University", "Northeastern University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ran Canetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canetti:Ran", "Yilei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yilei", "Leonid Reyzin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reyzin:Leonid", "Ron D.
