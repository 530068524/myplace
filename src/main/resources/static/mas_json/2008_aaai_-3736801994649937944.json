As an outgrowth of research on the use of nonmonotonic reasoning in knowledge representation, it is particularly useful in knowledge-intensive applications. ASP programs consist of rules that look like Prolog rules, but the computational mechanisms used in ASP are different: they are based on the ideas that have led to the creation of fast satisfiability solvers for propositional logic.", "citation": "Citations (313)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Vladimir Lifschitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lifschitz:Vladimir"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
