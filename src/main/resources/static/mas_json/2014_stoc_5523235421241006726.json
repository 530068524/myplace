Our main result states that even for constant  e , the query complexity of an  e -well-supported Nash equilibrium is exponential in  n .", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yakov Babichenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babichenko:Yakov"], "pages": 10}
