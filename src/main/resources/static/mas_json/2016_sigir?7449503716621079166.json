In particular, there is a a softmax layer for the word sentiment polarity upon the Skip-gram model. Then, two paralleled embedding layers are set up in the same embedding space, one for the affirmative context and the other for the negated context, followed by their loss functions. We evaluate our proposed model on the 2013 and 2014 SemEval data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves better performance and learns higher dimensional word embedding informatively on the large-scale data.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "East China Normal University"], "authors": ["Qinmin Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Qinmin", "Yijun Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Yijun", "Qin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qin", "Liang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Liang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
