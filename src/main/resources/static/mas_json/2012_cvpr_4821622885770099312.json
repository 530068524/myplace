The accurate estimation of human poses from the depth image is universally a critical step. However, existing pose estimation systems exhibit failures when faced severe occlusion. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based method to learn to correct the initially estimated poses. We learn an inhomogeneous systematic bias by leveraging the exemplar information within specific human action domain. Our algorithm is illustrated on both joint-based skeleton correction and tag prediction. In the experiments, significant improvement is observed over the contemporary approaches, including what is delivered by the current Kinect system.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wei Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen_0002:Wei", "Ke Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Ke", "Xiang Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Xiang", "Tommer Leyvand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leyvand:Tommer", "Baining Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Baining", "Zhuowen Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Zhuowen"], "pages": 8}
