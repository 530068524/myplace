The key ingredient was the use of a calculus with useful sharing, a new notion whose complexity was shown to be polynomial, but whose implementation was not explored. This paper, meant to be complementary, studies useful sharing in a call-by-value scenario and from a practical point of view. We introduce the Fireball Calculus, a natural extension of call-by-value to open terms, that is an intermediary step towards the strong case, and we present three results. First, we adapt useful sharing, refining the meta-theory. Then, we introduce the glamour, a simple abstract machine implementing the Fireball Calculus extended with useful sharing. Its key feature is that usefulness of a step is tested -- surprisingly -- in constant time. Third, we provide a further optimisation that leads to an implementation having only a linear overhead with respect to the number of a#x03B2;-steps.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "University of Bologna"], "authors": ["Beniamino Accattoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Accattoli:Beniamino", "Claudio Sacerdoti Coen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coen:Claudio_Sacerdoti"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
