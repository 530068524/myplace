{"title": "Increasing Collocated People\u00bfs Awareness of the Mobile User\u00bfs Activities: a Field Trial of Social Displays.", "fields": ["social relation", "observability", "field trial", "face to face interaction", "mobile device"], "abstract": "Many activities that have traditionally been performed with different dedicated physical artifacts are now done with personal mobile devices. Consequently, the privacy of mobile interfaces has hampered social observability and chances for serendipitous interactions. For example, reading an electronic newspaper with a mobile device does not allow the surrounding people to be similarly aware of the reader\u00e2  s activity as traditional newspapers. Social displays are additional displays on mobile devices providing the surrounding people with light-weight cues about the activities of the device user. We implemented a prototype that reveals the user\u00e2  s current active application and presents its name on an e-ink display on the backside of a mobile device. We conducted a ten-day field trial with 13 participants using the prototype. The results show that the prototype was able to increase awareness of users\u00e2   mobile activities and occasionally triggered interactions with others, without significantly violating the sense of privacy.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology"], "authors": ["Pradthana Jarusriboonchai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jarusriboonchai:Pradthana", "Aris Malapaschas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malapaschas:Aris", "Thomas Olsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olsson_0002:Thomas", "Kaisa V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/V=auml==auml=n=auml=nen:Kaisa"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
