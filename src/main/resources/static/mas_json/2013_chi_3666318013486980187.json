Major outcomes include: employee proposals that addressed diverse individual and organizational needs; high participation rates; extensive inter-departmental collaboration, including the discovery of large numbers of previously unknown collaborators; and the development of goals and motivations based on collective concerns at multiple levels of project groups, communities of practice, and the organization as a whole. We recommend further, comparative research into crowd-funding and other forms of employee-initiated innovations.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Tara Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Tara", "Steve Whittaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittaker:Steve", "Hernan Badenes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badenes:Hernan", "Barton A.
