{"title": "SPBC: leveraging the characteristics of MPI HPC applications for scalable checkpointing.", "fields": ["failure rate", "redundancy", "fault tolerance", "scalability", "parallel computing"], "abstract": "The high failure rate expected for future supercomputers requires the design of new fault tolerant solutions. Most checkpointing protocols are designed to work with any message-passing application but suffer from scalability issues at extreme scale. We take a different approach: We identify a property common to many HPC applications, namely  channel-determinism , and introduce a new partial order relation, called  always-happens-before  relation, between events of such applications. Leveraging these two concepts, we design a protocol that combines an unprecedented set of features. Our protocol called SPBC combines in a hierarchical way coordinated checkpointing and message logging. It is the first protocol that provides failure containment without logging any information reliably apart from process checkpoints, and this, without penalizing recovery performance. Experiments run with a representative set of HPC workloads demonstrate a good performance of our protocol during both, failure-free execution and recovery.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Paris-Sud", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Universit\u00e9 de V ... sailles, France"], "authors": ["Thomas Ropars.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ropars:Thomas", "Tatiana V.
