We formulate this as an optimization problem whose 54-dimensional parameter space represents all possible configurations of two hands, each represented as a kinematic structure with 26 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs). To solve this problem, we employ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), an evolutionary, stochastic optimization method with the objective of finding the two-hands configuration that best explains observations provided by an RGB-D sensor. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first to attempt and achieve the articulated motion tracking of two strongly interacting hands. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with simulated and real world image sequences demonstrate that an accurate and efficient solution of this problem is indeed feasible.", "citation": "Citations (210)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Crete", "University of Crete", "University of Crete"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Iasonas Oikonomidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oikonomidis:Iasonas", "Nikolaos Kyriazis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kyriazis:Nikolaos", "Antonis A.
