Relatively little work has focused on learning representations for clustering. In this paper, we propose Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a method that simultaneously learns feature representations and cluster assignments using deep neural networks. DEC learns a mapping from the data space to a lower-dimensional feature space in which it iteratively optimizes a clustering objective. Our experimental evaluations on image and text corpora show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (164)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Facebook", "University of Washington"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Junyuan Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Junyuan", "Ross B.
