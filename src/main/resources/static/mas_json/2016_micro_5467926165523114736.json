In this work, we compare flexible ISP architectures, using applications written in the Darkroom image processing language. We target two fundamental architecture classes:  programmable in time , as represented by SIMD, and  programmable in space , as typified by coarse grain reconfigurable array architectures (CGRA).   We consider several optimizations on these two base architectures, such as register file partitioning for SIMD, bus based routing and pipelined wires for CGRA, and line buffer variations. After these optimizations on average, CGRA provides 1.6x better energy efficiency and 1.4x better compute density versus a SIMD solution, and 1.4x the energy efficiency and 3.1x the compute density of an FPGA. However the cost of providing general programmability is still high: compared to an ASIC, CGRA has 6x worse energy and area efficiency, and this ratio would be roughly 10x if memory dominated applications were excluded.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Artem Vasilyev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasilyev:Artem", "Nikhil Bhagdikar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhagdikar:Nikhil", "Ardavan Pedram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedram:Ardavan", "Stephen Richardson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Richardson:Stephen", "Shahar Kvatinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kvatinsky:Shahar", "Mark Horowitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horowitz:Mark"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
