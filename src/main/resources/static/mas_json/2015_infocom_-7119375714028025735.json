Different from previous works, 1) we consider a flexible new scheme for mobile UEs to select operation mode individually, under which a mobile UE decides to establish a cellular link (with a BS) or a D2D link (with a neighboring UE) based on the pilot signal strength received from its nearest BS; 2) we allow a mobile UE which is located far from BSs to connect to a nearby BS via another intermediate UE in a two-hop manner. Our results indicate that the developed framework is very helpful for network designers to efficiently determine the optimal network parameters at which the optimum system performance can be achieved. Furthermore, as corroborated by extensive numerical results, enabling the D2D link based two-hop connection can significantly improve the network coverage performance, especially for the low SIR regime.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Xidian University", "Xidian University", "Tohoku University", "Tohoku University", "Xidian University"], "authors": ["Jiajia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jiajia", "Shangwei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shangwei", "Hiroki Nishiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishiyama:Hiroki", "Nei Kato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kato:Nei", "Jun Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
