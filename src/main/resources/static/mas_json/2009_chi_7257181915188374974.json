{"title": "Supporting the social uses of television: sociability heuristics for social tv.", "fields": ["heuristics", "usable", "interactive television", "social television", "usability"], "abstract": "Various social television systems and applications, enabling remote communication and interaction between viewers, are currently in development. Although usability guidelines exist for interactive television to ensure a usable system, there are no sociability guidelines for designing or evaluating the social interaction these systems enable. In this paper we present twelve sociability heuristics for evaluating social TV, based on several user studies with social TV systems.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["David Geerts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geerts:David", "Dirk De Grooff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grooff:Dirk_De"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
