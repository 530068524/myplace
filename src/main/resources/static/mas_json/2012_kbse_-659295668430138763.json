{"title": "A model-driven parser generator with reference resolution support.", "fields": ["glr parser", "ll grammar", "canonical lr parser", "recursive descent parser", "simple lr parser"], "abstract": "ModelCC is a model-based parser generator. Model-based parser generators decouple language specification from language processing. This model-driven approach avoids the limitations imposed by parser generators whose language specifications must conform to specific grammar constraints. Moreover, ModelCC supports reference resolution within the language specification. Therefore, it does not parse just trees but it can also efficiently deal with abstract syntax graphs. These graphs can even include cycles (i.e. they are not constrained to directed acyclic graphs).", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Granada"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Luis Quesada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quesada_0002:Luis"], "pages": 4}
