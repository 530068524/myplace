Inspired by recent works on multi-scale convolutional neural networks (CNN), we propose a deep model which fuses complementary information derived from multiple CNN side outputs. Different from previous methods, the integration is obtained by means of continuous Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). In particular, we propose two different variations, one based on a cascade of multiple CRFs, the other on a unified graphical model. By designing a novel CNN implementation of mean-field updates for continuous CRFs, we show that both proposed models can be regarded as sequential deep networks and that training can be performed end-to-end. Through extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and establish new state of the art results on publicly available datasets.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Trento", "fondazione bruno kessler", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Trento"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0002:Dan", "Elisa Ricci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ricci_0001:Elisa", "Wanli Ouyang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouyang:Wanli", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang", "Nicu Sebe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebe:Nicu"], "pages": 9}
