The manifold regularization improves the standard SIR in two aspects: 1) it encodes the local geometry for SIR and 2) it enables SIR to deal with transductive and semi-supervised learning problems. We prove that the proposed graph Laplacian based regularization is convergent at rate root-n. The projection directions of the regularized SIR are optimized by using a conjugate gradient method on the Grassmann manifold. Experimental results support our theory.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Wei Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Wei", "Dacheng Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Dacheng"], "pages": 9}
