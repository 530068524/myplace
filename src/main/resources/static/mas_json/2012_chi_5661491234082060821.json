To explore the types of conversations that are shared on the community web forum, we conducted a qualitative study. We analyzed 865 forum posts from a community crime web forum from April 2004 to June 2011. We found that residents use the forum to: 1) build relationships by strengthening social ties, 2) discuss ways to take collective action, 3) share information and advice, and 4) regulate the social norms of the neighborhood and the web forum. Results suggest that technologies intended for crime prevention should be designed to support communication and problem-solving discussions amongst residents, as opposed to simply providing information to citizens.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Sheena Lewis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lewis:Sheena", "Dan A.
