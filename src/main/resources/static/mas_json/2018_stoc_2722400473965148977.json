{"title": "On approximating the number of k-cliques in sublinear time.", "fields": ["approximation algorithm", "binary logarithm", "vertex", "sublinear function", "graph"], "abstract": "We study the problem of approximating the number of  k -cliques in a graph when given query access to the graph. We consider the standard query model for general graphs via (1) degree queries, (2) neighbor queries and (3) pair queries. Let  n  denote the number of vertices in the graph,  m  the number of edges, and  C   k   the number of  k -cliques. We design an algorithm that outputs a (1+e)-approximation (with high probability) for  C   k  , whose expected query complexity and running time are  O ( n / C   k   1/ k  + m   k /2 / C   k   )(log n , 1/e, k ).    Hence, the complexity of the algorithm is sublinear in the size of the graph for  C   k   = \u03c9( m   k /2\u22121 ). Furthermore, we prove a lower bound showing that the query complexity of our algorithm is essentially optimal (up to the dependence on log n , 1/e and  k ).    The previous results in this vein are by Feige (SICOMP 06) and by Goldreich and Ron (RSA 08) for edge counting ( k =2) and by Eden et al. (FOCS 2015) for triangle counting ( k =3). Our result matches the complexities of these results.    The previous result by Eden et al. hinges on a certain amortization technique that works only for triangle counting, and does not generalize for larger cliques. We obtain a general algorithm that works for any  k \u2265 3 by designing a procedure that samples each  k -clique incident to a given set  S  of vertices with approximately equal probability. The primary difficulty is in finding cliques incident to purely high-degree vertices, since random sampling within neighbors has a low success probability. This is achieved by an algorithm that samples uniform random high degree vertices and a careful tradeoff between estimating cliques incident purely to high-degree vertices and those that include a low-degree vertex.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Talya Eden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eden:Talya", "Dana Ron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ron:Dana", "C.
