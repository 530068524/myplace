In this work, we address the problem of automatically detecting the target types of a query with respect to a type taxonomy. We propose a supervised learning approach with a rich variety of features. Using a purpose-built test collection, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods by a remarkable margin.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Stavanger", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "University of Stavanger"], "authors": ["Dar\u00edo Garigliotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garigliotti:Dar=iacute=o", "Faegheh Hasibi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasibi:Faegheh", "Krisztian Balog.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balog:Krisztian"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
