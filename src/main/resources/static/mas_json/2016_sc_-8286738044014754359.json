This paper describes the design and evaluation of a robust failure detector, able to maintain and distribute the correct list of alive resources within proven and scalable bounds. The detection and distribution of the fault information follow different overlay topologies that together guarantee minimal disturbance to the applications. A virtual observation ring minimizes the overhead by allowing each node to be observed by another single node, providing an unobtrusive behavior. The propagation stage is using a non-uniform variant of a reliable broadcast over a circulant graph overlay network, and guarantees a logarithmic fault propagation. Extensive simulations, together with experiments on the Titan ORNL supercomputer, show that the algorithm performs extremely well, and exhibits all the desired properties of an Exascale-ready algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee"], "authors": ["George Bosilca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosilca:George", "Aurelien Bouteiller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouteiller:Aurelien", "Amina Guermouche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guermouche:Amina", "Thomas H\u00e9rault.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=eacute=rault:Thomas", "Yves Robert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robert:Yves", "Pierre Sens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sens:Pierre", "Jack J.
