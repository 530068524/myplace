The centralized control architecture presents many new opportunities. Among the network management tasks, measurement is one of the most important and challenging one. Researchers have proposed many solutions to better utilize SDN for network measurement. Among them, how to detect Distributed Denial-of-Services (DDoS) quickly and precisely is a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose methods to detect DDoS attacks leveraging on SDN's flow monitoring capability. Our methods utilize measurement resources available in the whole SDN network to adaptively balance the coverage and granularity of attack detection. Through simulations we demonstrate that our methods can quickly locate potential DDoS victims and attackers by using a constrained number of flow monitoring rules.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University"], "authors": ["Yang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0011:Yang", "Yong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0013:Yong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
