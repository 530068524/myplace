Since trailers are intended to advertise movies, they must show specific symbols such as the title logo and the main theme music. Moreover, it is expected to attract viewers by its visual and audio content. V2T satisfies these two requirements when creating a trailer from the original movie content. First, the title logo and the main theme music are extracted. Second, impressive speech and video segments are extracted by using an affective content analysis technique. Third, all of the extracted components are concatenated into the form of a trailer; to realize this, we propose a method that estimates the affective impact of shot sequences, and introduce an algorithm that arranges a set of shots so as to maximize the affective impact of the sequence. Experiments show that our V2T is more appropriate to trailer generation than conventional techniques.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "NTT Corporation ...
