In this paper, we address these challenging data properties by designing a novel K nearest neighbor based Kalman filter Gaussian process (KNN-KFGP) regression. Based on a state space model established by the KNN driven data grouping, our KNN-KFGP recursively filters out the latent function values in a computationally efficient and accurate Kalman filtering framework. Moreover, KNN allows each test point to find its strongly correlated local training subset, so our KNN-KFGP provides a suitable way to deal with spatial nonstationary problems. We evaluate the performance of our KNN-KFGP on several synthetic and real data sets to show its validity.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Laval University", "Laval University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yali Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yali", "Brahim Chaib-draa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaib=draa:Brahim"], "pages": 7}
