This work studies energy conservation on emerging CPU-GPU hybrid clusters through dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). We aim at minimizing the total energy consumption of processing a sequence of real-time tasks under deadline constraints. We compute the appropriate voltage/frequency setting for each task through mathematical optimization, and assign multiple tasks to the cluster with heuristic scheduling algorithms. In performance evaluation driven by real-world power measurement traces, our scheduling algorithm shows comparable energy savings to the theoretical upper bound. With a GPU scaling interval where analytically at most 38% of energy can be saved, we record 30\u201336% of energy savings. Our results are applicable to energy management on modern heterogeneous clusters. In particular, our model stresses the nonlinear relationship between task execution time and processor speed for GPU-accelerated applications, for more accurately capturing real-world GPU energy consumption.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hang Seng Management College", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Xinxin Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Xinxin", "Xiaowen Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Xiaowen", "Hai Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hai", "Yiu-Wing Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Yiu=Wing", "Zongpeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zongpeng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
