{"title": "Efficient Third-Order Dependency Parsers.", "fields": ["lr parser", "natural language processing", "treebank", "dependency grammar", "parsing"], "abstract": "We present algorithms for higher-order dependency parsing that are \"third-order\" in the sense that they can evaluate substructures containing three dependencies, and \"efficient\" in the sense that they require only O(n4) time. Importantly, our new parsers can utilize both sibling-style and grandchild-style interactions. We evaluate our parsers on the Penn Treebank and Prague Dependency Treebank, achieving unlabeled attachment scores of 93.04% and 87.38%, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (198)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Terry Koo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koo:Terry", "Michael Collins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collins_0001:Michael"], "pages": 11}
