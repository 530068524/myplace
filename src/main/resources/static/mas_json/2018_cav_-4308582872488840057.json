{"title": "A Direct Encoding for NNC Polyhedra.", "fields": ["polyhedron", "theoretical computer science", "discrete mathematics", "slack variable", "encoding"], "abstract": "We present an alternative Double Description representation for the domain of NNC (not necessarily closed) polyhedra, together with the corresponding Chernikova-like conversion procedure. The representation uses no slack variable at all and provides a solution to a few technical issues caused by the encoding of an NNC polyhedron as a closed polyhedron in a higher dimension space. A preliminary experimental evaluation shows that the new conversion algorithm is able to achieve significant efficiency improvements.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Parma", "University of Parma"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Anna Becchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Becchi:Anna", "Enea Zaffanella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaffanella:Enea"], "pages": 19}
