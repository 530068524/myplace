{"title": "Towards reliable spatial information in LBSNs.", "fields": ["computer science", "internet privacy", "honesty", "spatial analysis", "social network"], "abstract": "The proliferation of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) has been rapid during the last year due to the number of novel services they can support. The main interaction between users in an LBSN is location sharing, which builds the spatial component of the system. The majority of the LBSNs make use of the notion of check-in, to enable users to volunteeringly share their whereabouts with their peers and the system. The flow of this spatial information is unidirectional and originates from the users' side. Given that currently there is no infrastructure in place for detecting fake checkins, the quality of the spatial information plane of an LBSN is solely based on the honesty of the users. In this paper, we seek to raise the awareness of the community for this problem, by identifying and discussing the effects of the presence of fake location information. We further present a preliminary design of a fake check-in detection scheme, based on location-proofs. Our initial simulation results show that if we do not consider the infrastructural constraints, location-proofs can form a viable technical solution.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Ke Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ke", "Wei Jeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeng:Wei", "Francis Fofie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fofie:Francis", "Konstantinos Pelechrinis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pelechrinis:Konstantinos", "Prashant Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Prashant"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 6}
