{"title": "Web-Scale N-gram Models for Lexical Disambiguation.", "fields": ["spelling", "pattern recognition", "n gram", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Web-scale data has been used in a diverse range of language research. Most of this research has used web counts for only short, fixed spans of context. We present a unified view of using web counts for lexical disambiguation. Unlike previous approaches, our supervised and unsupervised systems combine information from multiple and overlapping segments of context. On the tasks of preposition selection and context-sensitive spelling correction, the supervised system reduces disambiguation error by 20-24% over the current state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Google", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Shane Bergsma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergsma:Shane", "Dekang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Dekang", "Randy Goebel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goebel:Randy"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
