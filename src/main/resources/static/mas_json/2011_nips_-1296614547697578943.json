This problem arises in several applications where data distributions fluctuate because of biological, technical, or other sources of variation. We develop a distribution-free, kernel-based approach to the problem. This approach involves identifying an appropriate reproducing kernel Hilbert space and optimizing a regularized empirical risk over the space. We present generalization error analysis, describe universal kernels, and establish universal consistency of the proposed methodology. Experimental results on flow cytometry data are presented.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Universit\u00e4t Potsdam"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Gilles Blanchard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanchard:Gilles", "Gyemin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Gyemin", "Clayton Scott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scott:Clayton"], "pages": 9}
