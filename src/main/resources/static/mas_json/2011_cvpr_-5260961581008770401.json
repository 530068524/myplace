A collective activity is defined or reinforced by the existence of coherent behavior of individuals in time and space. We call such coherent behavior \u2018Crowd Context\u2019. Examples of collective activities are \u201cqueuing in a line\u201d or \u201ctalking\u201d. Following [7], we propose to recognize collective activities using the crowd context and introduce a new scheme for learning it automatically. Our scheme is constructed upon a Random Forest structure which randomly samples variable volume spatio-temporal regions to pick the most discriminating attributes for classification. Unlike previous approaches, our algorithm automatically finds the optimal configuration of spatio-temporal bins, over which to sample the evidence, by randomization. This enables a methodology for modeling crowd context. We employ a 3D Markov Random Field to regularize the classification and localize collective activities in the scene. We demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the proposed framework in a number of experiments and show that our method outperforms state-of-the art action classification techniques [7, 19].", "citation": "Citations (188)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wongun Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Wongun", "Khuram Shahid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahid:Khuram", "Silvio Savarese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savarese:Silvio"], "pages": 8}
