All models were created using Bayesian networks, via eliciting knowledge from domain experts, and validated using data from past finished projects. Post-mortem interviews with the participating companies showed that they found the entire process extremely beneficial and worthwhile, and that all the models created remained in use by those companies.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Zayed University"], "authors": ["Emilia Mendes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mendes:Emilia"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
