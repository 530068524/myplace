{"title": "Sampling node pairs over large graphs.", "fields": ["topological graph theory", "homophily", "random walk", "complete graph", "vertex"], "abstract": "Characterizing user pair relationships is important for applications such as friend recommendation and interest targeting in online social networks (OSNs). Due to the large scale nature of such networks, it is infeasible to enumerate all user pairs and so sampling is used. In this paper, we show that it is a great challenge even for OSN service providers to characterize user pair relationships even when they possess the complete graph topology. The reason is that when sampling techniques (i.e., uniform vertex sampling (UVS) and random walk (RW)) are naively applied, they can introduce large biases, in particular, for estimating similarity distribution of user pairs with constraints such as existence of mutual neighbors, which is important for applications such as identifying network homophily. Estimating statistics of user pairs is more challenging in the absence of the complete topology information, since an unbiased sampling technique such as UVS is usually not allowed, and exploring the OSN graph topology is expensive. To address these challenges, we present asymptotically unbiased sampling methods to characterize user pair properties based on UVS and RW techniques respectively. We carry out an evaluation of our methods to show their accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we apply our methods to two Chinese OSNs, Doudan and Xiami, and discover significant homophily is present in these two networks.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Pinghui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Pinghui", "Junzhou Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Junzhou", "John C.
