{"title": "No Small Linear Program Approximates Vertex Cover within a Factor 2 - e.", "fields": ["linear programming relaxation", "edge cover", "feedback vertex set", "unique games conjecture", "vertex cover"], "abstract": "The vertex cover problem is one of the most important and intensively studied combinatorial optimization problems. Khot and Regevproved that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor2 - a#x03B5;, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). This is tight because the problem has an easy 2-approximation algorithm. Without resorting to the UGC, the best in approximability result for the problem is due to Dinur and Safra: vertex cover is NP-hard to approximate within a factor 1.3606. We prove the following unconditional result about linear programming (LP)relaxations of the problem: every LP relaxation that approximates vertex cover within a factor of 2-a#x03B5; has super-polynomially many inequalities. As a direct consequence of our methods, we also establish that LP relaxations (as well as SDP relaxations) that approximate the independent set problem within any constant factor have super-polynomially many inequalities.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Dept. de Math., ... ussels, Belgium"], "authors": ["Abbas Bazzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bazzi:Abbas", "Samuel Fiorini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiorini:Samuel", "Sebastian Pokutta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pokutta:Sebastian", "Ola Svensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svensson:Ola"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
