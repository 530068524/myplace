The method uses query logs from Yahoo! Search and Yahoo! Answers for automatically extracting a corpus of paraphrases of queries and questions using the query-question click history. Elements of this corpus are automatically ranked according to recall and mean reciprocal rank, and then used for learning two independent learning to rank models (SVMRank), whereby a set of new query paraphrases can be scored according to recall and MRR. We perform several automatic evaluation procedures using cross-validation for analyzing the behavior of various aspects of our learned ranking functions, which show that our method is useful and effective for search in cQA.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "DFKI GmbH, Saar ... \u00fccken, Germany"], "authors": ["Alejandro Figueroa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Figueroa_0001:Alejandro", "Guenter Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann:Guenter"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
