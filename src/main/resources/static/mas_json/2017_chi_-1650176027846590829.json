{"title": "Follow-My-Lead: Intuitive Indoor Path Creation and Navigation Using Interactive Videos.", "fields": ["wearable computer", "fidelity", "mobile robot navigation", "scrolling", "mobile computing"], "abstract": "We present Follow-My-Lead, an alternative indoor navigation technique that uses visual information recorded on an actual navigation path as a navigational guide. Its design revealed a trade-off between the fidelity of information provided to users and their effort to acquire it. Our first experiment revealed that scrolling through a continuous image stream of the navigation path is highly informative, but it becomes tedious with constant use. Discrete image checkpoints require less effort, but can be confusing. A balance may be struck by adding fast video transitions between image checkpoints, but precise control is required to handle difficult situations. Authoring still image checkpoints is also difficult, and this inspired us to invent a new technique using video checkpoints. We conducted a second experiment on authoring and navigation performance and found video checkpoints plus fast video transitions to be better than both image checkpoints plus fast video transitions and traditional written instructions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Yale University", "National University of Singapore", "Singapore Management University", "Act8 Design Pte ... pore, Singapore"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Quentin Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Quentin", "Simon T.
