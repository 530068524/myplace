In other words, for decades, the poor RD performance and the high coding delay hinder WZ codecs from being applied to practical applications. To respond to the above challenges, an effective and efficient WZ video coding architecture, referred to herein as \"Improved Side Information and Parallelized Design\" (ISIPaD) for distributed video coding (DVC), is proposed and realized to enhance the RD performance and the execution speed at the same time. This work details the proposed coding scheme and shows its RD superiority over the related works. With much enhanced performances in both rate distortion (up to 3.6dB in RD measures) and execution time (60.97 times faster in speed), as compared with those of the state-of-the-art WZ video codecs, our work demonstrates a great potential for DVC being applied to real applications in the near future.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Yun-Chung Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yun=Chung"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
