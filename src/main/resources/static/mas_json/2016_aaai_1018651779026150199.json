This paper introduces two heuristics and develops two local search algorithms for MWCP. Firstly, we propose a heuristic called strong configuration checking (SCC), which is a new variant of a recent powerful strategy called configuration checking (CC) for reducing cycling in local search. Based on the SCC strategy, we develop a local search algorithm named LSCC. Moreover, to improve the performance on massive graphs, we apply a low-complexity heuristic called Best from Multiple Selection (BMS) to select the swapping vertex pair quickly and effectively. The BMS heuristic is used to improve LSCC, resulting in the LSCC+BMS algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art local search algorithm MN/TS and its improved version MN/TS+BMS on the standard benchmarks namely DIMACS and BHOSLIB, as well as a wide range of real world massive graphs.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Northeast Normal University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Northeast Normal University"], "authors": ["Yiyuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yiyuan", "Shaowei Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Shaowei", "Minghao Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Minghao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
