While the techniques used to developed personas and their integration with other design activities provide some measure of validity, a persona's legitimacy can be threatened by challenging its characteristics. This note presents Persona Cases: personas whose characteristics are both grounded in, and traceable to their originating source of empirical data. This approach builds on the premise that sense-making in qualitative data analysis is an argumentative activity, and aligns concepts associated with a Grounded Theory analysis with recent work on arguing the characteristics of personas. We illustrate this approach using a case study in the Critical Infrastructure Protection domain.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Shamal Faily.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faily:Shamal", "Ivan Flechais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flechais:Ivan"], "pages": 4}
