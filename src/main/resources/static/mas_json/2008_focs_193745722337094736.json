{"title": "Rounding Parallel Repetitions of Unique Games.", "fields": ["rounding", "counterexample", "conjecture", "special case", "alphabet"], "abstract": "We show a connection between the semidefinite relaxation of unique games and their behavior under parallel repetition. Specifically,denoting by val(G) the value of a two-prover unique game G, andby sdpval(G) the value of a natural semidefinite program to approximate val(G), we prove that for every l epsi N, if sdpval(G) ges 1-delta, then val(G l ) ges 1-radicsldelta. Here, G l  denotes the l-fold parallel repetition of G, and s=O(log(k/delta)), where k denotes the alphabet size of the game. For the special case where G is an XOR game (i.e., k=2), we obtain the same bound but with s as an absolute constant. Our bounds on s are optimal up to a factor of O(log(1/delta)). For games with a significant gap between the quantities val(G) and sdpval(G), our result implies that val(G l ) may be much larger than val(G) l , giving a counterexample to the strong parallel repetition conjecture. In a recent breakthrough, Raz (FOCS'08) has shown such an example using the max-cut game on oddcycles. Our results are based on a generalization of his techniques.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Institute for Advanced Studies"], "authors": ["Boaz Barak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barak:Boaz", "Moritz Hardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardt:Moritz", "Ishay Haviv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haviv:Ishay", "Anup Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Anup", "Oded Regev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regev_0001:Oded", "David Steurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steurer:David"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
