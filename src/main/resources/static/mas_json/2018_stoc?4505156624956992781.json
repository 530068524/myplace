We also show that an approximate version of this problem is polynomial-time equivalent to Necklace Splitting, which establishes PPAD-hardness for Necklace Splitting and suggests that it is also PPA-Complete.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Aris Filos-Ratsikas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filos=Ratsikas:Aris", "Paul W.
