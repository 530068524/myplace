{"title": "Weakly Supervised Learning of Image Partitioning Using Decision Trees with Structured Split Criteria.", "fields": ["information fuzzy networks", "decision tree learning", "incremental decision tree", "alternating decision tree", "id3 algorithm"], "abstract": "We propose a scheme that allows to partition an image into a previously unknown number of segments, using only minimal supervision in terms of a few must-link and cannot-link annotations. We make no use of regional data terms, learning instead what constitutes a likely boundary between segments. Since boundaries are only implicitly specified through cannot-link constraints, this is a hard and nonconvex latent variable problem. We address this problem in a greedy fashion using a randomized decision tree on features associated with interpixel edges. We use a it structured purity criterion during tree construction and also show how a backtracking strategy can be used to prevent the greedy search from ending up in poor local optima. The proposed strategy is compared with prior art on natural images.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Christoph N.
