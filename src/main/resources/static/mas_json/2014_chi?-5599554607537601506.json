{"title": "Effects of implicit sharing in collaborative analysis.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "knowledge management", "sensemaking", "culprit", "simulation"], "abstract": "When crime analysts collaborate to solve crime cases, they need to share insights in order to connect the clues, identify a pattern, and attribute the crime to the right culprit. We designed a collaborative analysis tool to explore the value of implicitly sharing insights and notes, without requiring analysts to explicitly push information or request it from each other. In an experiment, pairs of remote individuals played the role of crime analysts solving a set of serial killer crimes with both partners having some, but not all, relevant clues. When implicit sharing of notes was available, participants remembered more clues related to detecting the serial killer, and they perceived the tool as more useful compared to when implicit sharing was not available.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Nitesh Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Nitesh", "Gilly Leshed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leshed:Gilly", "Dan Cosley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosley:Dan", "Susan R.
