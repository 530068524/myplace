{"title": "Rethinking the smart closet as an opportunity to enhance the social currency of clothing.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "social currency", "clothing", "novelty", "closet"], "abstract": "Here we present findings of a needs validation study of 18-25 year old women and their wardrobes. Based on their feedback, we developed a prototype system that allows for borrowing and sharing of information about clothing via Facebook. The novelty of our interface lies in its combining RFID tags and social networking. In doing so we bridge the material and virtual realms and demonstrate the importance of material culture for ubiquitous computing.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "authors": ["Jennifer A.
