MMHP is able to model the dynamics of multiple sequences jointly by imposing structural constraints and thus systematically uncover clustering structure among sequences. We propose an effective and robust optimization algorithm to learn MMHP models, which takes advantage of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), majorization minimization and Euler-Lagrange equations. Our experimental results demonstrate that MMHP performs well on both synthetic and real data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Dixin Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Dixin", "Hongteng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Hongteng", "Yi Zhen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhen:Yi", "Xia Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Xia", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan", "Xiaokang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiaokang", "Wenjun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Wenjun"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
