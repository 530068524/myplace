{"title": "Human Compensation Strategies for Orientation Drifts.", "fields": ["tracking system", "computer vision", "aircraft principal axes", "inertial measurement unit", "accelerometer"], "abstract": "No-Pose (NP) tracking systems rely on a single sensor located at the user's head to determine the position of the head. They estimate the head orientation with inertial sensors and analyze the body motion to compensate their drift. However with orientation drift, VR users implicitly lean their heads and bodies sidewards. Hence, to determine the sensor drift and to explicitly adjust the orientation of the VR display there is a need to understand and consider both the user's head and body orientations. This paper studies the effects of head orientation drift around the yaw axis on the user's absolute head and body orientations when walking naturally in the VR. We study how much drift accumulates over time, how a user experiences and tolerates it, and how a user applies strategies to compensate for larger drifts.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"], "authors": ["Tobias Feigl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feigl:Tobias", "Christopher Mutschler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mutschler:Christopher", "Michael Philippsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Philippsen:Michael"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
