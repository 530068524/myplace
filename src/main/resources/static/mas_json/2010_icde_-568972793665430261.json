The GRN modeling framework extends existing graphical models of probabilistic databases and is capable of representing a much wider range of dependence structures.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa"], "authors": ["Ruiwen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ruiwen", "Yongyi Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Yongyi", "Iluju Kiringa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiringa:Iluju"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
