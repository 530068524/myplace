{"title": "Logical Clustering and Learning for Time-Series Data.", "fields": ["consensus clustering", "logical data model", "fuzzy clustering", "brown clustering", "conceptual clustering"], "abstract": "In order to effectively analyze and build cyberphysical systems (CPS), designers today have to combat the data deluge problem, i.e., the burden of processing intractably large amounts of data produced by complex models and experiments. In this work, we utilize monotonic parametric signal temporal logic (PSTL) to design features for unsupervised classification of time series data. This enables using off-the-shelf machine learning tools to automatically cluster similar traces with respect to a given PSTL formula. We demonstrate how this technique produces interpretable formulas that are amenable to analysis and understanding using a few representative examples. We illustrate this with case studies related to automotive engine testing, highway traffic analysis, and auto-grading massively open online courses.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Toyota", "Toyota", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Marcell Vazquez-Chanlatte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vazquez=Chanlatte:Marcell", "Jyotirmoy V.
