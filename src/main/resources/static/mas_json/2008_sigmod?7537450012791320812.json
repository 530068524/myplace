{"title": "Helping satisfy multiple objectives during a service desk conversation.", "fields": ["service desk", "cost of operation", "preference elicitation", "conversation", "dialog box"], "abstract": "Agents manning a service desk have the unenviable task of satisfying multiple conflicting objectives. Specifically, businesses require the agents to meet pre-specified customer satisfaction levels while keeping the cost of operations low or meeting sales targets, objectives that end up being complementary. Additional complexity is introduced by the fact that the objectives are often  inter-dependent  and have to be met in real-time. Moreover, business might change the objectives from time to time e.g. from reducing cost of operation to increasing sales of slow moving product. In this paper, we describe  CallAssist  - a speech enabled real-time dialog management system that dynamically helps agents in building a conversation that meets the various business objectives while satisfying customer requirements. An added benefit of our solution is the ability to adapt to changing business needs without incurring agent re-training costs. We provide evaluation results displaying the efficiency and effectiveness of our system.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "Arizona State University", "IBM"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ullas Nambiar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nambiar:Ullas", "Himanshu Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Himanshu", "Raju Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Raju", "Mukesh K.
