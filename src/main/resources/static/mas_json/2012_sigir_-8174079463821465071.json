We concentrate on online news agents, and present a semi-supervised method for predicting news articles that a user will visit after reading an initial article. Our method tackles the problem using language intent models trained on historical data which can cope with unseen articles. We evaluate our method on a large set of articles and in several experimental settings. Our results demonstrate the utility of language intent models for predicting user browsing behavior within online news sites.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Manos Tsagkias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsagkias:Manos", "Roi Blanco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanco:Roi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
