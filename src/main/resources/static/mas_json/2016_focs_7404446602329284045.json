Inf. Theory, 2005). The problem is motivated by the large current gap between the regime when it is NP-hard, and the regime when it is efficiently solvable (i.e., the Johnson radius). We show the first NP-hardness results for asymptotically smaller decoding radii than the maximum likelihood decoding radius of Guruswami and Vardy. Specifically, for Reed-Solomon codes of length N and dimension K = O(N), we show that it is NP-hard to decode more than N-K-O/log N log log N) errors. Moreover, we show that the problem is NP-hard under quasipolynomial-time reductions for an error amount > N-K-c log N (with c > 0 an absolute constant). An alternative natural reformulation of the Bounded Distance Decoding problem for Reed-Solomon codes is as a Polynomial Reconstruction problem. In this view, our results show that it is NP-hard to decide whether there exists a degree K polynomial passing through K + O/log N log log N) points from a given set of points (a1, b1), (a2, b2) \u2026, (aN, bN). Furthermore, it is NP-hard under quasipolynomial-time reductions to decide whether there is a degree K polynomial passing through K + c logN many points (with c > 0 an absolute constant). These results follow from the NP-hardness of a generalization of the classical Subset Sum problem to higher moments, called Moments Subset Sum, which has been a known open problem, and which may be of independent interest. We further reveal a strong connection with the well-studied Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem in Number Theory, which turns out to capture a main barrier in extending our techniques. We believe the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem deserves further study in the theoretical computer science community.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Purdue University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Venkata Gandikota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gandikota:Venkata", "Badih Ghazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghazi:Badih", "Elena Grigorescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grigorescu:Elena"], "pages": 10}
