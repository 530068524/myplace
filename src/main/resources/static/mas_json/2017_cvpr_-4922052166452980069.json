In this paper, we present a recurrent video encoding scheme which can discover and leverage the hierarchical structure of the video. Unlike the classical encoder-decoder approach, in which a video is encoded continuously by a recurrent layer, we propose a novel LSTM cell which can identify discontinuity points between frames or segments and modify the temporal connections of the encoding layer accordingly. We evaluate our approach on three large-scale datasets: the Montreal Video Annotation dataset, the MPII Movie Description dataset and the Microsoft Video Description Corpus. Experiments show that our approach can discover appropriate hierarchical representations of input videos and improve the state of the art results on movie description datasets.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Lorenzo Baraldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baraldi:Lorenzo", "Costantino Grana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grana:Costantino", "Rita Cucchiara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cucchiara:Rita"], "pages": 10}
