{"title": "BGP security in partial deployment: is the juice worth the squeeze?", "fields": ["operator", "authentication", "software deployment", "computer security", "default free zone"], "abstract": "As the rollout of secure route origin authentication with the RPKI slowly gains traction among network operators, there is a push to standardize secure path validation for BGP ( i.e.,  S*BGP: S-BGP, soBGP, BGPSEC, etc.). Origin authentication already does much to improve routing security. Moreover, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be long and slow, with S*BGP coexisting in \"partial deployment\" alongside BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and experimental approach to study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already provided by origin authentication. Because routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey of 100 network operators to find the policies that are likely to be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We find that S*BGP provides only meagre benefits over origin authentication when these popular policies are used. We also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Boston University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Robert Lychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lychev:Robert", "Sharon Goldberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldberg:Sharon", "Michael Schapira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schapira:Michael"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
