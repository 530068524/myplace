In short, RAPPORs allow the forest of client data to be studied, without permitting the possibility of looking at individual trees. By applying randomized response in a novel manner, RAPPOR provides the mechanisms for such collection as well as for efficient, high-utility analysis of the collected data. In particular, RAPPOR permits statistics to be collected on the population of client-side strings with strong privacy guarantees for each client, and without linkability of their reports. This paper describes and motivates RAPPOR, details its differential-privacy and utility guarantees, discusses its practical deployment and properties in the face of different attack models, and, finally, gives results of its application to both synthetic and real-world data.", "citation": "Citations (288)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["\u00dalfar Erlingsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erlingsson:=Uacute=lfar", "Vasyl Pihur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pihur:Vasyl", "Aleksandra Korolova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korolova:Aleksandra"], "pages": 14}
