Given a group Q of M query objects, it retrieves the most (or top-k) similar object to Q from a database P, where the similarity is an aggregation (e.g., sum, max) of the distances between the retrieved object p and all the objects in Q. In this paper, we propose an added flexibility to the query definition, where the similarity is an aggregation over the distances between p and any subset of AEM objects in Q for some support 0", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Florida State University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Florida State University", "Hewlett-Packard"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang", "Feifei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Feifei", "Ke Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Ke", "Bin Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao_0002:Bin", "Min Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Min"], "pages": 12}
