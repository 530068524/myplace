We present a multi-faceted exploration to influence placement in extreme-scale systems, to improve network performance and decrease variability. In our first exploration, Scores, we developed a machine learning model that extracts features from a job's node-allocation and grades performance. This identified several important node-metrics that led to Dual-Ended scheduling, a means of reducing network contention without impacting utilization. In evaluations on the Titan supercomputer, we observed reductions in average hop-count by up to 50%. We also developed an improved node-layout strategy that targets a better balance between network latency and bandwidth, replacing the default ALPS layout on Titan that resulted in an average of 10% runtime improvement. Both of these efforts underscore the importance of a job placement strategy that is cognizant of workload mixture and network topology.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "United States Naval Academy"], "authors": ["Christopher Zimmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmer:Christopher", "Saurabh Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Saurabh", "Scott Atchley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atchley:Scott", "Sudharshan S.
