In this demonstration, we aim to detect such hidden query intents, which we define as the frequent phrases that users co-ask with the query term, by exploring query logs. Toward building an online search system  AIDE , we offer users the function to detect  general  and  unique  intents using arbitrary ad-hoc queries at run time. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of the system which achieves indexing and searching over 14M MSN query log records.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "National Tsing Hua University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "National Tsing Hua University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yunliang Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yunliang", "Hui-Ting Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Hui=Ting", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kevin_Chen=Chuan", "Yi-Shin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yi=Shin"], "pages": 4}
