{"title": "Advancements in Reordering Models for Statistical Machine Translation.", "fields": ["bleu", "machine translation", "sequence labeling", "nist", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel reordering model based on sequence labeling techniques. Our model converts the reordering problem into a sequence labeling problem, i.e. a tagging task. Results on five Chinese-English NIST tasks show that our model improves the baseline system by 1.32 BLEU and 1.53 TER on average. Results of comparative study with other seven widely used reordering models will also be reported.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Minwei Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Minwei", "Jan-Thorsten Peter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peter:Jan=Thorsten", "Hermann Ney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ney:Hermann"], "pages": 11}
