We present a reduction that can transform standard low-regret algorithms to strongly adaptive. As a consequence, we derive simple, yet efficient, strongly adaptive algorithms for a handful of problems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Amit Daniely.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daniely:Amit", "Alon Gonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonen:Alon", "Shai Shalev-Shwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalev=Shwartz:Shai"], "pages": 7}
