However, in practice concrete refactoring needs may deviate from what has been distilled as a named refactoring, and mapping these needs to a series of such refactorings \u2014 if at all possible \u2014 can be difficult. To address this, we propose a framework of specifying refactorings in an ad hoc fashion, and demonstrate its feasibility by presenting an implementation. Evaluation is done by simulating application through a user on a set of given sample programs. Results suggest that our proposal of ad hoc refactoring is, for the investigated scenarios at least, viable.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Rolf C.
