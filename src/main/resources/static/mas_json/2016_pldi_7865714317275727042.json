{"title": "Types from data: making structured data first-class citizens in F#.", "fields": ["python", "cache", "javascript", "metaprogramming", "hummingbird"], "abstract": "Dynamic languages such as Ruby, Python, and JavaScript have many compelling benefits, but the lack of static types means subtle errors can remain latent in code for a long time. While many researchers have developed various systems to bring some of the benefits of static types to dynamic languages, prior approaches have trouble dealing with metaprogramming, which generates code as the program executes. In this paper, we propose Hummingbird, a new system that uses a novel technique, just-in-time static type checking, to type check Ruby code even in the presence of metaprogramming. In Hummingbird, method type signatures are gathered dynamically at run-time, as those methods are created. When a method is called, Hummingbird statically type checks the method body against current type signatures. Thus, Hummingbird provides thorough static checks on a per-method basis, while also allowing arbitrarily complex metaprogramming. For performance, Hummingbird memoizes the static type checking pass, invalidating cached checks only if necessary. We formalize Hummingbird using a core, Ruby-like language and prove it sound. To evaluate Hummingbird, we applied it to six apps, including three that use Ruby on Rails, a powerful framework that relies heavily on metaprogramming. We found that all apps typecheck successfully using Hummingbird, and that Hummingbird's performance overhead is reasonable. We applied Hummingbird to earlier versions of one Rails app and found several type errors that had been introduced and then fixed. Lastly, we demonstrate using Hummingbird in Rails development mode to typecheck an app as live updates are applied to it.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Tomas Petricek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petricek_0001:Tomas", "Gustavo Guerra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerra:Gustavo", "Don Syme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Syme:Don"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
