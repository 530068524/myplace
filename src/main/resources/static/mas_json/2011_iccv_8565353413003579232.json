Unlike most of the existing works, which are based on minimizing a point-wise correspondence term, we propose to describe the model set by means of an implicit representation. It allows a new definition of the registration error, which works beyond the point level representation. Moreover, it could be used in a gradient-based optimization framework. The proposed approach consists of two stages. Firstly, a novel formulation is proposed that relates the registration parameters with the distance between the model and data set. Secondly, the registration parameters are obtained by means of the Levengberg-Marquardt algorithm. Experimental results and comparisons with state of the art show the validity of the proposed framework.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Computer Vision ... arcelona, Spain", "Computer Vision ... arcelona, Spain"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Mohammad Rouhani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rouhani:Mohammad", "Angel Domingo Sappa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sappa:Angel_Domingo"], "pages": 8}
