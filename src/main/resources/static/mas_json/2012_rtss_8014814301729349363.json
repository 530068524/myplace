{"title": "Curbing Aggregate Member Flow Burstiness to Bound End-to-End Delay in Networks of TDMA Crossbar Real-Time Switches.", "fields": ["burstiness", "crossbar switch", "time division multiple access", "end to end delay", "scalability"], "abstract": "To integrate the nowadays rapidly expanding distributed real-time systems, we need multi-hop real-time switched networks. A (if not \"the\") widely recognized/adopted real-time switch architecture is the TDMA crossbar real-time (TCRT) switch architecture. However, the original TCRT switch architecture assumes per-flow queueing. To support scalability, however, queue sharing (i.e. flow aggregation), must be allowed. With simple flow aggregation, flow burstiness can grow and infect, making schedulability and end-to-end delay bound analysis an open problem. To deal with this, we propose the real-time aggregate scheme. The scheme complies with the existing TCRT switch architecture, and deploys spatial-temporal isolation and over-provisioning to curb aggregate member flows' burstiness. This allows us to derive the closed-form end-to-end delay bound, and give the corresponding resource planning and admission control strategies. Simulations are carried out to show the effectiveness of the design.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Houston", "McGill University", "Dept. of Comput ... ong Kong, China", "Dept. of Comput ... ong Kong, China"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Qixin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qixin", "Yufei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yufei", "Rong Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Rong", "Xue Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Xue"], "pages": 12}
