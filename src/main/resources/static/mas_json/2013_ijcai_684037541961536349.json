Variable elimination in the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be used in preprocessing or during search to reduce search space size. We show that there are essentially just four variable elimination rules defined by forbidding generic sub-instances, known as irreducible patterns, in arc-consistent CSP instances. One of these rules is the Broken Triangle Property, whereas the other three are novel.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Royal Holloway, University of London", "University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "University of Warwick"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["David A.
