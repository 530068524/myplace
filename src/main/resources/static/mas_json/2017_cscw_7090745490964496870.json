{"title": "When the Internet Goes Down in Bangladesh.", "fields": ["internet access", "censorship", "digital divide", "workaround", "situated"], "abstract": "We present a study of internet use and its forced non-use in Bangladesh. In light of current initiatives by state and industry actors to improve internet access and bridge the 'digital divide' for under-served, under-resourced, and underrepresented communities across the world, we offer a situated, qualitative perspective on what the current state of internet use looks like for select social groups in Bangladesh. We analyze how a state-imposed ban attempted to affect the nonuse of particular web-based services and how the affected populations found or did not find workarounds in response. We also discuss takeaways for researchers as well as industry and state actors studying and working towards more equitable access to the internet in the 'developing' world.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Cornell University", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mehrab Bin Morshed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morshed:Mehrab_Bin", "Michaelanne Dye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dye:Michaelanne", "Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Syed_Ishtiaque", "Neha Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Neha"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
