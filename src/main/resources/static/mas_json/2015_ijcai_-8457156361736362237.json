{"title": "Positive, Negative, or Neutral: Learning an Expanded Opinion Lexicon from Emoticon-Annotated Tweets.", "fields": ["emoticon", "probability distribution", "lexicon", "streams", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present a supervised framework for expanding an opinion lexicon for tweets. The lexicon contains part-of-speech (POS) disambiguated entries with a three-dimensional probability distribution for positive, negative, and neutral polarities. To obtain this distribution using machine learning, we propose word-level attributes based on POS tags and information calculated from streams of emoticon-annotated tweets. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms the three-dimensional word-level polarity classification performance obtained by semantic orientation, a state-of-the-art measure for establishing world-level sentiment.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Waikato", "University of Waikato", "University of Waikato"], "authors": ["Felipe Bravo-Marquez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bravo=Marquez:Felipe", "Eibe Frank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frank:Eibe", "Bernhard Pfahringer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfahringer:Bernhard"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
