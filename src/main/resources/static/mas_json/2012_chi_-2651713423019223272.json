In this paper, we describe the development and validation of an online gaming motivations scale based on a 3-factor model. Data from 2,071 US participants and 645 Hong Kong and Taiwan participants is used to provide a cross-cultural validation of the developed scale. Analysis of actual in-game behavioral metrics is also provided to demonstrate predictive validity of the scale.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "departments": ["PARC", "PARC", "PARC"], "authors": ["Nick Yee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yee:Nick", "Nicolas Ducheneaut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ducheneaut:Nicolas", "Les Nelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nelson:Les"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
