{"title": "Better Termination Proving through Cooperation.", "fields": ["invariant", "computer science", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "One of the difficulties of proving program termination is managing the subtle interplay between the finding of a termination argument and the finding of the argument's supporting invariant. In this paper we propose a new mechanism that facilitates better cooperation between these two types of reasoning. In an experimental evaluation we find that our new method leads to dramatic performance improvements.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Marc Brockschmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brockschmidt:Marc", "Byron Cook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cook:Byron", "Carsten Fuhs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuhs:Carsten"], "pages": 17}
