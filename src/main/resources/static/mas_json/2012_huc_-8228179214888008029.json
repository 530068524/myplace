The use of ambient intelligence, such as smart homes, is a way to provide assistance services. However, managing these services is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose an organizational centered multi-agent system (OCMAS) architecture in order to manage these services in a smart home. This approach allows to ease the management of services and the deployment of new services in the smart home system dynamically.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["LSIIT, P\u00f4le API ... h Cedex, France", "LSIIT, P\u00f4le API ... h Cedex, France", "LSIIT, P\u00f4le API ... h Cedex, France", "LSIIT, P\u00f4le API ... h Cedex, France", "LSIIT, P\u00f4le API ... h Cedex, France"], "authors": ["Patrice Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Patrice", "Nicolas Lachiche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lachiche:Nicolas", "Pierre Gan\u00e7arski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan=ccedil=arski:Pierre", "Alban Meffre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meffre:Alban", "Christophe Collet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collet_0001:Christophe"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
