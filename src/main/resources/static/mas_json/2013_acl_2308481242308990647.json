This paper aims to infer the sentiment similarity between word pairs with respect to their senses. To achieve this aim, we propose a probabilistic emotionbased approach that is built on a hidden emotional model. The model aims to predict a vector of basic human emotions for each sense of the words. The resultant emotional vectors are then employed to infer the sentiment similarity of word pairs. We apply the proposed approach to address two main NLP tasks, namely, Indirect yes/no Question Answer Pairs inference and Sentiment Orientation prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "East China Normal University", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mitra Mohtarami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohtarami:Mitra", "Man Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Man", "Chew Lim Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chew_Lim"], "pages": 10}
