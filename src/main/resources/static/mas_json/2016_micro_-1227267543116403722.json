{"title": "GRAPE: Minimizing energy for GPU applications with performance requirements.", "fields": ["energy consumption", "network functions virtualization", "wavefront", "vhdl", "constrained optimization"], "abstract": "Many applications have performance requirements ( e.g. , real-time deadlines or quality-of-service goals) and we can save tremendous energy by tailoring resource usage so the application just meets its performance using the minimal resources. This problem is a classic constrained optimization: the performance goal is the constraint and energy consumption is the objective to be optimized. While several existing hardware approaches solve unconstrained optimizations ( i.e. , maximizing performance or minimizing energy), we are not aware of a hardware approach that minimizes GPU energy under an externally defined performance constraint. Therefore, we propose GRAPE, a hardware control system for GPUs that coordinates core usage, wavefront/warp action, core speed, and memory speed to deliver user-specified performance while minimizing energy. We implement GRAPE in VHDL (to demonstrate feasibility) and as an extension to GPGPU-Sim (for performance and power measurement). We find that GRAPE can be implemented with very low hardware overhead; however, compared to the no-overhead approach of race-to-idle, GRAPE reduces energy by 9--26% (depending on the performance goal), while meeting performance goals with an average error of 0.75%.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["Muhammad Husni Santriaji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santriaji:Muhammad_Husni", "Henry Hoffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoffmann:Henry"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
