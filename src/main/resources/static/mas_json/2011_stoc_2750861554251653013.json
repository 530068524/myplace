Our protocol also satisfies the stronger notions of concurrent non-malleability and robustness. As a corollary, we establish that constant-round non-malleable zero-knowledge arguments for NP can be based on one-way functions and constant-round secure multi-party computation can be based on enhanced trapdoor permutations; also here, earlier protocols additionally required either collision-resistant hash functions or subexponential one-way functions.", "citation": "Citations (40)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Huijia Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Huijia", "Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael"], "pages": 10}
