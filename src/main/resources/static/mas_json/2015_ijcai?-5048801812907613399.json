{"title": "Adversarial Hierarchical-Task Network Planning for Complex Real-Time Games.", "fields": ["combinatorial game theory", "hierarchical task network", "adversarial system", "monte carlo tree search", "game tree"], "abstract": "Real-time strategy (RTS) games are hard from an AI point of view because they have enormous state spaces, combinatorial branching factors, allow simultaneous and durative actions, and players have very little time to choose actions. For these reasons, standard game tree search methods such as alphabeta search or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are not sufficient by themselves to handle these games. This paper presents an alternative approach called Adversarial Hierarchical Task Network (AHTN) planning that combines ideas from game tree search with HTN planning. We present the basic algorithm, relate it to existing adversarial hierarchical planning methods, and present new extensions for simultaneous and durative actions to handle RTS games. We also present empirical results for the \u00b5RTS game, comparing it to other state of the art search algorithms for RTS games.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Drexel University", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Santiago Onta\u00f1\u00f3n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onta=ntilde==oacute=n:Santiago", "Michael Buro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buro:Michael"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
