Fluorescence is a common phenomenon occurring in many objects from natural gems and corals, to fluorescent dyes used in clothing. One of the important characteristics of fluorescence is its wavelength-shifting behavior: fluorescent materials absorb light at a certain wavelength and then reemit it at longer wavelengths. Due to the complexity of its emission process, fluorescence tends to be excluded from most algorithms in computer vision and image processing. In this paper, we show that there is a strong similarity between fluorescence and ideal diffuse reflection and that fluorescence can provide distinct clues on how to estimate an object's shape. Moreover, fluorescence's wavelength-shifting property enables us to estimate the shape of an object by applying photometric stereo to emission-only images without suffering from specular reflection. This is the significant advantage of the fluorescence-based method over previous methods based on reflection.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Imari Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Imari", "Takahiro Okabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okabe:Takahiro", "Yoichi Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Yoichi"], "pages": 8}
