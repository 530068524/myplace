{"title": "You read what you value: understanding personal values and reading interests.", "fields": ["universalism", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "This paper presents an experiment on the relationship between personal values and reading interests of online articles. Results suggest that individuals' values can predict their topical interests. For example, holding stronger universalism values predict interests towards environmental articles, whereas holding stronger achievement values predict interest towards work-related articles. Findings demonstrate the possibility of targeting based on individuals' personal values, but also highlight certain challenges and limitations when applying this approach for online content.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Washington", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gary Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Gary", "Jilin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jilin", "Jalal Mahmud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahmud:Jalal", "Jeffrey Nichols.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nichols:Jeffrey"], "pages": 4}
