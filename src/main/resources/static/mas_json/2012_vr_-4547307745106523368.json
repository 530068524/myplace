{"title": "The cognitive implications of semi-natural virtual locomotion.", "fields": ["virtual machine", "virtual reality", "memory management", "solid modeling", "spatial memory"], "abstract": "This study incorporated a dual-task paradigm, in which participants were asked to perform basic locomotion tasks with one of three interfaces while remembering a sequence of either spatial or verbal items. Interfaces varied in similarity to natural body movements. Stopping performance was compromised when concurrently remembering a spatial, but not verbal, sequence. Also users exhibited lower performance on spatial memory tasks while using more unnatural locomotion interfaces. These results confirm that semi-natural locomotion interfaces require spatial working memory resources and thus locomotion interfaces compete with ongoing spatial tasks, as opposed to those requiring verbal resources or general attention resources.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Mathematica Policy Research", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["William E.
