To investigate this opportunity, we began a service design project investigating how to create repeated information exchanges between riders and a transit agency in order to create a virtual \"place\" from which the dialog on services could take place. Through interviews with riders, a workshop with a transit agency, and speed dating of design concepts, we have developed a design direction. Specifically, we propose a service that combines vehicle location and \"fullness\" ratings provided by riders with dynamic route change information from the transit agency as a foundation for a dialog around riders conveying input for continuous service improvement.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Daisy Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Daisy", "John Zimmerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmerman:John", "Aaron Steinfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinfeld:Aaron", "Anthony Tomasic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomasic:Anthony"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
