{"title": "Discovering Non-Redundant K-means Clusterings in Optimal Subspaces.", "fields": ["subspace topology", "k means clustering", "cluster analysis", "linear subspace", "machine learning"], "abstract": "A huge object collection in high-dimensional space can often be clustered in more than one way, for instance, objects could be clustered by their shape or alternatively by their color. Each grouping represents a different view of the data set. The new research field of non-redundant clustering addresses this class of problems. In this paper, we follow the approach that different, non-redundant k-means-like clusterings may exist in different, arbitrarily oriented subspaces of the high-dimensional space. We assume that these subspaces (and optionally a further noise space without any cluster structure) are orthogonal to each other. This assumption enables a particularly rigorous mathematical treatment of the non-redundant clustering problem and thus a particularly efficient algorithm, which we call Nr-Kmeans (for non-redundant k-means). The superiority of our algorithm is demonstrated both theoretically, as well as in extensive experiments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "University of Vienna", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "authors": ["Dominik Mautz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mautz:Dominik", "Wei Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Wei", "Claudia Plant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plant:Claudia", "Christian B\u00f6hm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hm:Christian"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
