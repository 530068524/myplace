{"title": "The k-peak Decomposition: Mapping the Global Structure of Graphs.", "fields": ["strength of a graph", "topological graph theory", "graph product", "tree depth", "comparability graph"], "abstract": "The structure of real-world complex networks has long been an area of interest, and one common way to describe the structure of a network has been with the k-core decomposition. The core number of a node can be thought of as a measure of its centrality and importance, and is used by applications such as community detection, understanding viral spreads, and detecting fraudsters. However, we observe that the k-core decomposition suffers from an important flaw: namely, it is calculated globally, and so if the network contains distinct regions of different densities, the sparser among these regions may be neglected.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we propose the k-peak graph decomposition method, based on the k-core algorithm, which finds the centers of distinct regions in the graph. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We present a novel graph decomposition- the k-peak decomposition- and corresponding algorithm, and perform a theoretical analysis of its properties. (2) We describe a new visualization method, the \"Mountain Plot\", which can be used to better understand the global structure of a graph. (3) We perform an extensive empirical analysis of real-world graphs, including technological, social, biological, and collaboration graphs, and show how the k-peak decomposition gives insight into the structures of these graphs. (4) We demonstrate the advantage of using the k-peak decomposition in various applications, including community detection, contagion and identifying essential proteins.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Syracuse University", "Cornell University", "Syracuse University", "Syracuse University"], "authors": ["Priya Govindan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Govindan:Priya", "Chenghong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chenghong", "Chumeng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chumeng", "Hongyu Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Hongyu", "Sucheta Soundarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soundarajan:Sucheta"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
