{"title": "Unsupervised Event Coreference Resolution with Rich Linguistic Features.", "fields": ["categorical variable", "nonparametric statistics", "cluster analysis", "coreference", "bayesian probability"], "abstract": "This paper examines how a new class of nonparametric Bayesian models can be effectively applied to an open-domain event coreference task. Designed with the purpose of clustering complex linguistic objects, these models consider a potentially infinite number of features and categorical outcomes. The evaluation performed for solving both within- and cross-document event coreference shows significant improvements of the models when compared against two baselines for this task.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Cosmin Adrian Bejan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bejan:Cosmin_Adrian", "Sanda M.
