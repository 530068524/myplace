It uses reinforcement which rewards originality to induce users to explore the space of motions they can perform. A decomposition of movements into  motion primitives  is constructed, among which a meaningful originality metric can be defined. Because the originality measure is defined in terms of the sensed input, the resulting space contains only movements which can both be performed and sensed. We show how this can be used to evaluate the relative performance of different joint user-sensor systems, providing objective analyses of gesture lexicons with regard to the technical limitations of sensors and humans. In particular, we show how the space of motions varies across the arm for a body-mounted inertial sensor.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["John Williamson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williamson:John", "Roderick Murray-Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray=Smith:Roderick"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
