Therefore, we may ask: To what extent do standard premises of online community research apply in China? In our ethnographic studies of two Chinese websites, we found that small \"core teams\" organized and managed work, and were sustained by offline and behind the scenes interactions. We urge that research on online communities examine preconceptions that may overlook important realities, and that we be mindful that small close-knit groups may be relevant, in the original spirit of studies of cooperative work.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Yong Ming Kow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kow:Yong_Ming", "Bonnie A.
