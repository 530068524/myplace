The data set tracks close to a million subscribers over thousands of base stations. We analyze individual subscriber behaviors and observe a significant variation in network usage among subscribers. We characterize subscriber mobility and temporal activity patterns and identify their relation to traffic volume. We then investigate how efficiently radio resources are used by different subscribers as well as by different applications. We also analyze the network traffic from the point of view of the base stations and find significant temporal and spatial variations in different parts of the network, while the aggregated behavior appears predictable. Broadly, our observations deliver important insights into network-wide resource usage. We describe implications in pricing, protocol design and resource and spectrum management.", "citation": "Citations (386)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Alcatel-Lucent", "Bell Labs", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Utpal Paul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paul:Utpal", "Anand Prabhu Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Anand_Prabhu", "Milind M.
