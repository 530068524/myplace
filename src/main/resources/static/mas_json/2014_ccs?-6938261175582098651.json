Although much progress has been made towards a more secure infrastructure, the currently proposed approaches still suffer from security vulnerabilities, inefficiency, or incremental deployment challenges.   In this paper we propose PoliCert, a comprehensive log-based and domain-oriented architecture that enhances the security of PKI by offering: a) stronger authentication of a domain's public keys, b) comprehensive and clean mechanisms for certificate management, and c) an incentivised incremental deployment plan. Surprisingly, our approach has proved fruitful in addressing other seemingly unrelated problems such as TLS-related error handling and client/server misconfiguration.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Carnegie Mellon University", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Pawel Szalachowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szalachowski:Pawel", "Stephanos Matsumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsumoto:Stephanos", "Adrian Perrig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perrig:Adrian"], "pages": 12}
