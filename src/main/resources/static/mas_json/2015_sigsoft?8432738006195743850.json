{"title": "T3i: a tool for generating and querying test suites for Java.", "fields": ["java annotation", "test suite", "java syntax", "java modeling language", "exploratory testing"], "abstract": "T3i is an automated unit-testing tool to test Java classes. To expose interactions T3i generates test-cases in the form of sequences of calls to the methods of the target class. What separates it from other testing tools is that it treats test suites as first class objects and allows users to e.g. combine, query, and filter them. With these operations, the user can construct a test suite with specific properties. Queries can be used to check correctness properties. Hoare triples, LTL formulas, and algebraic equations can be queried. T3i can be used interactively, thus facilitating more exploratory testing, as well as through a script. The familiar Java syntax can be used to control it, or alternatively one can use the much lighter Groovy syntax.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Utrecht University"], "authors": ["I.
