Leveraging this idea, cosegmentation jointly segments common regions from multiple images. In this paper, we propose CoSand, a distributed cosegmentation approach for a highly variable large-scale image collection. The segmentation task is modeled by temperature maximization on anisotropic heat diffusion, of which the temperature maximization with finite K heat sources corresponds to a K-way segmentation that maximizes the segmentation confidence of every pixel in an image. We show that our method takes advantage of a strong theoretic property in that the temperature under linear anisotropic diffusion is a submodular function; therefore, a greedy algorithm guarantees at least a constant factor approximation to the optimal solution for temperature maximization. Our theoretic result is successfully applied to scalable cosegmentation as well as diversity ranking and single-image segmentation. We evaluate CoSand on MSRC and ImageNet datasets, and show its competence both in competitive performance over previous work, and in much superior scalability.", "citation": "Citations (257)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Stanford University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Gunhee Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Gunhee", "Eric P.
