Unlike previously proposed gradient flows, we achieve superlinear convergence rates through an approximation of the shape Hessian, which is generally hard to compute and suffers from a series of degeneracies. Our analysis highlights the role of mean curvature motion in comparison with first-order schemes: instead of surface area, our approach penalizes deformation, either by its Dirichlet energy or total variation, and hence does not suffer from shrinkage. The latter regularizer sparks the development of an alternating direction method of multipliers on triangular meshes. Therein, a conjugate-gradient solver enables us to bypass formation of the Gaussian normal equations appearing in the course of the overall optimization. We combine all of these ideas in a versatile geometric variation-regularized Levenberg-Marquardt-type method applicable to a variety of shape functionals, depending on intrinsic properties of the surface such as normal field and curvature as well as its embedding into space.
