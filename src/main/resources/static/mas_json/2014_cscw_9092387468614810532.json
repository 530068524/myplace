However, people's task resumption ability is compromised by disruptive environments and human cognitive limitations. We propose that a helpful intervention is to provide visual feedback about the duration of a suspended task. Results from a controlled study show significantly shorter average off-task time by adding visual feedback. Further, using emotionally attachable visual objects in the visualization has the additional benefit of decreasing off-task time without increasing stress. Punishment-oriented persuasion strategies produced faster resumption, but also caused higher stress levels. Combined with other related results, we discuss the implications for design as well directions for future study.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Yikun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yikun", "Yuan Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yuan", "Wei Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Wei", "Mark S.
