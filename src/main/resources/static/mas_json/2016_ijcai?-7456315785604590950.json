This allows for assigning default values to constraint variables or to leave them undefined. Also, it provides us with a semantic framework integrating ASP and Constraint Processing in a uniform way. We put some emphasis on logic programs dealing with linear constraints on integer variables, where we further introduce a directional assignment operator. We elaborate upon the formal relation and implementation of these programs in terms of Constraint ASP, sketching an existing system.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Corunna, Spain"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Pedro Cabalar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cabalar:Pedro", "Roland Kaminski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaminski:Roland", "Max Ostrowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrowski:Max", "Torsten Schaub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaub:Torsten"], "pages": 7}
