{"title": "On the Value of Multiple Read/Write Streams for Approximating Frequency Moments.", "fields": ["streaming algorithm", "deterministic algorithm", "data stream mining", "data stream", "communication complexity", "upper and lower bounds", "streams", "binary logarithm"], "abstract": "We consider the read/write streams model, an extension of the standard data stream model in which an algorithm can create and manipulate multiple read/write streams in addition to its input data stream. We show that any randomized read/write stream algorithm with a fixed number of streams and a sublogarithmic number of passes that produces a constant factor approximation of the k-th frequency moment F k  of an input sequence of length of at most N from {1, ..., N} requires space Omega(N 1-4/k-delta ) for any delta > 0. For comparison, it is known that with a single read-only data stream there is a randomized constant- factor approximation for F k  using O(N 1-2/k ) space and that there is a deterministic algorithm computing F k  exactly using 3 read/write streams, O(log N) passes, and O(log N) space. Therefore, although the ability to manipulate multiple read/write streams can add substantial power to the data stream model, with a sub-logarithmic number of passes this does not significantly improve the ability to approximate higher frequency moments efficiently. Our lower bounds also apply to (1 + epsi)-approximations of F k  for epsi ges 1/N.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Paul Beame.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beame:Paul", "Dang-Trinh Huynh-Ngoc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huynh=Ngoc:Dang=Trinh"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
