{"title": "SEMMO: a scalable engine for massively multiplayer online games.", "fields": ["serialization", "first playable demo", "game semantics", "systems architecture", "exploit"], "abstract": "We propose to demonstrate SEMMO, a consistency server for MMOs. The key features of SEMMO are its novel distributed consistency protocol and system architecture. The distributed nature of the engine allows the clients to perform all computations locally; the only computation that the central server performs is to determine the serialization order of game actions.   We will demo SEMMO through a game called Manhattan Pals, and show how we can exploit game semantics in order to support large-scale MMOs. In the demo, avatars of the audience will be able to play Manhattan Pals and thus experience various scalability and consistency effects of an MMO.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Nitin Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta_0003:Nitin", "Alan J.
