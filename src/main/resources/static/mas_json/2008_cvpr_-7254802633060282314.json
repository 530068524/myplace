{"title": "Fusion of time-of-flight depth and stereo for high accuracy depth maps.", "fields": ["sensor fusion", "depth map", "stereopsis", "time of flight", "belief propagation"], "abstract": "Time-of-flight range sensors have error characteristics which are complementary to passive stereo. They provide real time depth estimates in conditions where passive stereo does not work well, such as on white walls. In contrast, these sensors are noisy and often perform poorly on the textured scenes for which stereo excels. We introduce a method for combining the results from both methods that performs better than either alone. A depth probability distribution function from each method is calculated and then merged. In addition, stereo methods have long used global methods such as belief propagation and graph cuts to improve results, and we apply these methods to this sensor. Since time-of-flight devices have primarily been used as individual sensors, they are typically poorly calibrated. We introduce a method that substantially improves upon the manufacturerpsilas calibration. We show that these techniques lead to improved accuracy and robustness.", "citation": "Citations (313)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Kentucky", "University of Kentucky", "University of Kentucky", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jiejie Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jiejie", "Liang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Liang", "Ruigang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ruigang", "James Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:James"], "pages": -1}
