{"title": "A Non-convex One-Pass Framework for Generalized Factorization Machine and Rank-One Matrix Sensing.", "fields": ["coefficient matrix", "regular polygon", "gaussian", "matrix completion", "phase retrieval"], "abstract": "We develop an efficient alternating framework for learning a generalized version of Factorization Machine (gFM) on steaming data with provable guarantees. When the instances are sampled from $d$ dimensional random Gaussian vectors and the target second order coefficient matrix in gFM is of rank $k$, our algorithm converges linearly, achieves $O(\\epsilon)$ recovery error after retrieving $O(k^{3}d\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ training instances, consumes $O(kd)$ memory in one-pass of dataset and only requires matrix-vector product operations in each iteration. The key ingredient of our framework is a construction of an estimation sequence endowed with a so-called Conditionally Independent RIP condition (CI-RIP). As special cases of gFM, our framework can be applied to symmetric or asymmetric rank-one matrix sensing problems, such as inductive matrix completion and phase retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Computational M ...
