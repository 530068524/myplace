{"title": "Why-Question Answering using Intra- and Inter-Sentential Causal Relations.", "fields": ["question answering", "machine learning", "test set", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the utility of intra- and inter-sentential causal relations between terms or clauses as evidence for answering why-questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses both intra- and inter-sentential causal relations for why-QA. We also propose a method for assessing the appropriateness of causal relations as answers to a given question using the semantic orientation of excitation proposed by Hashimoto et al. (2012). By applying these ideas to Japanese why-QA, we improved precision by 4.4% against all the questions in our test set over the current state-of-theart system for Japanese why-QA. In addition, unlike the state-of-the-art system, our system could achieve very high precision (83.2%) for 25% of all the questions in the test set by restricting its output to the confident answers only.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jong-Hoon Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Jong=Hoon", "Kentaro Torisawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torisawa:Kentaro", "Chikara Hashimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashimoto:Chikara", "Motoki Sano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sano:Motoki", "Stijn De Saeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saeger:Stijn_De", "Kiyonori Ohtake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohtake:Kiyonori"], "pages": 11}
