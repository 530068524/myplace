{"title": "Compact signatures for high-speed interest point description and matching.", "fields": ["statistical classification", "exploit", "scale invariant feature transform", "sparse matrix", "speedup"], "abstract": "Prominent feature point descriptors such as SIFT and SURF allow reliable real-time matching but at a computational cost that limits the number of points that can be handled on PCs, and even more on less powerful mobile devices. A recently proposed technique that relies on statistical classification to compute signatures has the potential to be much faster but at the cost of using very large amounts of memory, which makes it impractical for implementation on low-memory devices. In this paper, we show that we can exploit the sparseness of these signatures to compact them, speed up the computation, and drastically reduce memory usage. We base our approach on Compressive Sensing theory. We also highlight its effectiveness by incorporating it into two very different SLAM packages and demonstrating substantial performance increases.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Willow Garage", "Willow Garage"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Michael Calonder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calonder:Michael", "Vincent Lepetit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepetit:Vincent", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal", "Kurt Konolige.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konolige:Kurt", "James Bowman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowman:James", "Patrick Mihelich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mihelich:Patrick"], "pages": 8}
