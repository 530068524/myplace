We exemplify their use and study the complexity of their model checking problem. We show a range of results ranging from PTIME to PSPACE-hard depending on the logic considered.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Alessio Lomuscio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lomuscio:Alessio", "Jakub Michaliszyn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michaliszyn:Jakub"], "pages": 7}
