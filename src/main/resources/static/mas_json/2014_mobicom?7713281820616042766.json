{"title": "Demo: high-precision RFID tracking using COTS devies.", "fields": ["trajectory", "mobile rfid", "real time computing", "computer science"], "abstract": "In many applications, we have to identify an object and then locate the object to within high precision (centimeter- or millimeter-level). Tracking mobile RFID tags in real time has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving high precision. We achieve these three goals by leveraging the phase value of the backscattered signal, provided by the COTS RFID readers, to estimate the location of the object. To illustrate the basic idea of our system, we firstly focus on a simple scenario where the tag is moving along a fixed track known to the system. We propose Differential Augmented Hologram (DAH) which will facilitate the instant tracking of the mobile RFID tag to a high precision. We then devise a comprehensive solution to accurately recover the tag's moving trajectory and its locations, relaxing the assumption of knowing tag's track function in advance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "IIT, Chicago, USA"], "authors": ["Lei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0025:Lei", "Yekui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yekui", "Chen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chen", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Xuan Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Xuan", "Yi Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yi", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
