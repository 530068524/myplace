{"title": "Opportunistic Scheduling with Reliability Guarantees in Cognitive Radio Networks.", "fields": ["cognitive radio", "lyapunov optimization", "mobile radio", "fair share scheduling", "cognitive network"], "abstract": "We develop opportunistic scheduling policies for cognitive radio networks that maximize the throughput utility of the secondary (unlicensed) users subject to maximum collision constraints with the primary (licensed) users. We consider a cognitive network with static primary users and potentially mobile secondary users. We use the technique of Lyapunov optimization to design an online flow control, scheduling, and resource allocation algorithm that meets the desired objectives and provides explicit performance guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (340)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Rahul Urgaonkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urgaonkar:Rahul", "Michael J.
