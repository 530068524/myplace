Our goal is to use bilingual cues to learn improved parsing models for each language and to evaluate these models on held-out monolingual test data. We formulate a generative Bayesian model which seeks to explain the observed parallel data through a combination of bilingual and monolingual parameters. To this end, we adapt a formalism known as unordered tree alignment to our probabilistic setting. Using this formalism, our model loosely binds parallel trees while allowing language-specific syntactic structure. We perform inference under this model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and dynamic programming. Applying this model to three parallel corpora (Korean-English, Urdu-English, and Chinese-English) we find substantial performance gains over the CCM model, a strong monolingual baseline. On average, across a variety of testing scenarios, our model achieves an 8.8 absolute gain in F-measure.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Benjamin Snyder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snyder:Benjamin", "Tahira Naseem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naseem:Tahira", "Regina Barzilay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barzilay:Regina"], "pages": 9}
