Specifically, we design a distribution over m x n matrices  A  such that for any x, given Ax, we can recover a k-sparse approximation to x under the EMD distance. One construction yields m=O(k log (n/k)) and a 1 + e approximation factor, which matches the best achievable bound for other error measures, such as the l 1  norm.   Our algorithms are obtained by exploiting novel connections to other problems and areas, such as  streaming algorithms for k-median clustering  and  model-based compressive sensing.  We also provide novel algorithms and results for the latter problems.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Piotr Indyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Indyk:Piotr", "Eric Price.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Price:Eric"], "pages": 10}
