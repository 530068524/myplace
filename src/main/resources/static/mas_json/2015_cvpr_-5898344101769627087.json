It revitalizes an early idea of piecewise parametric flow model. A key innovation is that, we fit a flow field piecewise to a variety of parametric models, where the domain of each piece (i.e., each piece's shape, position and size) is determined adaptively, while at the same time maintaining a global inter-piece flow continuity constraint. We achieve this by a multi-model fitting scheme via energy minimization. Our energy takes into account both the piecewise constant model assumption and the flow field continuity constraint, enabling the proposed method to effectively handle both homogeneous motions and complex motions. The experiments on three public optical flow benchmarks (KITTI, MPI Sintel, and Middlebury) show the superiority of our method compared with the state of the art: it achieves top-tier performances on all the three benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Australian National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jiaolong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jiaolong", "Hongdong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongdong"], "pages": 9}
