Achieving this goal requires solving a novel uncalibrated DfF problem and aligning the frames to account for scene parallax. Our approach is demonstrated on a range of challenging cases and produces high quality results.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Google", "University of Washington"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Supasorn Suwajanakorn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suwajanakorn:Supasorn", "Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hern=aacute=ndez:Carlos", "Steven M.
