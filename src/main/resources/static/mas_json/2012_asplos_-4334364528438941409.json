In this paper we describe Green-Marl, a domain-specific language (DSL) whose high level language constructs allow developers to describe their graph analysis algorithms intuitively, but expose the data-level parallelism inherent in the algorithms. We also present our Green-Marl compiler which translates high-level algorithmic description written in Green-Marl into an efficient C++ implementation by exploiting this exposed data-level parallelism. Furthermore, our Green-Marl compiler applies a set of optimizations that take advantage of the high-level semantic knowledge encoded in the Green-Marl DSL. We demonstrate that graph analysis algorithms can be written very intuitively with Green-Marl through some examples, and our experimental results show that the compiler-generated implementation out of such descriptions performs as well as or better than highly-tuned hand-coded implementations.", "citation": "Citations (240)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Oracle Corporation", "Stanford University"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Sungpack Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Sungpack", "Hassan Chafi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chafi:Hassan", "Eric Sedlar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sedlar:Eric", "Kunle Olukotun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olukotun:Kunle"], "pages": 14}
