{"title": "Automatic inference of code transforms for patch generation.", "fields": ["java", "inference", "computer science", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We present a new system, Genesis, that processes human patches to automatically infer code transforms for automatic patch generation. We present results that characterize the effectiveness of the Genesis inference algorithms and the complete Genesis patch generation system working with real-world patches and defects collected from 372 Java projects. To the best of our knowledge, Genesis is the first system to automatically infer patch generation transforms or candidate patch search spaces from previous successful patches.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, San Diego", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Fan Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Fan", "Peter Amidon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amidon:Peter", "Martin Rinard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rinard:Martin"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
