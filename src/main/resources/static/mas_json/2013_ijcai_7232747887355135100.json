At the strategic level, there are computational models which study supply and distribution networks with environmental considerations. At the operational level, there are, for example, routing and scheduling models which are constrained by carbon emissions. Our paper explores work in tactical planning with regards to vehicle resource allocation from distribution centers to customer locations in a multi-echelon logistics network. We formulate the bi-objective optimization problem exactly and design a memetic algorithm to efficiently derive an approximate Pareto front. We illustrate the applicability of our approach with a large real-world dataset.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "DHL Supply Chain, Singapore"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Hoong Chuin Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Hoong_Chuin", "Lucas Agussurja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agussurja:Lucas", "Shih-Fen Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Shih=Fen", "Pang Jin Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Pang_Jin"], "pages": 7}
