{"title": "Using Time-Anchored Peer Comments to Enhance Social Interaction in Online Educational Videos.", "fields": ["clips", "interactivity", "instructional design", "peer support", "scalability"], "abstract": "Online learning is increasingly prevalent as an option for self-learning and as a resource for instructional design. Prerecorded video is currently the main medium of online education content delivery and instruction; this affords asynchronicity and flexibility, and enables the dissemination of lecture content in a distributed and scalable manner. However, the same properties may impede learners' engagement due to the lack of social interaction and peer support. In this paper, we propose a time-anchored commenting interface to allow online learners who watch the same video clips to exchange comments on them. Comments left by previous learners at specific time points of a video are displayed to new learners when they watch the same video and reach those time points. We investigated how the display of time-anchored comments (dynamic or static) and type of comments (content-related or social-oriented) influenced users' perceived engagement, perceived social interactivity, and learning outcomes. Our results show that dynamically displaying time-anchored comments can indeed enhance learners' perceived social interactivity. Moreover, the content of comments would further affect learners' intention of commenting. Based on our findings, we make various recommendations for the improvement of social interaction and learning experience in online education.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National Chiao Tung University", "National Chiao Tung University", "National Chiao Tung University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Chiao Tung University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yi-Chieh Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yi=Chieh", "Wen-Chieh Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Wen=Chieh", "Fu-Yin Cherng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherng:Fu=Yin", "Hao-Chuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hao=Chuan", "Ching-Ying Sung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sung:Ching=Ying", "Jung-Tai King.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King:Jung=Tai"], "pages": 10}
