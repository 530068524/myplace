A promising option is ridesharing, defined as use of the same vehicle by two or more people traveling to a common destination. In particular, mobile computer supported ridesharing provides a promising way to enlarge older adults' mobility choices in addition to private driving and public transportation options. In order to understand the opportunities and obstacles of ridesharing from the point of view of elderly people, we conducted an interview study in order to examining ridesharing experiences. It turns out that \"mobile independence\" and \"decisional autonomy\" are key issues for mobile wellbeing. This partially conflicts with common ridesharing concepts. Hence, we further analyze older adults' strategies dealing with these conflicts and show that these strategies offer departure points for the design ridesharing solutions, which are better suited to the demands of older adults.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Johanna Meurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meurer:Johanna", "Martin Stein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stein:Martin", "David Randall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Randall:David", "Markus Rohde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rohde:Markus", "Volker Wulf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulf:Volker"], "pages": 10}
