{"title": "Understanding and detecting wake lock misuses for Android applications.", "fields": ["lock", "android", "wake", "program analysis", "user experience design"], "abstract": "Wake locks are widely used in Android apps to protect critical computations from being disrupted by device sleeping. Inappropriate use of wake locks often seriously impacts user experience. However, little is known on how wake locks are used in real-world Android apps and the impact of their misuses. To bridge the gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on 44,736 commercial and 31 open-source Android apps. By automated program analysis and manual investigation, we observed (1) common program points where wake locks are acquired and released, (2) 13 types of critical computational tasks that are often protected by wake locks, and (3) eight patterns of wake lock misuses that commonly cause functional and non-functional issues, only three of which had been studied by existing work. Based on our findings, we designed a static analysis technique, Elite, to detect two most common patterns of wake lock misuses. Our experiments on real-world subjects showed that Elite is effective and can outperform two state-of-the-art techniques.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Nanjing University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Yepang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yepang", "Chang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Chang", "Shing-Chi Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Shing=Chi", "Valerio Terragni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terragni:Valerio"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
