We present a versatile binarization algorithm that can be tailored to a number of grammar formalisms by simply varying a formal parameter. We apply our algorithm to binarizing tree-to-string transducers used in syntax-based machine translation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "University of Potsdam", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Matthias B\u00fcchse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=uuml=chse:Matthias", "Alexander Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Alexander", "Heiko Vogler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogler:Heiko"], "pages": 10}
