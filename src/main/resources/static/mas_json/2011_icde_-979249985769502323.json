Skylines are essentially sets of most interesting (undominated) tuples in a database. However, since the skyline is often very large, much research effort has been devoted to identifying a smaller subset of (say k) \u201crepresentative skyline\u201d points. Several different definitions of representative skylines have been considered. Most of these formulations are intuitive in that they try to achieve some kind of clustering \u201cspread\u201d over the entire skyline, with k points. In this work, we take a more principled approach in defining the representative skyline objective. One of our main contributions is to formulate the problem of displaying k representative skyline points such that the probability that a random user would click on one of them is maximized.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Atish Das Sarma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarma:Atish_Das", "Ashwin Lall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lall:Ashwin", "Danupon Nanongkai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanongkai:Danupon", "Richard J.
