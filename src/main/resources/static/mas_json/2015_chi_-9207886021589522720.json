{"title": "Sharing is Caring: Assistive Technology Designs on Thingiverse.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "3d printing", "rapid prototyping", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "An increasing number of online communities support the open-source sharing of designs that can be built using rapid prototyping to construct physical objects. In this paper, we examine the designs and motivations for assistive technology found on Thingiverse.com, the largest of these communities at the time of this writing. We present results from a survey of all assistive technology that has been posted to Thingiverse since 2008 and a questionnaire distributed to the designers exploring their relationship with assistive technology and the motivation for creating these designs. The majority of these designs are intended to be manufactured on a 3D printer and include assistive devices and modifications for individuals with disabilities, older adults, and medication management. Many of these designs are created by the end-users themselves or on behalf of friends and loved ones. These designers frequently have no formal training or expertise in the creation of assistive technology. This paper discusses trends within this community as well as future opportunities and challenges.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "Colorado State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Erin Buehler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buehler:Erin", "Stacy M.
