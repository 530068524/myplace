Oblivious RAM is often cited as a powerful tool, but is also commonly considered to be impractical due to its overhead, which is asymptotically efficient but is quite high. We redesign the oblivious RAM protocol using modern tools, namely Cuckoo hashing and a new oblivious sorting algorithm. The resulting protocol uses only O(n) external memory, and replaces each data request by only O(log2 n) requests.", "citation": "Citations (261)", "departments": ["University of Haifa", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "University of Hong Kong", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Benny Pinkas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinkas:Benny", "Tzachy Reinman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reinman:Tzachy"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2010", "pages": 18}
