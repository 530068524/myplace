In this paper, we ask whether developers use the cryptographic APIs in a fashion that provides typical cryptographic notions of security, e.g., IND-CPA security. We develop program analysis techniques to automatically check programs on the Google Play marketplace, and find that 10.327 out of 11,748 applications that use cryptographic APIs -- 88% overall -- make at least one mistake. These numbers show that applications do not use cryptographic APIs in a fashion that maximizes overall security. We then suggest specific remediations based on our analysis towards improving overall cryptographic security in Android applications.", "citation": "Citations (230)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Manuel Egele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egele:Manuel", "David Brumley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brumley:David", "Yanick Fratantonio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fratantonio:Yanick", "Christopher Kruegel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kruegel:Christopher"], "pages": 12}
