{"title": "A study on icon arrangement by smartphone users.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "multimedia", "computer science", "icon"], "abstract": "The number of available mobile applications is steadily increasing. People have rapidly adopted application stores as means to customize their devices with various functionalities that go beyond communication. Understanding the principles of mobile application usage is crucial for supporting users within this new ecosystem. In this paper, we investigate how people organize applications they have installed on their devices. We asked more than 130 participants for their habits for icon arrangement and collected more than 1,400 screenshots of their devices' menus to further ground our findings. Based on this data we can distinguish five different concepts for arranging icons on smartphone menus, e.g. based on application usage frequency and applications' functional relatedness. Additionally, we investigated how these concepts emerge in relation to frequency of application installations, removals and icon rearrangements, as well as users' experience levels. Finally we discuss implications for the design of smartphone launchers, and highlight differences to icon arrangement on stationary computers.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["DFKI GmbH, Saar ... r\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI GmbH, Saar ... r\u00fccken, Germany"], "authors": ["Matthias B\u00f6hmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hmer_0001:Matthias", "Antonio Kr\u00fcger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=ger:Antonio"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
