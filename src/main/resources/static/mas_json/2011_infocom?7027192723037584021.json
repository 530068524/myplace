In such a model, the spectrum is divided into channels and periodically allocated to competing base stations using an auction-based market mechanism. An \u201cefficient\u201d auction mechanism is essential to the success of such a dynamic spectrum access model. Two of the key objectives in designing an auction mechanism are \u201ctruthfulness\u201d and revenue maximization. In this article, we design a polynomial-time spectrum auction mechanism that is truthful and yields an allocation with O(1)-approximate expected revenue, in the Bayesian setting. Our mechanism generalizes to general interference models. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to design a polynomial-time truthful spectrum auction mechanism with a performance guarantee on the expected revenue. We demonstrate the performance of our designed mechanism through simulations.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Mahmoud Al-Ayyoub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Al=Ayyoub:Mahmoud", "Himanshu Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Himanshu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
