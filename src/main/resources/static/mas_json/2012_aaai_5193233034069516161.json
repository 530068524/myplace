{"title": "Coupling Spatiotemporal Disease Modeling with Diagnosis.", "fields": ["infectious disease", "inference", "disease", "state space representation", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Modelling the density of an infectious disease in space and time is a task generally carried out separately from the diagnosis of that disease in individuals. These two inference problems are complementary, however: diagnosis of disease can be done more accurately if prior information from a spatial risk model is employed, and in turn a disease density model can benefit from the incorporation of rich symptomatic information rather than simple counts of presumed cases of infection. We propose a unifying framework for both of these tasks, and illustrate it with the case of malaria. To do this we first introduce a state space model of malaria spread, and secondly a computer vision based system for detecting plasmodium in microscopical blood smear images, which can be run on location-aware mobile devices. We demonstrate the tractability of combining both elements and the improvement in accuracy this brings about.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Makerere University", "Makerere University", "University of Edinburgh", "Makerere University"], "authors": ["Martin Gordon Mubangizi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mubangizi:Martin_Gordon", "Caterine Ikae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikae:Caterine", "Athina Spiliopoulou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spiliopoulou:Athina", "John A.
