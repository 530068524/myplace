However, many of the techniques developed for compact representations of security games do not extend to Bayesian security games, which allow us to model uncertainty about the attacker's type. In this paper, we introduce a general framework of catcher-evader games that can capture Bayesian security games as well as other game families of interest. We show that computing Stackelberg strategies is NP-hard, but give an algorithm for computing a Nash equilibrium that performs well in experiments. We also prove that the Nash equilibria of these games satisfy the interchangeability property, so that equilibrium selection is not an issue.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yuqian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuqian", "Vincent Conitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conitzer:Vincent", "Dmytro Korzhyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korzhyk:Dmytro"], "pages": 9}
