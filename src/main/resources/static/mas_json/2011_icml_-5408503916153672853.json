{"title": "Risk-Based Generalizations of f-divergences.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "estimator", "divergence", "generalization", "nice"], "abstract": "We derive a generalized notion of f-divergences, called (f, l)-divergences. We show that this generalization enjoys many of the nice properties of f-divergences, although it is a richer family. It also provides alternative definitions of standard divergences in terms of surrogate risks. As a first practical application of this theory, we derive a new estimator for the Kulback-Leibler divergence that we use for clustering sets of vectors.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Charles III University of Madrid", "Australian National University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Dario Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garc=iacute=a=Garc=iacute=a:Dario", "Ulrike von Luxburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luxburg:Ulrike_von", "Ra\u00fal Santos-Rodr\u00edguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santos=Rodr=iacute=guez:Ra=uacute=l"], "pages": 8}
