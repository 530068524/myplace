This problem is closely related to the usual (computational) Diffie\u2013Hellman problem and can be used in many of the same cryptographic constructions that are based on the Diffie\u2013Hellman problem. Moreover, the twin Diffie\u2013Hellman problem is at least as hard as the ordinary Diffie\u2013Hellman problem. However, we are able to show that the twin Diffie\u2013Hellman problem remains hard, even in the presence of a decision oracle that recognizes solutions to the problem\u2014this is a feature not enjoyed by the Diffie\u2013Hellman problem, in general. Specifically, we show how to build a certain \u201ctrapdoor test\u201d that allows us to effectively answer decision oracle queries for the twin Diffie\u2013Hellman problem without knowing any of the corresponding discrete logarithms. Our new techniques have many applications. As one such application, we present a new variant of ElGamal encryption with very short ciphertexts, and with a very simple and tight security proof, in the random oracle model, under the assumption that the ordinary Diffie\u2013Hellman problem is hard. We present several other applications as well, including a new variant of Diffie and Hellman\u2019s non-interactive key exchange protocol; a new variant of Cramer\u2013Shoup encryption, with a very simple proof in the standard model; a new variant of Boneh\u2013Franklin identity-based encryption, with very short ciphertexts; a more robust version of a password-authenticated key exchange protocol of Abdalla and Pointcheval.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing", "New York University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "New York University", "CWI, Cryptology ... he Netherlands", "Cryptology & In ... he Netherlands"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["David Cash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cash:David", "Eike Kiltz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiltz:Eike", "Victor Shoup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shoup:Victor"], "pages": 19}
