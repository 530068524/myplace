{"title": "Accelerating aggregation using intra-cycle parallelism.", "fields": ["parallel processing", "cpu shielding", "multi core processor", "cpu time", "central processing unit"], "abstract": "Modern CPUs have word width of 64 bits but real data values are usually represented using bits fewer than a CPU word. This underutilization of CPU at register level has motivated the recent development of bit-parallel algorithms that carry out data processing operations (e.g., filter scan) on CPU words packed with data values (e.g., 8 data values are packed into one 64-bit word). Bit-parallel algorithms fully unleash the intra-cycle parallelism of modern CPUs and they are especially attractive to main-memory column stores whose goal is to process data at the speed of the \u201cbare metal\u201d. Main-memory column stores generally focus on analytical queries, where aggregation is a common operation. Current bit-parallel algorithms, however, have not covered aggregation yet. In this paper, we present a suite of bit-parallel algorithms to accelerate all standard aggregation operations: SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, MEDIAN, COUNT. The algorithms are designed to fully leverage the intra-cycle parallelism in CPU cores when aggregating words of packed values. Experimental evaluation shows that our bit-parallel aggregation algorithms exhibit significant performance benefits compared with non-bit-parallel methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Ziqiang Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Ziqiang", "Eric Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo:Eric"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
