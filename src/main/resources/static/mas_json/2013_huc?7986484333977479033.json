{"title": "Exploring capturable everyday memory for autobiographical authentication.", "fields": ["android", "internet privacy", "authentication", "systematic error", "bayesian inference"], "abstract": "We explore how well the intersection between our own everyday memories and those captured by our smartphones can be used for what we call autobiographical authentication-a challenge-response authentication system that queries users about day-to-day experiences. Through three studies-two on MTurk and one field study-we found that users are good, but make systematic errors at answering autobiographical questions. Using Bayesian modeling to account for these systematic response errors, we derived a formula for computing a confidence rating that the attempting authenticator is the user from a sequence of question-answer responses. We tested our formula against five simulated adversaries based on plausible real-life counterparts. Our simulations indicate that our model of autobiographical authentication generally performs well in assigning high confidence estimates to the user and low confidence estimates to impersonating adversaries.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Sauvik Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Sauvik", "Eiji Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi:Eiji", "Jason I.
