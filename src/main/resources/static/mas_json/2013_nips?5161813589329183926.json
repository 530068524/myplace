We propose a multi-task Gaussian process approach for modeling both the relatedness between regressors and the task correlations in the residuals, in order to more accurately identify true sharing between regressors. The resulting Gaussian model has a covariance term in form of a sum of Kronecker products, for which efficient parameter inference and out of sample prediction are feasible. On both synthetic examples and applications to phenotype prediction in genetics, we find substantial benefits of modeling structured noise compared to established alternatives.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Microsoft", "Max Planck Society", "European Bioinformatics Institute"], "authors": ["Barbara Rakitsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rakitsch:Barbara", "Christoph Lippert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lippert:Christoph", "Karsten M.
