{"title": "No-Regret Algorithms for Unconstrained Online Convex Optimization.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "feasible region", "convex optimization", "regret", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Some of the most compelling applications of online convex optimization, including online prediction and classification, are unconstrained: the natural feasible set is \u211dn. Existing algorithms fail to achieve sub-linear regret in this setting unless constraints on the comparator point \u1e8b are known in advance. We present algorithms that, without such prior knowledge, offer near-optimal regret bounds with respect to any choice of \u1e8b. In particular, regret with respect to \u1e8b = 0 is constant. We then prove lower bounds showing that our guarantees are near-optimal in this setting.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Google", "Duolingo, Inc., ...
