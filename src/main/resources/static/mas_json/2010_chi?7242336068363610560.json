{"title": "Multi-touch authentication on tabletops.", "fields": ["multi touch", "usable", "password", "shoulder surfing", "exploit"], "abstract": "The introduction of tabletop interfaces has given rise to the need for the development of secure and usable authentication techniques that are appropriate for the co-located collaborative settings for which they have been designed. Most commonly, user authentication is based on  something you know , but this is a particular problem for tabletop interfaces, as they are particularly vulnerable to  shoulder surfing  given their remit to foster co-located collaboration. In other words, tabletop users would typically authenticate in full view of a number of observers. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a number of novel tabletop authentication schemes that exploit the features of multi-touch interaction in order to inhibit shoulder surfing. In our pilot work with users, and in our formal user-evaluation, one authentication scheme - Pressure-Grid - stood out, significantly enhancing shoulder surfing resistance when participants used it to enter both PINs and graphical passwords.", "citation": "Citations (148)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Northumbria University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:David", "Paul Dunphy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunphy:Paul", "Pamela Briggs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Briggs:Pamela", "Jonathan Hook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hook:Jonathan", "John Nicholson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nicholson:John", "James Nicholson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nicholson:James", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick"], "pages": 10}
