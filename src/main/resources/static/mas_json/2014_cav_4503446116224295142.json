The automaton is the product of a master automaton and an array of slave automata, one for each G-subformula of i\u00be?. The slave automaton for G i\u00be? is in charge of recognizing whether FG i\u00be? holds. As opposed to standard determinization procedures, the states of all our automata have a clear logical structure, which allows for various optimizations. Our construction subsumes former algorithms for fragments of LTL. Experimental results show improvement in the sizes of the resulting automata compared to existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Javier Esparza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esparza:Javier", "Jan Kret\u00ednsk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kret=iacute=nsk=yacute=:Jan"], "pages": 17}
