{"title": "Convex Co-embedding.", "fields": ["scaling", "regular polygon", "machine learning", "embedding", "ranking"], "abstract": "We present a general framework for association learning, where entities are embedded in a common latent space to express relatedness via geometry--an approach that underlies the state of the art for link prediction, relation learning, multi-label tagging, relevance retrieval and ranking. Although current approaches rely on local training methods applied to non-convex formulations, we demonstrate how general convex formulations can be achieved for entity embedding, both for standard multi-linear and prototype-distance models. We investigate an efficient optimization strategy that allows scaling. An experimental evaluation reveals the advantages of global training in different case studies.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Temple University", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Farzaneh Mirzazadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirzazadeh:Farzaneh", "Yuhong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yuhong", "Dale Schuurmans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuurmans:Dale"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 8}
