However, lack of efficiency has prevented them from being used in practice. One of the roots of this inefficiency is that non-interactive zeroknowledge proofs have been constructed for general NP-complete languages such as Circuit Satisfiability, causing an expensive blowup in the size of the statement when reducing it to a circuit. The contribution of this paper is a general methodology for constructing very simple and efficient non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and non-interactive witness-indistinguishable proofs that work directly for groups with a bilinear map, without needing a reduction to Circuit Satisfiability.\n\nGroups with bilinear maps have enjoyed tremendous success in the field of cryptography in recent years and have been used to construct a plethora of protocols. This paper provides non-interactive witness-indistinguishable proofs and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that can be used in connection with these protocols. Our goal is to spread the use of non-interactive cryptographic proofs from mainly theoretical purposes to the large class of practical cryptographic protocols based on bilinear groups.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University College London", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Jens Groth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Groth:Jens", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit"], "pages": 18}
