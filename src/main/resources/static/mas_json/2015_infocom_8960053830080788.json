Although the best performance can be achieved when a large number of active antennas are placed only in the horizontal domain, BS form factor limitation often makes horizontal array placement infeasible. To cope with this limitation, this article introduces full-dimension MIMO (FD-MIMO) cellular wireless communication system, where active antennas are placed in a 2D grid at BSs. For analysis of the FD-MIMO systems, a 3D spatial channel model is introduced, on which system-level simulations are conducted. The simulation results show that the proposed FD-MIMO system with 32 antenna ports achieves 2-3.6 times cell average throughput gain and 1.5-5 times cell edge throughput gain compared to the 4G LTE system of two antenna ports at the BS.", "citation": "Citations (256)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Cray", "Kyoto University", "Kyoto University", "Kyoto University", "Kyoto University", "Kyoto University", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Stanford University", "University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Picardie Jules Verne", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Picardie Jules Verne", "Electrical Engi ... omputer Science", "Electrical Engi ... omputer Science", "Electrical Engi ... omputer Science", "STMicroelectron ... renoble, France", "STMicroelectron ...
