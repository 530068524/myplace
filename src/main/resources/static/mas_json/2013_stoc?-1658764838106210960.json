In this paper, we generalize the problem to consider values that lie in R m , for m \u2265 1, and present an optimal protocol in regard to fault tolerance. Our scenario is the following. Processes start with values in R m , for m \u2265 1, and communicate via message-passing. The system is  asynchronous : there is no upper bound on processes' relative speeds or on message delay. Some  faulty  processes can display arbitrarily malicious (i.e. Byzantine) behavior. Non-faulty processes must decide on values that are: (1) in R m ; (2) within distance e of each other; and (3) in the convex hull of the non-faulty processes' inputs. We give an algorithm with a matching lower bound on fault tolerance: we require n > t(m+2), where n is the number of processes, t is the number of Byzantine processes, and input and output values reside in R m . Non-faulty processes send O(n 2  d log(m/e max{\u03b4(d): 1 \u2264 d \u2264 m})) messages in total, where \u03b4(d) is the range of non-faulty inputs projected at coordinate d. The Byzantine processes do not affect the algorithm's running time.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Hammurabi Mendes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mendes:Hammurabi", "Maurice Herlihy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herlihy:Maurice"], "pages": 10}
