Different approaches define and applytheir own quality models, which are composed of single metricsor combinations thereof, to operationalize software design. However, single metrics are too fine-grained to identify coredesign flaws and they cannot provide hints for making designimprovements. In order to deal with these weaknesses of metricbasedmodels, rules-based approaches have proven successful inthe realm of source-code quality. Moreover, for developing awell-designed software system, design principles play a key role, as they define fundamental guidelines and help to avoid pitfalls. Therefore, this thesis will enhance and complete a rule-basedquality reference model for operationalizing design principlesand will provide a measuring tool that implements these rules. The validation of the design quality model and the measurementtool will be based on various industrial projects. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative surveys will be conducted in order toget validated results on the value of object-oriented designprinciples for software development.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Johannes Kepler University of Linz"], "authors": ["Johannes Braeuer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braeuer:Johannes"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
