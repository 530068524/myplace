Roughly speaking, two types of data co-exist: historical data and real-time data from which business analysts have to take their decisions in a timely fashion. In this context, the notions of time (application time and transaction time) and traceability turn out to play a crucial role to understand what happened in the company and what is currently happening. Tornado offers a full-fledged platform to deal with such data and is based on two key features: 1) a bi-temporal DB specifically designed for handling historical and real-time data, 2) a GUI that aims to facilitate query formulation for business analysts. In this demonstration, we provide the key resources to let the visitors play with the Tornado functionalities to interact with predefined data.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Lyon", "University of Lyon", "Systar, 171 Rue ... t Cloud, France", "Systar, 171 Rue ... t Cloud, France", "Systar, 171 Rue ... t Cloud, France"], "authors": ["Azhar Ait Ouassarah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouassarah:Azhar_Ait", "Nicolas Aversengy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aversengy:Nicolas", "Xavier Fournety.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fournety:Xavier", "Jean-Marc Petit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petit:Jean=Marc", "Romain Revol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Revol:Romain", "Vasile-Marian Scuturici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scuturici:Vasile=Marian"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
