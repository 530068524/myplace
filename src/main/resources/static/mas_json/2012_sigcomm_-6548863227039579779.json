{"title": "HyperDex: a distributed, searchable key-value store.", "fields": ["scalability", "associative array", "range query", "hash function", "nosql"], "abstract": "Distributed key-value stores are now a standard component of high-performance web services and cloud computing applications. While key-value stores offer significant performance and scalability advantages compared to traditional databases, they achieve these properties through a restricted API that limits object retrieval---an object can only be retrieved by the (primary and only) key under which it was inserted. This paper presents HyperDex, a novel distributed key-value store that provides a unique  search  primitive that enables queries on secondary attributes. The key insight behind HyperDex is the concept of  hyperspace hashing  in which objects with multiple attributes are mapped into a multidimensional hyperspace. This mapping leads to efficient implementations not only for retrieval by primary key, but also for partially-specified secondary attribute searches and range queries. A novel chaining protocol enables the system to achieve strong consistency, maintain availability and guarantee fault tolerance. An evaluation of the full system shows that HyperDex is 12-13x faster than Cassandra and MongoDB for finding partially specified objects. Additionally, HyperDex achieves 2-4x higher throughput for  get / put  operations.", "citation": "Citations (190)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "University of Waterloo", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Robert Escriva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Escriva:Robert", "Bernard Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Bernard", "Emin G\u00fcn Sirer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sirer:Emin_G=uuml=n"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
