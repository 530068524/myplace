Reflectance offers a unique signature of the material but is challenging to measure and use for recognizing materials due to its high-dimensionality. In this work, one-shot reflectance of a material surface which we refer to as a reflectance disk is capturing using a unique optical camera. The pixel coordinates of these reflectance disks correspond to the surface viewing angles. The reflectance has class-specific stucture and angular gradients computed in this reflectance space reveal the material class. These reflectance disks encode discriminative information for efficient and accurate material recognition. We introduce a framework called reflectance hashing that models the reflectance disks with dictionary learning and binary hashing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of reflectance hashing for material recognition with a number of real-world materials.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Drexel University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Hang", "Kristin J.
