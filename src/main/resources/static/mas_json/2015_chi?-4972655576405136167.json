We present the creation of such a tool. We surveyed the most common computer security advice that experts offer to end-users in order to construct a set of Likert scale questions to probe the extent to which respondents claim to follow this advice. Using these questions, we iteratively surveyed a pool of 3,619 computer users to refine our question set such that each question was applicable to a large percentage of the population, exhibited adequate variance between respondents, and had high reliability (i.e., desirable psychometric properties). After performing both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we identified a 16-item scale consisting of four sub-scales that measures attitudes towards choosing passwords, device securement, staying up-to-date, and proactive awareness.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["International Computer Science Institute", "Bar-Ilan University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Serge Egelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egelman:Serge", "Eyal P\u00e9er.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=eacute=er:Eyal"], "pages": 10}
