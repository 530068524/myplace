{"title": "The Hybrid Nested/Hierarchical Dirichlet Process and its Application to Topic Modeling with Word Differentiation.", "fields": ["hierarchical dirichlet process", "discriminative model", "dirichlet process", "markov chain monte carlo", "topic model"], "abstract": "The hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) is a powerful nonparametric Bayesian approach to modeling groups of data which allows the mixture components in each group to be shared. However, in many cases the groups themselves are also in latent groups (categories) which may impact the modeling a lot. In order to utilize the unknown category information of grouped data, we present the hybrid nested/ hierarchical Dirichlet process (hNHDP), a prior that blends the desirable aspects of both the HDP and the nested Dirichlet Process (NDP). Specifically, we introduce a clustering structure for the groups. The prior distribution for each cluster is a realization of a Dirichlet process. Moreover, the set of cluster-specific distributions can share part of atoms between groups, and the shared atoms and specific atoms are generated separately. We apply the hNHDP to document modeling and bring in a mechanism to identify discriminative words and topics. We derive an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme for posterior inference and present experiments on document modeling.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Tengfei Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Tengfei", "Issei Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Issei", "Hiroshi Nakagawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakagawa:Hiroshi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
