Real-time notification pushing on text stream is of practical importance. In this paper, we formulate the real-time pushing on text stream as a sequential decision making problem and propose a Neural Network based Reinforcement Learning (NNRL) algorithm for real-time decision making, e.g., push or skip the incoming text, with considering both history dependencies and future uncertainty. A novel Q-Network which contains a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer and three fully connected neural network layers is designed to maximize the long-term rewards. Experiment results on the real data from TREC 2016 Real-time Summarization track show that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Haihui Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Haihui", "Ziyu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Ziyu", "Wenjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenjie"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
