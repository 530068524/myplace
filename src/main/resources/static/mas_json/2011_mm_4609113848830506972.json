To this end, we propose two distinct approaches which take into consideration known limitations of human visual and haptic perception. We compare both schemes to the state-of-the-art approaches and show that a substantial additional data reduction can be achieved while maintaining good overall haptic and visual performances.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Fernanda Brandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brandi:Fernanda", "Eckehard G.
