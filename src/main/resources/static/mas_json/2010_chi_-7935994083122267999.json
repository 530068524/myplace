Based on fieldwork with 10 families, we designed a new type of embodied digital memento, the FM Radio. It allows families to access and play sonic mementos of their previous holidays. We describe our underlying design motivation where recordings are presented as a series of channels on an old fashioned radio. User feedback suggests that the device met our design goals: being playful and intriguing, easy to use and social. It facilitated family interaction, and allowed ready access to mementos, thus sharing many of the properties of physical mementos that we intended to trigger.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "Microsoft", "University of Sheffield", "Rice University", "University of Sheffield"], "authors": ["Daniela Petrelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrelli:Daniela", "Nicolas Villar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villar:Nicolas", "Vaiva Kalnikait\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalnikait=eacute=:Vaiva", "Lina Dib.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dib:Lina", "Steve Whittaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittaker:Steve"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
