{"title": "Measurement and Modeling of the Origins of Starvation in Congestion Controlled Mesh Networks.", "fields": ["throughput", "default gateway", "mesh networking", "queueing theory", "hop"], "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in understanding the behavior of TCP and congestion-controlled traffic over multi- hop wireless networks. Despite these advances, however, no prior work identified severe throughput imbalances in the basic scenario of mesh networks, in which one-hop flows contend with two-hop flows for gateway access. In this paper, we demonstrate via real network measurements, test-bed experiments, and an analytical model that starvation exists in such a scenario, i.e., the one-hop flow receives most of the bandwidth while the two- hop flow starves. Our analytical model yields a solution consisting of a simple contention window policy that can be implemented via mechanisms in IEEE 802.11e. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate through analysis, experiments, and simulations, that the policy has a powerful effect on network-wide behavior, shifting the network's queuing points, mitigating problematic MAC behavior, and ensuring that TCP flows obtain a fair share of the gateway bandwidth, irrespective of their spatial locations.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Jingpu Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jingpu", "Omer Gurewitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurewitz:Omer", "Vincenzo Mancuso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancuso:Vincenzo", "Joseph Camp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camp:Joseph", "Edward W.
