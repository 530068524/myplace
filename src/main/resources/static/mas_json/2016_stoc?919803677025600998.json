In the polynomial regime of  m = n   s  ,  s >1, the only known solution, originates from (Goldreich, ECCC 2000), is based on  Random Local Functions : Compute  y   i   by applying some fixed (public)  d -ary predicate  P  to a random (public) tuple of distinct inputs ( x   i  1  ,\u2026, x   i   d   ). Our goal in this paper is to understand, for any value of  s , how the pseudorandomness of the resulting sequence depends on the choice of the underlying predicate. We derive the following results:   (1) We show that pseudorandomness against F 2 -linear adversaries (i.e., the distribution  y  has low-bias) is achieved if the predicate is (a)  k =\u03a9( s )-resilience, i.e., uncorrelated with any  k -subset of its inputs, and (b) has algebraic degree of \u03a9( s ) even after fixing \u03a9( s ) of its inputs. We also show that these requirements are necessary, and so they form a tight characterization (up to constants) of security against linear attacks. Our positive result shows that a  d -local low-bias generator can have output length of  n  \u03a9( d ) , answering an open question of Mossel, Shpilka and Trevisan (FOCS, 2003). Our negative result shows that a candidate for pseudorandom generator proposed by the first author (computational complexity, 2015) and by O\u2019Donnell and Witmer (CCC 2014) is insecure. We use similar techniques to refute a conjecture of Feldman, Perkins and Vempala (STOC 2015) regarding the hardness of planted constraint satisfaction problems.   (2) Motivated by the cryptanalysis literature, we consider security against  algebraic attacks . We provide the first theoretical treatment of such attacks by formalizing a general notion of algebraic inversion and distinguishing attacks based on the Polynomial Calculus proof system. We show that algebraic attacks succeed if and only if there exist a degree  e = O ( s ) non-zero polynomial  Q  whose roots cover the roots of  P  or cover the roots of  P \u2019s complement. As a corollary, we obtain the first example of a predicate  P  for which the generated sequence  y  passes all linear tests but fails to pass some polynomial-time computable test, answering an open question posed by the first author (Question\u00a04.9, computational complexity 2015).", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Benny Applebaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Applebaum:Benny", "Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar"], "pages": 14}
