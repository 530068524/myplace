Our technique is based on breaking the full rankings into pairwise comparisons, and then computing parameters that satisfy a set of generalized moment conditions. We identify conditions for the output of GMM to be unique, and identify a general class of consistent and inconsistent breakings. We then show by theory and experiments that our algorithms run significantly faster than the classical Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm, while achieving competitive statistical efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "authors": ["Hossein Azari Soufiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soufiani:Hossein_Azari", "William Z.
