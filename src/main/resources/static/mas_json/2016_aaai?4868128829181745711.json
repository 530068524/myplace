{"title": "Robustness of Bayesian Pool-Based Active Learning Against Prior Misspecification.", "fields": ["lipschitz continuity", "prior probability", "robustness", "bayesian probability", "active learning"], "abstract": "We study the robustness of active learning (AL) algorithms against prior misspecification: whether an algorithm achieves similar performance using a perturbed prior as compared to using the true prior. In both the average and worst cases of the maximum coverage setting, we prove that all \u03b1-approximate algorithms are robust (i.e., near \u03b1-approximate) if the utility is Lipschitz continuous in the prior. We further show that robustness may not be achieved if the utility is non-Lipschitz. This suggests we should use a Lipschitz utility for AL if robustness is required. For the minimum cost setting, we can also obtain a robustness result for approximate AL algorithms. Our results imply that many commonly used AL algorithms are robust against perturbed priors. We then propose the use of a mixture prior to alleviate the problem of prior misspecification. We analyze the robustness of the uniform mixture prior and show experimentally that it performs reasonably well in practice.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Queensland University of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Nguyen Viet Cuong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cuong:Nguyen_Viet", "Nan Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Nan", "Wee Sun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wee_Sun"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
