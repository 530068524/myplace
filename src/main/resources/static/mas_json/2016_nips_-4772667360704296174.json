{"title": "Bayesian Intermittent Demand Forecasting for Large Inventories.", "fields": ["bayesian probability", "inference", "scalability", "demand forecasting", "smoothing"], "abstract": "We present a scalable and robust Bayesian method for demand forecasting in the context of a large e-commerce platform, paying special attention to intermittent and bursty target statistics. Inference is approximated by the Newton-Raphson algorithm, reduced to linear-time Kalman smoothing, which allows us to operate on several orders of magnitude larger problems than previous related work. In a study on large real-world sales datasets, our method outperforms competing approaches on fast and medium moving items.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Amazon.com", "Amazon.com", "Amazon.com"], "authors": ["Matthias W.
