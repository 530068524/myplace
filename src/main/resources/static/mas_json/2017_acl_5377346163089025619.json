Yet statistical parsing has focused almost exclusively on bilexical dependencies or domain-specific logical forms. We propose a neural encoder-decoder transition-based parser which is the first full-coverage semantic graph parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). The model architecture uses stack-based embedding features, predicting graphs jointly with unlexicalized predicates and their token alignments. Our parser is more accurate than attention-based baselines on MRS, and on an additional Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) benchmark, and GPU batch processing makes it an order of magnitude faster than a high-precision grammar-based parser. Further, the 86.69% Smatch score of our MRS parser is higher than the upper-bound on AMR parsing, making MRS an attractive choice as a semantic representation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jan Buys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buys:Jan", "Phil Blunsom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blunsom:Phil"], "pages": 12}
