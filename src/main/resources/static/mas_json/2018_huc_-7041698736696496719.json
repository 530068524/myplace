The microbiome is the group of bacteria, viruses, and cells that live within and on our bodies. This galaxy of particles makes up more than half of the human body and are noted to be responsible for overall health and mood.\n\nFrom nano - micro sensations, Nanogami's dichromic origami fabric seeks to visualize this micro-galaxy with mood sensing, breath monitoring, and inflatable actuation to assist in ideal homeostasis. Within the concept of extimacy, showing the internal states to the external world, the Nanogami illuminates the microbiome to promote awareness with a self monitoring, mediated textile to provoke wellbeing with real-time visual and haptic feedback.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Twente", "University of Twente", "University of Twente", "SENSOREE Therapeutic", "SENSOREE Therapeutic"], "authors": ["Kristin Neidlinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neidlinger:Kristin", "Colin Willson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willson:Colin", "Khiet P.
