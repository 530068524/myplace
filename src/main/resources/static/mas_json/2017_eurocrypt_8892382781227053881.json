A recent paper by Azarderakhsh, Jao, Kalach, Koziel and Leonardi showed that the public keys defined in Jao and De Feo\u2019s original SIDH scheme can be further compressed by around a factor of two, but reported that the performance penalty in utilizing this compression blew the overall SIDH runtime out by more than an order of magnitude. Given that the runtime of SIDH key exchange is currently its main drawback in relation to its lattice- and code-based post-quantum alternatives, an order of magnitude performance penalty for a factor of two improvement in bandwidth presents a trade-off that is unlikely to favor public-key compression in many scenarios.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Waterloo", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Craig Costello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costello:Craig", "David Jao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jao:David", "Patrick Longa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Longa:Patrick", "Michael Naehrig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naehrig:Michael", "Joost Renes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Renes:Joost", "David Urbanik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urbanik:David"], "pages": 28}
