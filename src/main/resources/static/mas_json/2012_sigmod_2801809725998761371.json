{"title": "Differential privacy in data publication and analysis.", "fields": ["differential privacy", "adversary", "information privacy", "privacy by design", "privacy software"], "abstract": "Data privacy has been an important research topic in the security, theory and database communities in the last few decades. However, many existing studies have restrictive assumptions regarding the adversary's prior knowledge, meaning that they preserve individuals' privacy only when the adversary has rather limited background information about the sensitive data, or only uses certain kinds of attacks. Recently,  differential privacy  has emerged as a new paradigm for privacy protection with very conservative assumptions about the adversary's prior knowledge. Since its proposal, differential privacy had been gaining attention in many fields of computer science, and is considered among the most promising paradigms for privacy-preserving data publication and analysis. In this tutorial, we will motivate its introduction as a replacement for other paradigms, present the basics of the differential privacy model from a database perspective, describe the state of the art in differential privacy research, explain the limitations and shortcomings of differential privacy, and discuss open problems for future research.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yin", "Zhenjie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhenjie", "Gerome Miklau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miklau:Gerome", "Marianne Winslett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winslett:Marianne", "Xiaokui Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Xiaokui"], "pages": 6}
