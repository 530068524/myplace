In this tutorial, we give an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques for supporting keyword-based search and exploration on databases. Several topics will be discussed, including query result definition, ranking functions, result generation and top-k query processing, snippet generation, result clustering, result comparison, query cleaning and suggestion, performance optimization, and search quality evaluation. Various data models will be discussed, including relational data, XML data, graph-structured data, data streams, and workflows. Finally we identify the challenges and opportunities for future research to advance the field.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "University of New South Wales", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Yi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Yi", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0011:Wei", "Ziyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ziyang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
