The tool's primary function is to support reuse of client-side features, but it can also be used for feature identification, web application slicing, and generation of usage scenarios, i.e. sequences of user actions that cause the manifestation of application behaviors. The tool is in prototype stage and is accessible through a plug-in to the Firefox browser, but it can also be used as a library from other browsers (e.g. Chrome, Safari, and PhantomJs).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Split", "University of Split", "M\u00e4lardalen University College"], "authors": ["Josip Maras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maras:Josip", "Maja Stula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stula:Maja", "Jan Carlson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carlson:Jan"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
