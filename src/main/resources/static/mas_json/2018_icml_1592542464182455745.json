The reward function depends on the hidden state (or goal) of both agents, so the agents must infer the other players' hidden goals from their observed behavior in order to solve the tasks. We propose a new approach for learning in these domains: Self Other-Modeling (SOM), in which an agent uses its own policy to predict the other agent's actions and update its belief of their hidden state in an online manner. We evaluate this approach on three different tasks and show that the agents are able to learn better policies using their estimate of the other players' hidden states, in both cooperative and adversarial settings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "authors": ["Roberta Raileanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raileanu:Roberta", "Emily Denton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denton:Emily", "Arthur Szlam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szlam:Arthur", "Rob Fergus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fergus:Rob"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
