Users on those sites share content and form various communities based on explicit friendship, shared interest and common user properties. Recently, we proposed SOCIALSCOPE, a three-layered architecture to address the information management challenges in social content sites. In this paper, we focus on the information discovery and the information presentation layers, and describe how our previously proposed language, Jelly [3], is supported in SOCIALSCOPE to build community-centric information exploration applications on social content sites.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Pennsylvania State University", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sihem Amer-Yahia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amer=Yahia:Sihem", "Jian Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jian", "Cong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Cong"], "pages": 6}
