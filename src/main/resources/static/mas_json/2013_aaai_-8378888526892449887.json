We call such an auction a cascade auction. Our analysis suggests that this type of auction may give higher revenues compared to second price auction in cases of collusion.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Uriel Feige.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feige:Uriel", "Gil Kalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalai:Gil", "Moshe Tennenholtz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tennenholtz:Moshe"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
