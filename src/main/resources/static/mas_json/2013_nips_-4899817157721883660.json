{"title": "Error-Minimizing Estimates and Universal Entry-Wise Error Bounds for Low-Rank Matrix Completion.", "fields": ["matrix norm", "mathematical optimization", "low rank approximation", "matrix", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "We propose a general framework for reconstructing and denoising single entries of incomplete and noisy entries. We describe: effective algorithms for deciding if and entry can be reconstructed and, if so, for reconstructing and denoising it; and a priori bounds on the error of each entry, individually. In the noiseless case our algorithm is exact. For rank-one matrices, the new algorithm is fast, admits a highly-parallel implementation, and produces an error minimizing estimate that is qualitatively close to our theoretical and the state-of-the-art Nuclear Norm and OptSpace methods.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University College London", "Free University of Berlin"], "authors": ["Franz J.
