Link quality-based metrics have been shown to significantly outperform the traditional hopcount metric but they have only been evaluated over legacy 802.11a/b/g radios. The new 802.11n standard introduces a number of enhancements at the MAC and PHY layers (MIMO technology, channel bonding, frame aggregation, short guard interval, and more aggressive modulation and coding schemes) marking the beginning of a new generation of 802.11 radios. Our study in a 21-node indoor 802.11n WMN testbed reveals that the gains of link quality-based metrics over the hopcount metric in legacy 802.11 WMNs do not carry over in 802.11n MIMO WMNs. We analyze the causes of this behavior and make recommendations for the design of new routing metrics in 802.11n WMNs.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Ramanujan K.
