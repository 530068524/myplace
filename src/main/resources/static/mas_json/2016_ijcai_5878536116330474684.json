It is often informally related to the field of Satisfiability Modulo Theories. Yet, the exact formal link is obscured as the terminology and concepts used in these two research areas differ. In this paper, we make the link between these two areas precise.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Nebraska Omaha", "University of Nebraska Omaha"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yuliya Lierler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lierler:Yuliya", "Benjamin Susman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Susman:Benjamin"], "pages": 7}
