As we gain more experience with video content, social norms about ownership have evolved accordingly, spelling out what people think is appropriate use of content that is not necessarily their own. We use a series of three studies, each centering on a different genre of recordings, to probe 634 participants' attitudes toward video storage, reuse, and remix; we also question participants about their own experiences with online video. The results allow us to characterize current practice and emerging social norms and to establish the relationship between the two. Hypotheticals borrowed from legal research are used as the primary vehicle for testing attitudes, and for identifying boundaries between socially acceptable and unacceptable behavior.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Catherine C.
