In this paper, we propose to use deep syntactic information for obtaining fine-grained translation rules. A head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) parser is used to obtain the deep syntactic information, which includes a fine-grained description of the syntactic property and a semantic representation of a sentence. We extract fine-grained rules from aligned HPSG tree/forest-string pairs and use them in our tree-to-string and string-to-tree systems. Extensive experiments on large-scale bidirectional Japanese-English translations testified the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xianchao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xianchao", "Takuya Matsuzaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsuzaki:Takuya", "Jun'ichi Tsujii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsujii:Jun=ichi"], "pages": 10}
