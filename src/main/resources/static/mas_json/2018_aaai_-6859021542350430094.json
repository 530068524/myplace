Recently, inspired by quantum theory, a novel Quantum Language Model (QLM) has been proposed for Information Retrieval (IR). In this paper, we aim to broaden the theoretical and practical basis of QLM. We develop a Neural Network based Quantum-like Language Model (NNQLM) and apply it to Question Answering. Specifically, based on word embeddings, we design a new density matrix, which represents a sentence (e.g., a question or an answer) and encodes a mixture of semantic subspaces. Such a density matrix, together with a joint representation of the question and the answer, can be integrated into neural network architectures (e.g., 2-dimensional convolutional neural networks). Experiments on the TREC-QA and WIKIQA datasets have verified the effectiveness of our proposed models.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Tianjin University", "Tianjin University", "Tianjin University", "Tianjin University", "Tianjin University"], "authors": ["Peng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Peng", "Jiabin Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Jiabin", "Zhan Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Zhan", "Benyou Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Benyou", "Liqun Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Liqun", "Dawei Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song_0001:Dawei"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
