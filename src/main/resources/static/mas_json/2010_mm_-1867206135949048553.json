We propose a multi-modal, machine learned approach that combines social, visual and textual signals into a single prediction system. Although each individual user has different motivations for calling a photo a favourite, we show that the textual, visual, and social modalities effectively capture the needs of most active Flickr users.   We use gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) with a mod least squares loss function for the classification of a user's favourite photos, and evaluate the performance of our classifier with respect to the individual modalities and various combinations thereof. By using a combination of the social and visual modalities the GBDT creates a highly effective classifier. The addition of textual features allows us to significantly increase recall, with a slight trade off in precision.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Open University", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Roelof van Zwol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwol:Roelof_van", "Adam Rae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rae:Adam", "Lluis Garcia Pueyo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pueyo:Lluis_Garcia"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
