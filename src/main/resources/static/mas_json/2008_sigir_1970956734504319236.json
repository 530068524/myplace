{"title": "Query dependent ranking using K-nearest neighbor.", "fields": ["learning to rank", "ranking", "ranking svm", "online and offline"], "abstract": "Many ranking models have been proposed in information retrieval, and recently machine learning techniques have also been applied to ranking model construction. Most of the existing methods do not take into consideration the fact that significant differences exist between queries, and only resort to a single function in ranking of documents. In this paper, we argue that it is necessary to employ different ranking models for different queries and onduct what we call query-dependent ranking. As the first such attempt, we propose a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method for query-dependent ranking. We first consider an online method which creates a ranking model for a given query by using the labeled neighbors of the query in the query feature space and then rank the documents with respect to the query using the created model. Next, we give two offline approximations of the method, which create the ranking models in advance to enhance the efficiency of ranking. And we prove a theory which indicates that the approximations are accurate in terms of difference in loss of prediction, if the learning algorithm used is stable with respect to minor changes in training examples. Our experimental results show that the proposed online and offline methods both outperform the baseline method of using a single ranking function.", "citation": "Citations (162)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Microsoft", "Tsinghua University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Xiubo Geng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geng:Xiubo", "Tie-Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tie=Yan", "Tao Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Tao", "Andrew Arnold.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arnold:Andrew", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Hang", "Heung-Yeung Shum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shum:Heung=Yeung"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
