In contrast, we present a data mining system that can work on top of a relational DBMS based on a combination of SQL queries and User-Defined Functions (UDFs), debuking the common perception that SQL is inefficient or inadequate for data mining. We show our system can analyze large data sets significantly faster than external data mining tools. Moreover, our UDF-based algorithms can process a data set in one pass and have linear scalability.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Houston", "University of Houston"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Carlos Ordonez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ordonez_0001:Carlos", "Sasi K.
