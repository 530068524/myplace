{"title": "Prism aftereffects for throwing with a self-avatar in an immersive virtual environment.", "fields": ["throwing", "immersion", "prism adaptation", "clockwise", "visual field"], "abstract": "The use of first-person self-avatars in immersive virtual environments (VEs) has grown over recent years. It is unknown, however, how visual feedback from a self-avatar influences a user's online actions and subsequent calibration of actions within an immersive VE. The current paper uses a prism throwing adaptation paradigm to test the role of a self-avatar arm or full body on action calibration in a VE. Participants' throwing accuracy to a target on the ground was measured first in a normal viewing environment, then with the visual field rotated clockwise about their vertical axis by 17\u00b0 (prism simulation), and then again in the normal viewing environment with the prism distortion removed. Participants experienced either no-avatar, a first-person avatar arm and hand, or a first-person full body avatar during the entire experimental session, in a between-subjects manipulation. Results showed similar throwing error and adaptation during the prism exposure for all conditions, but a reduced aftereffect (displacement with respect to the target in the opposite direction of the prism-exposure) when the avatar arm or full body was present. The results are discussed in the context of how an avatar can provide a visual frame of reference to aid in action calibration.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Vanderbilt University", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "Vanderbilt University", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Bobby Bodenheimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodenheimer:Bobby", "Sarah H.
