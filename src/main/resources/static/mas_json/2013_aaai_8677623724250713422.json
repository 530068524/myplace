Recent work has devised the red-black planning framework, where red variables take the relaxed semantics (accumulating their values), while black variables take the regular semantics. Provided the red variables are chosen so that red-black plan generation is tractable, one can generate such a plan for every search state, and take its length as the heuristic distance estimate. Previous results were not suitable for this purpose because they identified tractable fragments for red-black plan existence, as opposed to red-black plan generation. We identify a new fragment of red-black planning, that fixes this issue. We devise machinery to efficiently generate redblack plans, and to automatically select the red variables. Experiments show that the resulting heuristics can significantly improve over standard delete relaxation heuristics.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Michael Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz_0001:Michael", "J\u00f6rg Hoffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoffmann_0001:J=ouml=rg", "Carmel Domshlak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Domshlak:Carmel"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
