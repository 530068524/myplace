{"title": "Partial Person Re-Identification.", "fields": ["sparse approximation", "computer vision", "pattern recognition", "ambiguity", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We address a new partial person re-identification (re-id) problem, where only a partial observation of a person is available for matching across different non-overlapping camera views. This differs significantly from the conventional person re-id setting where it is assumed that the full body of a person is detected and aligned. To solve this more challenging and realistic re-id problem without the implicit assumption of manual body-parts alignment, we propose a matching framework consisting of 1) a local patch-level matching model based on a novel sparse representation classification formulation with explicit patch ambiguity modelling, and 2) a global part-based matching model providing complementary spatial layout information. Our framework is evaluated on a new partial person re-id dataset as well as two existing datasets modified to include partial person images. The results show that the proposed method outperforms significantly existing re-id methods as well as other partial visual matching methods.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Queen Mary University of London", "Sun Yat-sen University", "NLPR, Inst. of  ...
