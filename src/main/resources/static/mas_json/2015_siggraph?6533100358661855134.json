{"title": "Decomposition of 32 bpp into 16 bpp textures with alpha.", "fields": ["color depth", "rendering", "computer graphics images", "sprite", "video game graphics"], "abstract": "In 2D game graphics, textures are packed into a single texture called a sprite sheet in order to achieve efficient rendering. The sprite sheet can be compressed to save memory by using various compression methods such as block-based compressions and 16 bpp (bits per pixel) tone reduction. These methods are not without some problems, though. Block-based compressions are GPU-dependent, and high-quality compressions such as ASTC [Nystad et al. 2012] are often unavailable on mobile devices. 16 bpp tone reduction--often used with dithering--can create undesirable noise when it is scaled up (Figure 1c).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Nobuki Yoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoda:Nobuki", "Takeo Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Takeo"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
