This is a challenging task as the amount of training data in languages other than English is very limited. Previously proposed multi-lingual approaches typically require to establish a correspondence to English for which powerful classifiers are already available. In contrast, our method does not require such supervision. We leverage large amounts of weakly-supervised data in various languages to train a multi-layer convolutional network and demonstrate the importance of using pre-training of such networks. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on various multi-lingual datasets, including the recent SemEval-2016 sentiment prediction benchmark (Task 4), where we achieved state-of-the-art performance. We also compare the performance of our model trained individually for each language to a variant trained for all languages at once. We show that the latter model reaches slightly worse - but still acceptable - performance when compared to the single language model, while benefiting from better generalization properties across languages.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Google", "SpinningBytes A ... h, Switzerland"], "authors": ["Jan Deriu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deriu:Jan", "Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucchi:Aur=eacute=lien", "Valeria De Luca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luca:Valeria_De", "Aliaksei Severyn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Severyn:Aliaksei", "Simon M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Simon", "Mark Cieliebak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cieliebak:Mark", "Thomas Hofmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofmann:Thomas", "Martin Jaggi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaggi:Martin"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
