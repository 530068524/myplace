In particular, we consider the k-median clustering on stream data arriving at distributed sites which communicate through a routing tree. Distributed clustering on high speed data streams is a challenging task due to limited communication capacity, storage space, and computing power at each site. In this paper, we propose a suite of algorithms for computing (1 + epsiv) -approximate k-median clustering over distributed data streams under three different topology settings: topology-oblivious, height-aware, and path-aware. Our algorithms reduce the maximum per node transmission to  polylog   N  (opposed to Omega( N ) for transmitting the raw data). We have simulated our algorithms on a distributed stream system with both real and synthetic datasets composed of millions of data. In practice, our algorithms are able to reduce the data transmission to a small fraction of the original data. Moreover, our results indicate that the algorithms are scalable with respect to the data volume, approximation factor, and the number of sites.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Kentucky", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Qi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qi", "Jinze Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jinze", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0010:Wei"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
