Previous algorithms for such spatio-temporal security games fail to scale-up and little is known of the computational complexity properties of these problems. This paper provides a novel oracle-based algorithmic framework for a systematic study of different problem variants of computing optimal (minimax) strategies in spatio-temporal security games. Our framework enables efficient computation of a minimax strategy when the problem admits a polynomial-time oracle. Furthermore, for the cases in which efficient oracles are difficult to find, we propose approximations or prove hardness results.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "Duke University", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Haifeng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Haifeng", "Fei Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Fei", "Albert Xin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Albert_Xin", "Vincent Conitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conitzer:Vincent", "Shaddin Dughmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dughmi:Shaddin", "Milind Tambe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tambe:Milind"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
