{"title": "Mode-Seeking on Hypergraphs for Robust Geometric Model Fitting.", "fields": ["data point", "outlier", "hypergraph", "mode", "constraint graph"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel geometric model fitting method, called Mode-Seeking on Hypergraphs (MSH), to deal with multi-structure data even in the presence of severe outliers. The proposed method formulates geometric model fitting as a mode seeking problem on a hypergraph in which vertices represent model hypotheses and hyperedges denote data points. MSH intuitively detects model instances by a simple and effective mode seeking algorithm. In addition to the mode seeking algorithm, MSH includes a similarity measure between vertices on the hypergraph and a \"weight-aware sampling\" technique. The proposed method not only alleviates sensitivity to the data distribution, but also is scalable to large scale problems. Experimental results further demonstrate that the proposed method has significant superiority over the state-of-the-art fitting methods on both synthetic data and real images.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Xiamen University", "Xiamen University", "Xiamen University", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Hanzi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hanzi", "Guobao Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Guobao", "Yan Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan_0001:Yan", "David Suter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suter:David"], "pages": 9}
