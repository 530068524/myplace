In the literature, schemes for accomplishing this efficiently are called Searchable Encryption (SE). They achieve high efficiency with provable security by means of a quantifiable leakage profile. However, the degree to which SE leakage can be exploited by an adversary is not well understood.   To address this, we present a characterization of the leakage profiles of in-the-wild searchable encryption products and SE schemes in the literature, and present attack models based on an adversarial server's prior knowledge. Then we empirically investigate the security of searchable encryption by providing query recovery and plaintext recovery attacks that exploit these leakage profiles. We term these leakage-abuse attacks and demonstrate their effectiveness for varying leakage profiles and levels of server knowledge, for realistic scenarios. Amongst our contributions are realistic active attacks which have not been previously explored.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Cornell University", "Lewis University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["David Cash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cash:David", "Paul Grubbs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grubbs:Paul", "Jason Perry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perry:Jason", "Thomas Ristenpart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ristenpart:Thomas"], "pages": 12}
