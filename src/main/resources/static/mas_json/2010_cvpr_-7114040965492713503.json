It corresponds to learning a weighted similarity metric to satisfy that the weighted similarity between the same labeled images is larger than that between the differently labeled images with largest margin. We formulate the learning problem as a convex quadratic programming and adopt alternating optimization to solve it efficiently. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets validate the approach. The codebook learning improves the performance, in particular in the case where the number of training examples is not sufficient for large size codebook.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "University of Surrey", "University of Surrey"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hongping Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Hongping", "Fei Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Fei", "Krystian Mikolajczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mikolajczyk:Krystian"], "pages": 8}
