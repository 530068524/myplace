The main difficulty in learning hierarchical policies by imitation is that the high level intention structure of the policy, which is often critical for understanding the demonstration, is unobserved. We formulate this problem as active learning of Probabilistic State-Dependent Grammars (PSDGs) from demonstrations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, our approach learns a hierarchical policy by actively selecting demonstrations and using queries to explicate their intentional structure at selected points. Our contributions include a new algorithm for imitation learning of hierarchical policies and principled heuristics for the selection of demonstrations and queries. Experimental results in five different domains exhibit successful learning using fewer queries than a variety of alternatives.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Mandana Hamidi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamidi:Mandana", "Prasad Tadepalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tadepalli:Prasad", "Robby Goetschalckx.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goetschalckx:Robby", "Alan Fern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern:Alan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
