The diffiusion of the innovation is modeled as the dynamics of a coordination game in which the adoption of a common strategy between players has a higher payoff. Classical results in game theory provide a simple condition for the innovation to spread through the network. The present paper characterizes the rate of convergence as a function of graph structure. In particular, we derive a dichotomy between well-connected (e.g. random) graphs that show slow convergence and poorly connected, low dimensional graphs that show fast convergence.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Andrea Montanari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montanari:Andrea", "Amin Saberi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saberi:Amin"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
