In many applications, we may have multiple interrelated domains, some of them with a large amount of training data and others with very little. We often wish to utilize the training data from all these related domains to help improve ranking performance. In this paper, we present a unified model: BayCDR for cross-domain ranking. BayCDR uses a latent space to measure the correlation between different ...", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Jie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Jie", "Wendy Hall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hall:Wendy"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
