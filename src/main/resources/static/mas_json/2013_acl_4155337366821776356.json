{"title": "Aid is Out There: Looking for Help from Tweets during a Large Scale Disaster.", "fields": ["computer science", "computer security"], "abstract": "The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake caused a wide range of problems, and as countermeasures, many aid activities were carried out. Many of these problems and aid activities were reported via Twitter. However, most problem reports and corresponding aid messages were not successfully exchanged between victims and local governments or humanitarian organizations, overwhelmed by the vast amount of information. As a result, victims could not receive necessary aid and humanitarian organizations wasted resources on redundant efforts. In this paper, we propose a method for discovering matches between problem reports and aid messages. Our system contributes to problem-solving in a large scale disaster situation by facilitating communication between victims and humanitarian organizations.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Yamagata University", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Istv\u00e1n Varga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varga:Istv=aacute=n", "Motoki Sano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sano:Motoki", "Kentaro Torisawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torisawa:Kentaro", "Chikara Hashimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashimoto:Chikara", "Kiyonori Ohtake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohtake:Kiyonori", "Takao Kawai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawai:Takao", "Jong-Hoon Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Jong=Hoon", "Stijn De Saeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saeger:Stijn_De"], "pages": 11}
