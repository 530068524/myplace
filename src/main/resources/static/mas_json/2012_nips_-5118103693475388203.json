{"title": "A Polylog Pivot Steps Simplex Algorithm for Classification.", "fields": ["simplex algorithm", "linear fractional programming", "linear classifier", "criss cross algorithm", "big m method"], "abstract": "We present a simplex algorithm for linear programming in a linear classification formulation. The paramount complexity parameter in linear classification problems is called the margin. We prove that for margin values of practical interest our simplex variant performs a polylogarithmic number of pivot steps in the worst case, and its overall running time is near linear. This is in contrast to general linear programming, for which no sub-polynomial pivot rule is known.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad", "Zohar Shay Karnin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karnin:Zohar_Shay"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
