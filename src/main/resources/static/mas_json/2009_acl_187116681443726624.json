{"title": "Learning a Compositional Semantic Parser using an Existing Syntactic Parser.", "fields": ["glr parser", "parser combinator", "syntactic predicate", "recursive descent parser", "compiler compiler"], "abstract": "We present a new approach to learning a semantic parser (a system that maps natural language sentences into logical form). Unlike previous methods, it exploits an existing syntactic parser to produce disambiguated parse trees that drive the compositional semantic interpretation. The resulting system produces improved results on standard corpora on natural language interfaces for database querying and simulated robot control.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ruifang Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Ruifang", "Raymond J.
