{"title": "Memory Fusion Network for Multi-view Sequential Learning.", "fields": ["fusion", "existential quantification", "architecture", "sequence learning", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Multi-view sequential learning is a fundamental problem in machine learning dealing with multi-view sequences. In a multi-view sequence, there exists two forms of interactions between different views: view-specific interactions and cross-view interactions. In this paper, we present a new neural architecture for multi-view sequential learning called the Memory Fusion Network (MFN) that explicitly accounts for both interactions in a neural architecture and continuously models them through time. The first component of the MFN is called the System of LSTMs, where view-specific interactions are learned in isolation through assigning an LSTM function to each view. The cross-view interactions are then identified using a special attention mechanism called the Delta-memory Attention Network (DMAN) and summarized through time with a Multi-view Gated Memory. Through extensive experimentation, MFN is compared to various proposed approaches for multi-view sequential learning on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets. MFN outperforms all the existing multi-view approaches. Furthermore, MFN outperforms all current state-of-the-art models, setting new state-of-the-art results for these multi-view datasets.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Amir Zadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zadeh:Amir", "Paul Pu Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Paul_Pu", "Navonil Mazumder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazumder:Navonil", "Soujanya Poria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poria:Soujanya", "Erik Cambria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cambria:Erik", "Louis-Philippe Morency.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morency:Louis=Philippe"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
