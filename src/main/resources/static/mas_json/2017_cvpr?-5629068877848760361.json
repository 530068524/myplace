{"title": "Residual Expansion Algorithm: Fast and Effective Optimization for Nonconvex Least Squares Problems.", "fields": ["derivative free optimization", "meta optimization", "residual", "multi swarm optimization", "global optimization"], "abstract": "We propose the residual expansion (RE) algorithm: a global (or near-global) optimization method for nonconvex least squares problems. Unlike most existing nonconvex optimization techniques, the RE algorithm is not based on either stochastic or multi-point searches, therefore, it can achieve fast global optimization. Moreover, the RE algorithm is easy to implement and successful in high-dimensional optimization. The RE algorithm exhibits excellent empirical performance in terms of k-means clustering, point-set registration, optimized product quantization, and blind image deblurring.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Daiki Ikami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikami:Daiki", "Toshihiko Yamasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamasaki:Toshihiko", "Kiyoharu Aizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aizawa:Kiyoharu"], "pages": 9}
