Most video segmentation and supervoxel methods output a hierarchy of segmentations, but while this provides useful multiscale information, it also adds difficulty in selecting the appropriate level for a task. In this work, we propose an efficient and robust video segmentation framework based on parametric graph partitioning (PGP), a fast, almost parameter free graph partitioning method that identifies and removes between-cluster edges to form node clusters. Apart from its computational efficiency, PGP performs clustering of the spatio-temporal volume without requiring a pre-specified cluster number or bandwidth parameters, thus making video segmentation more practical to use in applications. The PGP framework also allows processing sub-volumes, which further improves performance, contrary to other streaming video segmentation methods where sub-volume processing reduces performance. We evaluate the PGP method using the SegTrack v2 and Chen Xiph.org datasets, and show that it outperforms related state-of-the-art algorithms in 3D segmentation metrics and running time.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Chen-Ping Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Chen=Ping", "Hieu Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Hieu", "Gregory J.
