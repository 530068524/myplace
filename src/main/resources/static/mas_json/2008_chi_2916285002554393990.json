{"title": "Stane: synthesized surfaces for tactile input.", "fields": ["scratching", "rubbing", "surface finish", "capacitive sensing", "vibration"], "abstract": "Stane  is a hand-held interaction device controlled by tactile input: scratching or rubbing textured surfaces and tapping. The system has a range of sensors, including contact microphones, capacitive sensing and inertial sensing, and provides audio and vibrotactile feedback. The surface textures vary around the device, providing perceivably different textures to the user. We demonstrate that the vibration signals generated by stroking and scratching these surfaces can be reliably classified, and can be used as a very cheaply manufacturable way to control different aspects of interaction. The system is demonstrated as a control for a music player.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "BackToHQ Aps, C ... nhagen, Denmark"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Roderick Murray-Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray=Smith:Roderick", "John Williamson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williamson:John", "Stephen Hughes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hughes:Stephen", "Torben Quaade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quaade:Torben"], "pages": 4}
