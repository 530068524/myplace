{"title": "A Character-level Decoder without Explicit Segmentation for Neural Machine Translation.", "fields": ["phrase", "segmentation", "soft decision decoder", "machine translation", "encoder"], "abstract": "The existing machine translation systems, whether phrase-based or neural, have relied almost exclusively on word-level modelling with explicit segmentation. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: can neural machine translation generate a character sequence without any explicit segmentation? To answer this question, we evaluate an attention-based encoder\u2010 decoder with a subword-level encoder and a character-level decoder on four language pairs\u2010En-Cs, En-De, En-Ru and En-Fi\u2010 using the parallel corpora from WMT\u201915. Our experiments show that the models with a character-level decoder outperform the ones with a subword-level decoder on all of the four language pairs. Furthermore, the ensembles of neural models with a character-level decoder outperform the state-of-the-art non-neural machine translation systems on En-Cs, En-De and En-Fi and perform comparably on En-Ru.", "citation": "Citations (158)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "New York University", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Junyoung Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Junyoung", "Kyunghyun Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Kyunghyun", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua"], "pages": -1}
