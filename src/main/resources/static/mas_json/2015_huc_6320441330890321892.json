However, the development of personalized mobile health feedback systems is still in its infancy. This paper introduces MyBehavior, a smartphone application that takes a novel approach to generate deeply personalized health feedback. It combines state-of-the-art behavior tracking with algorithms that are used in recommendation systems. MyBehavior automatically learns a user's physical activity and dietary behavior and strategically suggests changes to those behaviors for a healthier lifestyle. The system uses a sequential decision making algorithm,  Multi-armed Bandit , to generate suggestions that maximize calorie loss and are easy for the user to adopt. In addition, the system takes into account user's preferences to encourage adoption using the  pareto-frontier  algorithm. In a 14-week study, results show statistically significant increases in physical activity and decreases in food calorie when using MyBehavior compared to a control condition.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Michigan State University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Mashfiqui Rabbi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabbi:Mashfiqui", "Min Hane Aung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aung:Min_Hane", "Mi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Mi", "Tanzeem Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Tanzeem"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
