{"title": "A Calculus of Contracting Processes.", "fields": ["intuitionistic logic", "proof calculus", "theory", "concurrency", "decidability"], "abstract": "We propose a formal theory of contract-based computing. We model contracts as formulae in an intuitionistic logic extended with a \"contractual'' form of implication. Decidability holds for our logic: this allows us to mechanically infer the rights and the duties deriving from any set of contracts. We embed our logic in a core calculus of contracting processes, which combines features from concurrent constraints and calculi for multiparty sessions, while subsuming several idioms for concurrency.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Dipt. di Mat. e ...
