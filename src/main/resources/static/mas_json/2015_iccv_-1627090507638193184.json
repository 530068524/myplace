We build on this intuition to improve multilabel image annotation. Our model uses image metadata nonparametrically to generate neighborhoods of related images using Jaccard similarities, then uses a deep neural network to blend visual information from the image and its neighbors. Prior work typically models image metadata parametrically, in contrast, our nonparametric treatment allows our model to perform well even when the vocabulary of metadata changes between training and testing. We perform comprehensive experiments on the NUS-WIDE dataset, where we show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multilabel image annotation even when our model is forced to generalize to new types of metadata.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Justin Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Justin", "Lamberto Ballan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ballan:Lamberto", "Fei-Fei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fei=Fei"], "pages": 9}
