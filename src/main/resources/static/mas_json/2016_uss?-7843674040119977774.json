As an highlight, we can generate (resp. verify) a non-interactive proof for the SHA-1 circuit in approximately 13ms (resp. 5ms), with a proof size of 444KB. Our techniques are based on the \u201cMPC-in-the-head\u201d approach to zero-knowledge of Ishai et al. (IKOS), which has been successfully used to achieve significant asymptotic improvements. Our contributions include: \u25e6 A thorough analysis of the different variants of IKOS, which highlights their pros and cons for practically relevant soundness parameters; \u25e6 A generalization and simplification of their approach, which leads to faster \u03a3-protocols (that can be made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic) for statements of the form \u201cI know x such that y = \u03c6(x)\u201d (where \u03c6 is a circuit and y a public value); \u25e6 A case study, where we provide explicit protocols, implementations and benchmarking of zero-knowledge protocols for the SHA-1 and SHA-256 circuits.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Irene Giacomelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacomelli:Irene", "Jesper Madsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madsen:Jesper", "Claudio Orlandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orlandi:Claudio"], "pages": 15}
