{"title": "Compiling Constraint Networks into Multivalued Decomposable Decision Graphs.", "fields": ["graph", "theoretical computer science", "compiler", "computer science", "orders of magnitude"], "abstract": "We present and evaluate a top-down algorithm for compiling finite-domain constraint networks (CNs) into the language MDDG of multivalued decomposable decision graphs. Though it includes Decision-DNNF as a proper subset, MDDG offers the same key tractable queries and transformations as Decision-DNNF, which makes it useful for many applications. Intensive experiments showed that our compiler cn2mddg succeeds in compiling CNs which are out of the reach of standard approaches based on a translation of the input network to CNF, followed by a compilation to Decision-DNNF. Furthermore, the sizes of the resulting compiled representations turn out to be much smaller (sometimes by several orders of magnitude).", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Koriche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koriche:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Jean-Marie Lagniez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lagniez:Jean=Marie", "Pierre Marquis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marquis:Pierre", "Samuel Thomas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomas:Samuel"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
