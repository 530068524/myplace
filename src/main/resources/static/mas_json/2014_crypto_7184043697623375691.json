More precisely, we consider p-tampering attackers that may efficiently tamper with each bit of the honest parties\u2019 random tape with probability p, but have to do so in an \u201conline\u201d fashion. Our main result is a strong negative result: We show that any secure encryption scheme, bit commitment scheme, or zero-knowledge protocol can be \u201cbroken\u201d with advantage \\(\\Omega (p)\\) by a p-tampering attacker. The core of this result is a new algorithm for biasing the output of bounded-value functions, which may be of independent interest. We also show that this result cannot be extended to primitives such as signature schemes and identification protocols: assuming the existence of one-way functions, such primitives can be made resilient to Open image in new window -tampering attacks where n is the security parameter.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Academia Sinica", "University of Virginia", "Cornell University", "Google", "Royal Institute of Technology", "Academia Sinica", "University of Virginia", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Per Austrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Austrin:Per", "Kai-Min Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Kai=Min", "Mohammad Mahmoody.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahmoody:Mohammad", "Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael", "Karn Seth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seth:Karn"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2014", "pages": 18}
