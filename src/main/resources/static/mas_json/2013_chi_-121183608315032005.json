Although there are many currently used techniques for designing with children, researchers working in differing contexts and in a changing technological landscape find themselves facing difficult design situations. The FACIT PD framework presented in this paper can aid in choosing existing design techniques or in developing new techniques regardless of the stage in the design cycle, the technology being developed, or philosophical approach to design method. The framework consists of eight dimensions, concerning the design partners, the design goal, and the design technique. The partner dimensions are  partner experience  and  need for accommodation . The design goal dimensions are  design space  and  maturity of design . The technique dimensions include:  cost, portability, technology  and  physical interaction . Three cases will be presented which describe new techniques developed using the framework and two cases will describe existing techniques.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["University of Baltimore", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Greg Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Greg", "Elizabeth Foss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foss:Elizabeth", "Jason C.
