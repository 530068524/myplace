{"title": "Tracking Time-varying Graphical Structure.", "fields": ["heuristic", "machine learning", "generative grammar", "artificial intelligence", "graphical model"], "abstract": "Structure learning algorithms for graphical models have focused almost exclusively on stable environments in which the underlying generative process does not change; that is, they assume that the generating model is globally stationary. In real-world environments, however, such changes often occur without warning or signal. Real-world data often come from generating models that are only locally stationary. In this paper, we present LoSST, a novel, heuristic structure learning algorithm that tracks changes in graphical model structure or parameters in a dynamic, real-time manner. We show by simulation that the algorithm performs comparably to batch-mode learning when the generating graphical structure is globally stationary, and significantly better when it is only locally stationary.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Erich Kummerfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kummerfeld:Erich", "David Danks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danks:David"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
