With this technique, we prove the highest lower bound to date for any explicit problem, namely a lower bound of t q =\u03a9((lg n/lg(wt u )) 2 ). Here n is the number of update operations, w the cell size, t q  the query time and t u  the update time. In the most natural setting of cell size w=\u0398(lg n), this gives a lower bound of t q =\u03a9((lg n/lg lg n) 2 ) for any polylogarithmic update time. This bound is almost a quadratic improvement over the highest previous lower bound of \u03a9(lg n), due to Patrascu and Demaine [SICOMP'06].   We prove our lower bound for the fundamental problem of weighted orthogonal range counting. In this problem, we are to support insertions of two-dimensional points, each assigned a \u0398(lg n)-bit integer weight. A query to this problem is specified by a point q=(x,y), and the goal is to report the sum of the weights assigned to the points dominated by q, where a point (x',y') is dominated by q if x' \u2264 x and y' \u2264 y. In addition to being the highest cell probe lower bound to date, our lower bound is also tight for data structures with update time t u  = \u03a9(lg 2+e n), where e>0 is an arbitrarily small constant.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Aarhus University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Kasper Green Larsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsen:Kasper_Green"], "pages": 10}
