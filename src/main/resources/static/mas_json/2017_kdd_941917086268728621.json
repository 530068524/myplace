Its unique challenges come from the existence of multiple types of nodes and links, which limit the feasibility of the conventional network embedding techniques. We develop two scalable representation learning models, namely  metapath2vec  and  metapath2vec++ . The  metapath2vec  model formalizes meta-path-based random walks to construct the heterogeneous neighborhood of a node and then leverages a heterogeneous skip-gram model to perform node embeddings. The  metapath2vec++  model further enables the simultaneous modeling of structural and semantic correlations in heterogeneous networks. Extensive experiments show that metapath2vec and  metapath2vec++  are able to not only outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as node classification, clustering, and similarity search, but also discern the structural and semantic correlations between diverse network objects.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "departments": ["University of Notre Dame", "University of Notre Dame", "United States Army Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Yuxiao Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Yuxiao", "Nitesh V.
