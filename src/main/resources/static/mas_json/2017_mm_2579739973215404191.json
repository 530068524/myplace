{"title": "Deep Cross-Modality Alignment for Multi-Shot Person Re-IDentification.", "fields": ["computer vision", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Multi-shot person Re-IDentification (Re-ID) has recently received more research attention as its problem setting is more realistic compared to single-shot Re-ID in terms of application. While many large-scale single-shot Re-ID human image datasets have been released, most existing multishot Re-ID video sequence datasets containonly a few (i.e., several hundreds) human instances, which hinders further improvement of multi-shot Re-ID performance. To this end, we propose a deep cross-modality alignment network, which jointly explores both human sequence pairs and image pairs to facilitate training better multi-shot human Re-ID models, i.e., via transferring knowledge from image data to sequence data. To mitigate modality-to-modality mismatch issue, the proposed network is equipped with an image-to-sequence adaption module called cross-modality alignment sub-network, which successfully maps each human image into a pseudo human sequence to facilitate knowledge transferring and joint training. Extensive experimental results on several multi-shot person Re-ID benchmarks demonstrate great performance gain brought up by the proposed network.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Zhichao Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Zhichao", "Bingbing Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Bingbing", "Yichao Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Yichao", "Zhe Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Zhe", "Yi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yi", "Xiaokang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiaokang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
