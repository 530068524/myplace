{"title": "Examining Game World Topology Personalization.", "fields": ["metagaming", "non cooperative game", "screening game", "sequential game", "simultaneous game"], "abstract": "We present an exploratory analysis of the effects of game world topologies on self-reported player experience in Computer Role Playing Games (CRPGs). We find that (a) players are more engaged in game worlds that better match their self-reported preferences; and (b) player preferences for game topology can be predicted based on their in-game behavior. We further describe how in-game behavioral features that correlate to preferences can be used to control procedural content generation algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sauvik Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Sauvik", "Alexander Zook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zook:Alexander", "Mark O.
