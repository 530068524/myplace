For human testers, concurrency makes such code notoriously hard to debug; for automated reasoning, dynamically allocated memory and low-level pointer manipulation poses significant challenges. We present a flexible approach to data race analysis, implemented in the open source Goblint static analysis framework, that combines different pointer and value analyses in order to handle a wide range of locking idioms, including locks allocated dynamically as well as locks stored in arrays. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most ambitious effort, having lasted well over ten years, to create a fully automated static race detection tool that can deal with most of the intricate locking schemes found in Linux device drivers. Our evaluation shows that these analyses are sufficiently precise, but practical use of these techniques requires inferring environmental and domain-specific assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Tartu", "University of Tartu", "University of Tartu", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Tartu"], "authors": ["Vesal Vojdani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vojdani:Vesal", "Kalmer Apinis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apinis:Kalmer", "Vootele R\u00f5tov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=otilde=tov:Vootele", "Helmut Seidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidl:Helmut", "Varmo Vene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vene:Varmo", "Ralf Vogler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogler:Ralf"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
