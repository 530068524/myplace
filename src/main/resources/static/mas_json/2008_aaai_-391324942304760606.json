{"title": "An Analysis of Transformational Analogy: General Framework and Complexity.", "fields": ["implementation", "transformational leadership", "formalism", "general plan", "analogy"], "abstract": "We present TransUCP, a formalism for Transformational Analogy in the context of classical domain-independent planning. TransUCP defines precisely possible plan modification operations for Transformational Analogy and covers a wide range of existing implementations. We use TransUCP to analyze the implications for Transformational Analogy of well-known results about the complexity of general plan adaptation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Lehigh University", "Lehigh University"], "authors": ["Vithal Kuchibatla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuchibatla:Vithal", "H\u00e9ctor Mu\u00f1oz-Avila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mu=ntilde=oz=Avila:H=eacute=ctor"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
