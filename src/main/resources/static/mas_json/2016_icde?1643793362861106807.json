{"title": "DataXFormer: A robust transformation discovery system.", "fields": ["web resource", "data curation", "knowledge base", "data integration", "data mining"], "abstract": "In data integration, data curation, and other data analysis tasks, users spend a considerable amount of time converting data from one representation to another. For example US dates to European dates or airport codes to city names. In a previous vision paper, we presented the initial design of DataXFormer, a system that uses web resources to assist in transformation discovery. Specifically, DataXFormer discovers possible transformations from web tables and web forms and involves human feedback where appropriate. In this paper, we present the full fledged system along with several extensions. In particular, we present algorithms to find (i) transformations that entail multiple columns of input data, (ii) indirect transformations that are compositions of other transformations, (iii) transformations that are not functions but rather relationships, and (iv) transformations from a knowledge base of public data. We report on experiments with a collection of 120 transformation tasks, and show our enhanced system automatically covers 101 of them by using openly available resources.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Ziawasch Abedjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abedjan:Ziawasch", "John Morcos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morcos:John", "Ihab F.
