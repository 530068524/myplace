{"title": "Deep Mean-Shift Priors for Image Restoration.", "fields": ["image restoration", "demosaicing", "bayes estimator", "deblurring", "mean shift"], "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a natural image prior that directly represents a Gaussian-smoothed version of the natural image distribution. We include our prior in a formulation of image restoration as a Bayes estimator that also allows us to solve noise-blind image restoration problems. We show that the gradient of our prior corresponds to the mean-shift vector on the natural image distribution. In addition, we learn the mean-shift vector field using denoising autoencoders, and use it in a gradient descent approach to perform Bayes risk minimization. We demonstrate competitive results for noise-blind deblurring, super-resolution, and demosaicing.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Bern", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Bern", "University of Bern"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Siavash Arjomand Bigdeli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bigdeli:Siavash_Arjomand", "Matthias Zwicker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwicker:Matthias", "Paolo Favaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Favaro:Paolo", "Meiguang Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Meiguang"], "pages": 10}
