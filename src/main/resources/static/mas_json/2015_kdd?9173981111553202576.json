{"title": "Exploiting Data Mining for Authenticity Assessment and Protection of High-Quality Italian Wines from Piedmont.", "fields": ["data mining", "statistical classification", "data science", "profiling", "wine"], "abstract": "This paper discusses the data mining approach followed in a project called TRAQUASwine, aimed at the definition of methods for data analytical assessment of the authenticity and protection, against fake versions, of some of the highest value Nebbiolo-based wines from Piedmont region in Italy. This is a big issue in the wine market, where commercial frauds related to such a kind of products are estimated to be worth millions of Euros. The objective is twofold: to show that the problem can be addressed without expensive and hyper-specialized wine analyses, and to demonstrate the actual usefulness of classification algorithms for data mining on the resulting chemical profiles. Following Wagstaff's proposal for practical exploitation of machine learning (and data mining) approaches, we describe how data have been collected and prepared for the production of different datasets, how suitable classification models have been identified and how the interpretation of the results suggests the emergence of an active role of classification techniques, based on standard chemical profiling, for the assesment of the authenticity of the wines target of the study.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Universita' del ... , Novara, Italy", "Universita' del ... , Novara, Italy", "Universita' del ... ssandria, Italy", "Universita' del ... , Novara, Italy", "Universita' del ... ssandria, Italy"], "authors": ["Marco Arlorio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arlorio:Marco", "Jean Daniel Co\u00efsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Co=iuml=sson:Jean_Daniel", "Giorgio Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Giorgio", "Monica Locatelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Locatelli:Monica", "Luigi Portinale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Portinale:Luigi"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
