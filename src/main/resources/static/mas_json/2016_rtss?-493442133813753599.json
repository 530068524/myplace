{"title": "The Federated Scheduling of Systems of Mixed-Criticality Sporadic DAG Tasks.", "fields": ["fixed priority pre emptive scheduling", "rate monotonic scheduling", "two level scheduling", "multiprocessor scheduling", "fair share scheduling"], "abstract": "Under the federated approach to multiprocessor scheduling, each individual task is either restricted to execute upon a single processor (as in partitioned scheduling), or has exclusive access to all the processors upon which it may execute. The federated scheduling of a mixed-criticality collection of independent recurrent tasks is studied here. A model is proposed for mixed-criticality recurrent tasks that extends the (previously-proposed) implicit-deadline sporadic DAG tasks model to account for mixed criticalities. A federated scheduling algorithm for systems of such tasks is presented and proved correct, and a quantitative evaluation of its efficacy derived via the widely-used speedup factor metric.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Sanjoy Baruah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baruah:Sanjoy"], "pages": 10}
