Our main technical result is that such solution sets have exponentially small correlation, i.e. with the boolean function MOD_q, when m and q are relatively prime. This bound is independent of the number t of equations. This yields progress on limiting the power of constant-depth circuits with modular gates. We derive the first exponential lower bound on the size of depth-three circuits of type having a MAJORITY gate at the top, AND/OR gates at the middle layer and generalized MOD_m gates at the base, computing the function MOD_q. This settles an open problem of Beigel and Maciel (Complexity'97) for the case of such modulus m. Our technique makes use of the work of Bourgain on estimating exponential sums involving a low-degree polynomial and ideas involving matrix rigidity from the work of Grigoriev and Razborov on arithmetic circuits over finite fields.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Institute for Advanced Study", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "authors": ["Arkadev Chattopadhyay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chattopadhyay:Arkadev", "Avi Wigderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigderson:Avi"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
