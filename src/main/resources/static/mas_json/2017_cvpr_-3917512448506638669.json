{"title": "Dynamic Attention-Controlled Cascaded Shape Regression Exploiting Training Data Augmentation and Fuzzy-Set Sample Weighting.", "fields": ["weighting", "training set", "minimum bounding box", "fuzzy set", "model selection"], "abstract": "We present a new Cascaded Shape Regression (CSR) architecture, namely Dynamic Attention-Controlled CSR (DAC-CSR), for robust facial landmark detection on unconstrained faces. Our DAC-CSR divides facial landmark detection into three cascaded sub-tasks: face bounding box refinement, general CSR and attention-controlled CSR. The first two stages refine initial face bounding boxes and output intermediate facial landmarks. Then, an online dynamic model selection method is used to choose appropriate domain-specific CSRs for further landmark refinement. The key innovation of our DAC-CSR is the fault-tolerant mechanism, using fuzzy set sample weighting, for attention-controlled domain-specific model training. Moreover, we advocate data augmentation with a simple but effective 2D profile face generator, and context-aware feature extraction for better facial feature representation. Experimental results obtained on challenging datasets demonstrate the merits of our DAC-CSR over the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "Jiangnan University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhen-Hua Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Zhen=Hua", "Josef Kittler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kittler:Josef", "William J.
