{"title": "Streaming Recommender Systems.", "fields": ["data stream", "recursion", "srec", "recommender system", "data stream mining"], "abstract": "The increasing popularity of real-world recommender systems produces data continuously and rapidly, and it becomes more realistic to study recommender systems under streaming scenarios. Data streams present distinct properties such as temporally ordered, continuous and high-velocity, which poses tremendous challenges to traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of recommendation with stream inputs. In particular, we provide a principled framework termed sRec, which provides explicit continuous-time random process models of the creation of users and topics, and of the evolution of their interests. A variational Bayesian approach called recursive meanfield approximation is proposed, which permits computationally efficient instantaneous on-line inference. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our sRec over other state-of-the-arts.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Michigan State University", "Huawei", "JD.com, Beijing, China"], "authors": ["Shiyu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Shiyu", "Yang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Yang", "Jiliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jiliang", "Dawei Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Dawei", "Yi Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi", "Mark A.
