By using a minimal number of sensor devices, we ensure that the energy expenditure for  sensin g,  computation  and  communication  is minimized (and the lifetime of the network is maximized). We model the intrusion detection (or change detection) problem as a  Markov   decision   process  (MDP). Based on the theory of MDP, we develop the following closed loop  sleep/wake  scheduling algorithms: (1) optimal control of M k+1 , the number of sensors in the wake state in time slot k + 1, (2) optimal control of q k+1 , the probability of a sensor in the wake state in time slot k + 1, and an open loop  sleep/wake  scheduling algorithm which (3) computes q, the optimal probability of a sensor in the wake state (which does not vary with time), based on the sensor observations obtained until time slot k. Our results show that an optimum closed loop control on M k+1  significantly decreases the cost compared to keeping any number of sensors active all the time. Also, among the three algorithms described, we observe that the total cost is minimum for the optimum control on M k+1  and is maximum for the optimum open loop control on q.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Premkumar Karumbu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karumbu:Premkumar", "Anurag Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Anurag"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
