Our main results are (1) we extract $k (k/nd)^{O(1)}$ bits with exponentially small error from $n$-bit sources of min-entropy $k$ that are generated by functions $f : \\{0, 1\\}^\\ell \\to \\{0, 1\\}^n$, where each output bit depends on $\\le d$ input bits. In particular, we extract from $\\mathrm{NC}^0$ sources, corresponding to $d = O(1)$; (2) we extract $k (k/n^{1+\\gamma})^{O(1)}$ bits with superpolynomially small error from $n$-bit sources of min-entropy $k$ that are generated by $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$-size $\\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits, for any $\\gamma > 0$. As our starting point, we revisit the connection by Trevisan and Vadhan [IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE Computer Society, Los Alamitos, CA, 2000, pp. 32--42] between circuit lower bounds and extractors for sources generated by circuits. We note that such extractors (with very weak parameters) are equivalent to lower bounds f...", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Northeastern University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Emanuele Viola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viola:Emanuele"], "pages": 10}
