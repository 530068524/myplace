Prior proof systems for lattice problems were either interactive or leaked knowledge (or both).\n\nOur systems are the first known  NISZK proofs for any cryptographically useful problems that are not related to integer factorization. In addition, they are proofs of knowledge, have reasonable complexity, and generally admit efficient prover algorithms (given appropriate auxiliary input). In some cases, they even imply the first known  interactive statistical zero-knowledge proofs for certain cryptographically important lattice problems.\n\nWe also construct an  NISZK proof for a special kind of disjunction (i.e., OR gate) related to the shortest vector problem. This may serve as a useful tool in potential constructions of noninteractive (computational) zero knowledge proofs for  NP based on lattice assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["SRI International", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris", "Vinod Vaikuntanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaikuntanathan:Vinod"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 18}
