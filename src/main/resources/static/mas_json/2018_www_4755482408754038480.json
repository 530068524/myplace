{"title": "Co-Regularized Deep Multi-Network Embedding.", "fields": ["deep learning", "feature learning", "architecture", "embedding", "schema"], "abstract": "Network embedding aims to learn a low-dimensional vector representation (or embedding) for each node in the social and information networks, with the constraint to preserve network structures. Most existing methods focus on single network embedding, ignoring the relationship between multiple networks. In many real-world applications, however, related multiple networks (e.g., social networks from different platforms) may contain complementary information which can lead to further refined node embeddings. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-network embedding method, DMNE. DMNE is flexible, which allows different networks to have different sizes, to be (un)weighted and (un)directed. It leverages multiple networks via cross-network relationships between nodes in different networks, which may form many-to-many node mappings, and be associated with weights. To model the non-linearity of the network data, we develop DMNE to have a new deep learning architecture, which coordinates multiple neural networks (one for each input network data) with a co-regularized loss function to manipulate cross-network relationships. With multiple layers of non-linear mappings, DMNE progressively transforms each input network into a highly non-linear latent space, and in the meantime, adapts different latent spaces to each other through a co-regularized learning schema. Extensive experimental results on four real-life datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Pennsylvania State University", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Jingchao Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Jingchao", "Shiyu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Shiyu", "Xiao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiao", "Wei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wei", "Haifeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Haifeng", "Dongkuan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Dongkuan", "Xiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Xiang"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
