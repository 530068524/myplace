To model the ISK-RNG, we generalize the PRNG-with-inputs primitive, introduced by Dodis et al. at CCS\u201913 for their /dev/[u]random analysis. The concrete security bounds we uncover tell a mixed story. We find that ISK-RNG lacks backward-security altogether, and that the forward-security bound for the \u201ctruly random\u201d bits fetched by the \\(\\mathtt {RDSEED}\\) instruction is potentially worrisome. On the other hand, we are able to prove stronger forward-security bounds for the pseudorandom bits fetched by the \\(\\mathtt {RDRAND}\\) instruction. En route to these results, our main technical efforts focus on the way in which ISK-RNG employs CBCMAC as an entropy extractor.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Portland State University", "Portland State University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Thomas Shrimpton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrimpton:Thomas", "R.
