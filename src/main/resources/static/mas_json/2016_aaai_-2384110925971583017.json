Given the breadth of domains, there are also a wide variety of representations used for pathfinding, and there are many techniques which have been shown to improve performance. In the last few years, the state-of-the-art in grid-based pathfinding has been significantly improved with domain-specific techniques such as Jump Point Search (JPS), Subgoal Graphs, and Compressed Path Databases. In this paper we look at a specific implementation of the general idea of Geometric Containers, showing that, while it is effective on grid maps, when combined with JPS+ it provides state-of-the-art performance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["DigiPen Institute of Technology", "University of Denver"], "authors": ["Steve Rabin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabin:Steve", "Nathan R.
