Instead, they usually rely a separate model fitting step to generate valid hand poses. Such a post processing is inconvenient and sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a model based deep learning approach that adopts a forward kinematics based layer to ensure the geometric validity of estimated poses. For the first time, we show that embedding such a non-linear generative process in deep learning is feasible for hand pose estimation. Our approach is verified on challenging public datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xingyi Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xingyi", "Qingfu Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Qingfu", "Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0016:Wei", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang", "Yichen Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Yichen"], "pages": 7}
