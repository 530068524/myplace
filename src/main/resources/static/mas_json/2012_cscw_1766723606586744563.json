Cyberinfrastructures endeavor to support \"cutting-edge\" science and must continually evolve and be under development in order to maintain their relevance and usefulness. This qualitative study of a cyberinfrastructure development project to support the new science of metagenomics investigates how sustaining cyberinfrastructure entails continually realigning the relationships among people, technologies, and organizations.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Matthew J.
