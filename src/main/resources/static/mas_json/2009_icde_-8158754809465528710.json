Experimental results demonstrate that iBroker is more efficient and scalable compared to an existing broker for ontology based publish/subscribe systems.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Myung-Jae Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Myung=Jae", "Chin-Wan Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Chin=Wan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
