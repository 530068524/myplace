{"title": "SMIX Live - A Self-Managing Index Infrastructure for Dynamic Workloads.", "fields": ["database index", "agile software development", "granularity", "high memory", "fold"], "abstract": "As databases accumulate growing amounts of data at an increasing rate, adaptive indexing becomes more and more important. At the same time, applications and their use get more agile and flexible, resulting in less steady and less predictable workload characteristics. Being inert and coarse-grained, state-of-the-art index tuning techniques become less useful in such environments. Especially the full-column indexing paradigm results in lot of indexed but never queried data and prohibitively high memory and maintenance costs. In our demonstration, we present Self-Managing Indexes, a novel, adaptive, fine-grained, autonomous indexing infrastructure. In its core, our approach builds on a novel access path that automatically collects useful index information, discards useless index information, and competes with its kind for resources to host its index information. Compared to existing technologies for adaptive indexing, we are able to dynamically grow and shrink our indexes, instead of incrementally enhancing the index granularity. In the demonstration, we visualize performance and system measures for different scenarios and allow the user to interactively change several system parameters.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Thomas Kissinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kissinger:Thomas", "Hannes Voigt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voigt:Hannes", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
