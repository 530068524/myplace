{"title": "Active Learning with Multi-Label SVM Classification.", "fields": ["instance based learning", "instance selection", "cardinality", "semi supervised learning", "active learning"], "abstract": "Multi-label classification, where each instance is assigned to multiple categories, is a prevalent problem in data analysis. However, annotations of multi-label instances are typically more time-consuming or expensive to obtain than annotations of single-label instances. Though active learning has been widely studied on reducing labeling effort for single-label problems, current research on multi-label active learning remains in a preliminary state. In this paper, we first propose two novel multi-label active learning strategies, a max-margin prediction uncertainty strategy and a label cardinality inconsistency strategy, and then integrate them into an adaptive framework of multi-label active learning. Our empirical results on multiple multilabel data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed active instance selection strategies and the integrated active learning approach.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0013:Xin", "Yuhong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yuhong"], "pages": 7}
