{"title": "Adaptive Canonical Correlation Analysis Based On Matrix Manifolds.", "fields": ["change detection", "machine learning", "manifold", "matrix", "canonical correlation"], "abstract": "In this paper, we formulate the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) problem on matrix manifolds. This framework provides a natural way for dealing with matrix constraints and tools for building efficient algorithms even in an adaptive setting. Finally, an adaptive CCA algorithm is proposed and applied to a change detection problem in EEG signals.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Institut national des sciences appliqu\u00e9es de Rouen", "Institut national des sciences appliqu\u00e9es de Rouen", "Institut national des sciences appliqu\u00e9es de Rouen", "Institut national des sciences appliqu\u00e9es de Rouen"], "authors": ["Florian Yger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yger:Florian", "Maxime Berar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berar:Maxime", "Gilles Gasso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gasso:Gilles", "Alain Rakotomamonjy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rakotomamonjy:Alain"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
