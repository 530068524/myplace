More modular non-invasive approaches are unpopular because they entail laborious wrapper code. We propose Cake, a rule-based language describing compositions using  interface relations . To evaluate it, we compare several existing wrappers with reimplemented Cake versions, finding the latter to be simpler and better modularised.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Stephen Kell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kell:Stephen"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2010", "pages": 19}
