Corporations often use this knowledge to modify online interfaces to influence user information disclosure. In this paper, we experimentally test the impact of a norm-shaping design patterns on information divulging behavior. We show that (1) a set of images, biased toward more revealing figures, change subjects' personal views of appropriate information to share; (2) that shifts in perceptions significantly increases the probability that a subject divulges personal information; and (3) that these shift also increases the probability that the subject advises others to do so. Our main contribution is empirically identifying a key mechanism by which norm-shaping designs can change beliefs and subsequent disclosure behaviors.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daphne Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Daphne", "Erin L.
