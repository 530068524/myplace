{"title": "XE (eXtreme Editor) - Bridging the Aspect-Oriented Programming Usability Gap.", "fields": ["comparison of multi paradigm programming languages", "extensible programming", "intentional programming", "protocol", "second generation programming language"], "abstract": "In spite of the modularization benefits supported by the Aspect-Oriented programming paradigm, different usability issues have hindered its adoption. The decoupling between aspect definitions and base code, and the compile-time weaving mechanism adopted by different AOP languages, require developers to manage the consistency between base code and aspect code themselves. These mechanisms create opportunities for errors related to aspect weaving invisibility and non-local control characteristics of AOP languages. This paper describes XE (Extreme Editor), an IDE that supports developers in managing these issues in the functional aspect-oriented programming domain.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Wiwat Ruengmee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruengmee:Wiwat", "Roberto Silveira Silva Filho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filho:Roberto_Silveira_Silva", "Sushil Krishna Bajracharya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bajracharya:Sushil_Krishna", "David F.
