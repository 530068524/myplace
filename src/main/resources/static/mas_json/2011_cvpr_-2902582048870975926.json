We show how to tackle the problem of missing point correspondences heavily required by SfM pipelines and how to go beyond this basic paradigm. We relax the non-linear nature of the problem by accepting two assumptions which surveillance scenarios offer, i.e. the presence of a moving object and easily estimable gravity vector. By those assumptions we cast the problem as a Quadratic Eigenvalue Problem offering an elegant way of treating nonlinear monomials and delivering a quasi closed-form solution as a reliable starting point for a further bundle adjustment. We are the first to bring the closed form solution to such a very practical problem arising in video surveillance. Results in different camera setups demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Austrian Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Branislav Micus\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micus=iacute=k:Branislav"], "pages": 8}
