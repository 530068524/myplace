{"title": "Efficient Estimation of Influence Functions for SIS Model on Social Networks.", "fields": ["diffusion", "graph", "probabilistic logic", "social network", "percolation"], "abstract": "We address the problem of efficiently estimating the influence function of initially activated nodes in a social network under the susceptible/ infected/susceptible (SIS) model, a diffusion model where nodes are allowed to be activated multiple times. The computational complexity drastically increases because of this multiple activation property. We solve this problem by constructing a layered graph from the original social network with each layer added on top as the time proceeds, and applying the bond percolation with a pruning strategy. We show that the computational complexity of the proposed method is much smaller than the conventional naive probabilistic simulation method by a theoretical analysis and confirm this by applying the proposed method to two real world networks.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Ryukoku University", "University of Shizuoka", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Masahiro Kimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimura:Masahiro", "Kazumi Saito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saito:Kazumi", "Hiroshi Motoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motoda:Hiroshi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
