{"title": "CPAchecker: A Tool for Configurable Software Verification.", "fields": ["cpachecker", "program analysis", "verification and validation", "verification", "software verification"], "abstract": "Configurable software verification is a recent concept for expressing different program analysis and model checking approaches in one single formalism. This paper presents CPAchecker, a tool and framework that aims at easy integration of new verification components. Every abstract domain, together with the corresponding operations, implements the interface of configurable program analysis (CPA). The main algorithm is configurable to perform a reachability analysis on arbitrary combinations of existing CPAs. In software verification, it takes a considerable amount of effort to convert a verification idea into actual experimental results -- we aim at accelerating this process. We hope that researchers find it convenient and productive to implement new verification ideas and algorithms using this flexible and easy-to-extend platform, and that it advances the field by making it easier to perform practical experiments. The tool is implemented in Java and runs as command-line tool or as Eclipse plug-in. CPAchecker implements CPAs for several abstract domains. We evaluate the efficiency of the current version of our tool on software-verification benchmarks from the literature, and compare it with other state-of-the-art model checkers. CPAchecker is an open-source toolkit and publicly available.", "citation": "Citations (362)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Dirk Beyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beyer_0001:Dirk", "M.
