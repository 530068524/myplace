{"title": "Online aggregation and continuous query support in MapReduce.", "fields": ["stream processing", "online aggregation", "hop", "event monitoring", "batch processing"], "abstract": "MapReduce is a popular framework for data-intensive distributed computing of batch jobs. To simplify fault tolerance, the output of each MapReduce task and job is  materialized  to disk before it is consumed. In this demonstration, we describe a modified MapReduce architecture that allows data to be  pipelined  between operators. This extends the MapReduce programming model beyond batch processing, and can reduce completion times and improve system utilization for batch jobs as well. We demonstrate a modified version of the Hadoop MapReduce framework that supports  online aggregation , which allows users to see \"early returns\" from a job as it is being computed. Our Hadoop Online Prototype (HOP) also supports  continuous queries , which enable MapReduce programs to be written for applications such as event monitoring and stream processing. HOP retains the fault tolerance properties of Hadoop, and can run unmodified user-defined MapReduce programs.", "citation": "Citations (183)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Tyson Condie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Condie:Tyson", "Neil Conway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conway:Neil", "Peter Alvaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alvaro:Peter", "Joseph M.
