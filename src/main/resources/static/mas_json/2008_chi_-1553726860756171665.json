{"title": "Conversation pivots and double pivots.", "fields": ["conversation", "software", "content management", "online discussion", "perl"], "abstract": "Many sites on the web offer collaborative databases that catalog items such as bands, events, products, or software modules. Conversation pivots allow readers to navigate from pages about these items to conversations about them on the same site or elsewhere on the Internet. Double pivots allow readers to navigate from item pages to pages about other items mentioned in the same conversations. Using text mining techniques specific to the collection it is possible to find references to collected items in online conversations. We implemented conversation pivots for the CPAN archive of Perl modules, and for Drupal.org, the reference site for the Drupal content management system.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Xiaodan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Daniel_Xiaodan", "Nathan Oostendorp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oostendorp:Nathan", "Michael Hess.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hess:Michael", "Paul Resnick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Resnick:Paul"], "pages": 4}
