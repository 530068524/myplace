{"title": "Exploiting GPU peak-power and performance tradeoffs through reduced effective pipeline latency.", "fields": ["exploit", "multithreading", "general purpose computing on graphics processing units", "thread", "power budget"], "abstract": "Modern GPUs share limited hardware resources, such as register files, among a large number of concurrently executing threads. For efficient resource sharing, several buffering and collision avoidance stages are inserted in the GPU pipeline. These additional stages increase the read-after-write (RAW) latencies of instructions. Since GPUs are often architected to hide RAW latencies through extensive multithreading, they typically do not employ power-hungry data-forwarding networks (DFNs). However, we observe that many GPGPU applications do not have enough active threads that are ready to issue instructions to hide these RAW latencies. In this paper, we first demonstrate that DFNs can considerably improve the performance of many compute-intensive GPGPU applications and then propose most recent result forwarding (MoRF) as a low-power alternative to the DFN. Second, for floating-point (FP) operations, we exploit a high-throughput fused multiply-add (HFMA) unit to further reduce both RAW latencies and the number of FMA units in the GPU without impacting instruction throughput. MoRF and HFMA together provide a geometric mean performance improvement of 18% and 29% for integer/single-precision and double-precision GPGPU applications, respectively. Finally, both MoRF and HFMA allow the GPU to effectively mimic a shallower pipeline for a large percentage of instructions. Exploiting such a benefit, we propose low-power pipelines that can reduce peak power consumption by 14% without affecting the performance or increasing the complexity of the forwarding network. The peak power reduction allows GPUs to operate more cores within the same power budget, achieving a geometric mean performance improvement of 33% for double-precision GPGPU applications.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Advanced Micro Devices"], "authors": ["Syed Zohaib Gilani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilani:Syed_Zohaib", "Nam Sung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Nam_Sung", "Michael J.
