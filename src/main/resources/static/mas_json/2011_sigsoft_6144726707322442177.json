Such optimizations are based on dataflow facts which are mostly true, though not always safe. Probabilistic dataflow analysis frameworks infer such facts about a program, while also providing the probability with which a fact is likely to be true. We propose a new Probabilistic Dataflow Analysis Framework which uses path profiles and information about the nesting structure of loops to obtain improved probabilities of dataflow facts.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Arun Ramamurthi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramamurthi:Arun", "Subhajit Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Subhajit", "Y.
