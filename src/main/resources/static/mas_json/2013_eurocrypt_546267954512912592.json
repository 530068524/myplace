The resulting line of research has so far guaranteed security only for adversarially-chosen plaintext distributions that are independent of the public key used by the scheme. In most scenarios, however, it is typically not realistic to assume that adversaries do not take the public key into account when attacking a scheme.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Harvard University", "Google", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Harvard University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ananth Raghunathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghunathan:Ananth", "Gil Segev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segev:Gil", "Salil P.
