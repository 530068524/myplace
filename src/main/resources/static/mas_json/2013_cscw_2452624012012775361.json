We characterize ways in which artifacts underpinned a sense of connection, including by conveying the character of the parental home, supporting a sense of continuity with it, and enabling a physical presence to be maintained there. We then consider how simple affordances offered by these artifacts, such as being able to move, position and sort them, enabled participants to reinforce the meanings that were associated with them. Such actions are normally taken for granted, but we describe how they are compromised for social media especially, due to functional limitations and questions of ownership. We highlight design opportunities for making the transition from home more gradual, and supporting the archiving and display of social media.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Elizabeth S.
