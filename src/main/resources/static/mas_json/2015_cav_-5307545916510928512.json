This work studies buffer insertion under the constraint that the buffers either: (1) avoid blockages or (2) are contained within preassigned buffer bay regions. We propose a general Steiner-tree formulation to drive this application and present a maze-routing-based heuristic that either avoids blockages or finds buffer bays. We show that the combination of our Steiner-tree optimization with leading-edge buffer-insertion techniques leads to effective solutions on industry designs.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "University of Minnesota", "IBM", "GlobalFoundries", "Chang Gung University", "Chang Gung University", "Chang Gung University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Fujitsu", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Charles University in Prague", "Charles University in Prague", "Agricultural Research Service", "Agricultural Research Service", "Agricultural Research Service", "Agricultural Research Service", "Iowa State University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Radu Grigore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grigore:Radu", "Stefan Kiefer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiefer:Stefan"], "pages": 17}
