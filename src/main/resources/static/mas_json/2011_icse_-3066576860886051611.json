In this paper, we present a novel approach that identifies certain groups of code units that potentially share some cross-cutting concerns and recommends them for creating and updating aspects. Those code units, called  concern peers , are detected based on their similar interactions (similar calling relations in similar contexts, either internally or externally). The recommendation is applicable to both the aspectization of non-aspect-oriented programs (i.e. for aspect creation), and the evolution of aspect-oriented programs (i.e. for aspect updating). The empirical evaluation on several real-world software systems shows that our approach is scalable and provides useful recommendations.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Tung Thanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tung_Thanh", "Hung Viet Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hung_Viet", "Hoan Anh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hoan_Anh", "Tien N.
