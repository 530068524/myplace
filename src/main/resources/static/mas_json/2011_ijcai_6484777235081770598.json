{"title": "Constraint Optimization Approach to Context Based Word Selection.", "fields": ["word sense", "machine translation", "semantic similarity", "proper noun", "sentence"], "abstract": "Consistent word selection in machine translation is currently realized by resolving word sense ambiguity through the context of a single sentence or neighboring sentences. However, consistent word selection over the whole article has yet to be achieved. Consistency over the whole article is extremely important when applying machine translation to collectively developed documents like Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose to consider constraints between words in the whole article based on their semantic relatedness and contextual distance. The proposed method is successfully implemented in both statistical and rule-based translators. We evaluate those systems by translating 100 articles in the EnglishWikipedia into Japanese. The results show that the ratio of appropriate word selection for common nouns increased to around 75% with our method, while it was around 55% without our method.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "Kyoto University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jun Matsuno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsuno:Jun", "Toru Ishida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishida_0001:Toru"], "pages": 6}
