But the universe of strategies goes beyond intuitionistic logics and lambda calculus, to capture stateful programs. In this paper we describe a logical counterpart to this extension, in which proofs denote such strategies. We can embed intuitionistic first-order linear logic into this system, as well as an imperative total programming language. The logic makes explicit use of the fact that in the game semantics the exponential can be expressed as a final co algebra. We establish a full completeness theorem for our logic, showing that every bounded strategy is the denotation of a proof.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Bath", "University of Bath", "University of Bath"], "authors": ["Martin Churchill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Churchill:Martin", "James Laird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laird:James", "Guy McCusker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCusker:Guy"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
