In weakly supervised setting, it is commonly observed that trained model overly focuses on discriminative parts rather than the entire object area. Our goal is to overcome this limitation with no additional human intervention by retrieving videos relevant to target class labels from web repository, and generating segmentation labels from the retrieved videos to simulate strong supervision for semantic segmentation. During this process, we take advantage of image classification with discriminative localization technique to reject false alarms in retrieved videos and identify relevant spatio-temporal volumes within retrieved videos. Although the entire procedure does not require any additional supervision, the segmentation annotations obtained from videos are sufficiently strong to learn a model for semantic segmentation. The proposed algorithm substantially outperforms existing methods based on the same level of supervision and is even as competitive as the approaches relying on extra annotations.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "University of Michigan", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Seunghoon Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Seunghoon", "Donghun Yeo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeo:Donghun", "Suha Kwak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwak:Suha", "Honglak Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Honglak", "Bohyung Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Bohyung"], "pages": 9}
