So as to take both pixel-wise and region-wise interactions into consideration when predicting label probabilities for each pixel, we develop a context-aware model based on multiple segmentation to obtain final results. The MIT attention dataset [14] is applied finally to evaluate both new features and model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that figure-ground cues are valid in predicting attention selection, and our proposed model produces improvements over baseline method.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yao Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yao", "Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0016:Wei", "Cheng Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Cheng", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang"], "pages": 8}
