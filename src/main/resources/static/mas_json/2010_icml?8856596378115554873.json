{"title": "Convergence, Targeted Optimality, and Safety in Multiagent Learning.", "fields": ["convergence", "mathematical optimization", "repeated game", "time horizon", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel multiagent learning algorithm, Convergence with Model Learning and Safety (or CMLeS in short), which achieves convergence, targeted optimality against memory-bounded adversaries, and safety, in arbitrary repeated games. The most novel aspect of CMLeS is the manner in which it guarantees (in a PAC sense) targeted optimality against memory-bounded adversaries, via efficient exploration and exploitation. CMLeS is fully implemented and we present empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Doran Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty:Doran", "Peter Stone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stone:Peter"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
