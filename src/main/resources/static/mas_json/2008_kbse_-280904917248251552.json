{"title": "IR-Based Traceability Recovery Processes: An Empirical Comparison of \"One-Shot\" and Incremental Processes.", "fields": ["documentation", "tracing", "traceability", "probabilistic logic", "ranking"], "abstract": "We present the results of a controlled experiment aiming at analysing the role played by the approach adopted during an IR-based traceability recovery process. In particular, we compare the tracing performances achieved by subjects using the \"one-shot\" process, where the full ranked list of candidate links is proposed, and the incremental process, where a similarity threshold is used to cut the ranked list and the links are classified step-by-step. The analysis of the achieved results shows that, in general, the incremental process improves the tracing accuracy and reduces the effort to analyse the proposed links.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["University of Salerno", "University of Salerno", "University of Salerno"], "authors": ["Andrea De Lucia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucia:Andrea_De", "Rocco Oliveto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveto:Rocco", "Genoveffa Tortora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tortora:Genoveffa"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
