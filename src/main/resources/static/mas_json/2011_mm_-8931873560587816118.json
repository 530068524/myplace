{"title": "The FCam API for programmable cameras.", "fields": ["download", "middleware", "multimedia", "architecture", "computational photography"], "abstract": "The FCam API is an open-source camera control library, enabling precise control over a camera's imaging pipeline. Intended for researchers and students in the field of computational photography, it allows easy implementation of novel algorithms and applications. Currently implemented on the Nokia N900 smartphone, and a custom-built \"Frankencamera\", it has been used in teaching at universities around the world, and is freely available for download for the N900. This paper describes the architecture underlying the API, the design of the API itself, several applications built on top of it, and some examples of its use in education.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Google"], "authors": ["Sung Hee Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Sung_Hee", "Andrew Adams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adams:Andrew", "Eino-Ville Talvala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talvala:Eino=Ville"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
