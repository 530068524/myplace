Interview participants reported being highly concerned with  information privacy . At the same time, however, they also reported being significantly less concerned regarding the use of everyday technologies that have the capabilities to collect, process, and disseminate personal information. We present results from this study that both identify and begin to explain this discrepancy.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["David H.
