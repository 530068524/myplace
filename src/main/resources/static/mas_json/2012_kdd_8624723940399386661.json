In this work we introduce the recent temporal pattern mining framework for finding predictive patterns for monitoring and event detection problems in complex multivariate time series data. This framework first converts time series into time-interval sequences of temporal abstractions. It then constructs more complex temporal patterns backwards in time using temporal operators. We apply our framework to health care data of 13,558 diabetic patients and show its benefits by efficiently finding useful patterns for detecting and diagnosing adverse medical conditions that are associated with diabetes.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "Princeton University", "University of Virginia", "Princeton University", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Iyad Batal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Batal:Iyad", "Dmitriy Fradkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fradkin:Dmitriy", "James H.
