First we show that the common Gaussian kernel can only be generalized to a positive definite kernel on a geodesic metric space if the space is flat. As a result, for data on a Riemannian manifold, the geodesic Gaussian kernel is only positive definite if the Riemannian manifold is Euclidean. This implies that any attempt to design geodesic Gaussian kernels on curved Riemannian manifolds is futile. However, we show that for spaces with conditionally negative definite distances the geodesic Laplacian kernel can be generalized while retaining positive definiteness. This implies that geodesic Laplacian kernels can be generalized to some curved spaces, including spheres and hyperbolic spaces. Our theoretical results are verified empirically.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "DTU Compute, Denmark"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Aasa Feragen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feragen:Aasa", "Fran\u00e7ois Lauze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lauze:Fran=ccedil=ois", "S\u00f8ren Hauberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hauberg:S=oslash=ren"], "pages": 11}
