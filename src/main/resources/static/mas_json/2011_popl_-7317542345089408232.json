The design of such a language is made surprisingly subtle by several factors: the relaxed-memory behaviour of the hardware, the effects of compiler optimisation on concurrent code, the need to support high-performance concurrent algorithms, and the desire for a reasonably simple programming model. In turn, this complexity makes verified (or verifying) compilation both essential and challenging.   We define a concurrent relaxed-memory semantics for  ClightTSO , an extension of CompCert's Clight in which the processor's memory model is exposed for high-performance code. We discuss a strategy for verifying compilation from ClightTSO to x86, which we validate with correctness proofs (building on CompCert) for the most interesting compiler phases.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Purdue University", "University of Cambridge", "MPI-SWS, Saarbr ... ecken , Germany"], "authors": ["Jaroslav Sevc\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sevc=iacute=k:Jaroslav", "Viktor Vafeiadis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vafeiadis:Viktor", "Francesco Zappa Nardelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nardelli:Francesco_Zappa", "Suresh Jagannathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jagannathan:Suresh", "Peter Sewell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sewell:Peter"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
