{"title": "A scalable queue for work distribution on GPUs.", "fields": ["queue", "massively parallel", "scalability", "graphics processing unit", "usability"], "abstract": "Harnessing the power of massively parallel devices like the graphics processing unit (GPU) is difficult for algorithms that show dynamic or inhomogeneous workloads. To achieve high performance, such advanced algorithms require scalable, concurrent queues to collect and distribute work. We present a new concurrent work queue, the  Broker Queue , a highly efficient, linearizable queue for fine-granular work distribution on the GPU. We evaluate its usability and benefits in contrast to existing queuing algorithms. Our queue is up to one order of magnitude faster than non-blocking queues, and outperforms simpler queue designs that are unfit for fine-granular work distribution.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Bernhard Kerbl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kerbl:Bernhard", "J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:J=ouml=rg", "Michael Kenzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kenzel:Michael", "Dieter Schmalstieg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmalstieg:Dieter", "Markus Steinberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinberger:Markus"], "pages": 2}
