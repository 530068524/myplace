In spite of many empirical measurements in the literature, we still lack in-depth understanding on how and to what extent different factors contribute to the overall packet losses for a complete stack of protocols at large scale. Specifically, very little is known about: 1) when, where, and under what kind of circumstances packet losses occur; 2) why packets are lost. As a step toward addressing those issues, we deploy a large-scale WSN and design a measurement system for retrieving important system metrics. We propose MAP, a step-by-step methodology to identify the losses, extract system events, and perform spatial-temporal correlation analysis by employing a carefully examined causal graph. MAP enables us to get a closer look at the root causes of packet losses in a low-power ad hoc network. This study validates some earlier conjectures on WSNs and reveals some new findings. The quantitative results also shed lights for future large-scale WSN deployments .", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Wei Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0001:Wei", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Yuan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0004:Yuan", "Tong Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Tong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
