We explore instead the use of Lagrangian relaxation to decouple the two subproblems and solve them separately. While dynamic programming is viable for bigram-based sentence compression, finding optimal compressed trees within graphs is NP-hard. We recover approximate solutions to this problem using LP relaxation and maximum spanning tree algorithms, yielding techniques that can be combined with the efficient bigrambased inference approach using Lagrange multipliers. Experiments show that these approximation strategies produce results comparable to a state-of-the-art integer linear programming formulation for the same joint inference task along with a significant improvement in runtime.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Columbia University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kapil Thadani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thadani:Kapil"], "pages": 11}
