This study aims to generate insights in understanding users' interpersonal privacy concerns by expounding interpersonal privacy boundaries in SNS. Through a case analysis of Friendship Pages on Facebook, this paper identifies users' interpersonal privacy concerns that are rooted from informational norms outlined in the theory of contextual integrity, as well as the tensions that occur within and cross these informational norms. This paper concludes with a discussion of design implications and future research.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Pan Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Pan", "Heng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Heng", "Yunan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yunan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
