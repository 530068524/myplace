It is thus of primordial importance to find the best algorithms that might solve this problem so that concrete parameters can be proposed. The BKW algorithm was proposed by Blum et al. as an algorithm to solve the Learning Parity with Noise problem (LPN), a subproblem of LWE. This algorithm was then adapted to LWE by Albrecht et al.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Alexandre Duc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duc:Alexandre", "Florian Tram\u00e8r.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tram=egrave=r:Florian", "Serge Vaudenay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaudenay:Serge"], "pages": 30}
