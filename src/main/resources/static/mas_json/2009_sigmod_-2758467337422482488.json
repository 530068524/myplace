Understanding the database schema, the hidden relationships among attributes in the data all play an important role in this context. Subscribing to this viewpoint, in this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach, called  Query By Output (QBO) , which can enhance the usability of database systems. The central goal of QBO is as follows: given the output of some query  Q  on a database  D , denoted by  Q ( D ), we wish to construct an alternative query  Q \u2032 such that  Q ( D ) and  Q \u2032 ( D ) are instance-equivalent. To generate instance-equivalent queries from  Q ( D ), we devise a novel data classification-based technique that can handle the  at-least-one semantics  that is inherent in the query derivation. In addition to the basic framework, we design several optimization techniques to reduce processing overhead and introduce a set of criteria to rank order output queries by various notions of utility. Our framework is evaluated comprehensively on three real data sets and the results show that the instance-equivalent queries we obtain are interesting and that the approach is scalable and robust to queries of different selectivities.", "citation": "Citations (121)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Ohio State University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Quoc Trung Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran:Quoc_Trung", "Chee-Yong Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Chee=Yong", "Srinivasan Parthasarathy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parthasarathy_0001:Srinivasan"], "pages": 14}
