{"title": "Selective Labeling via Error Bound Minimization.", "fields": ["regularized least squares", "data point", "gradient descent", "labeled data", "laplace operator"], "abstract": "In many practical machine learning problems, the acquisition of labeled data is often expensive and/or time consuming. This motivates us to study a problem as follows: given a label budget, how to select data points to label such that the learning performance is optimized. We propose a selective labeling method by analyzing the out-of-sample error of Laplacian regularized Least Squares (LapRLS). In particular, we derive a deterministic out-of-sample error bound for LapRLS trained on subsampled data, and propose to select a subset of data points to label by minimizing this upper bound. Since the minimization is a combinational problem, we relax it into continuous domain and solve it by projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Rutgers University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Quanquan Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Quanquan", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Tong", "Chris H.
