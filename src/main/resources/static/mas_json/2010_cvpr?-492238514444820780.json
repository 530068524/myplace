First, we propose a novel symmetric mean-value representation to robustly construct high-quality manifold harmonic bases on nonuniform-sampling meshes. Then, based on the manifold harmonic bases constructed, a novel shape descriptor is presented to capture both of global and local features of 3D shape. This feature descriptor is isometry-invariant, i.e., invariant to rigid-body transformations and non-rigid bending. After characterizing 3D models with the shape features, we perform 3D retrieval with a up-to-date discriminative kernel. This kernel is a dimension-free approach to quantifying the similarity between two unordered featuresets, thus especially suitable for our high-dimensional feature data. Experimental results show that our framework can be effectively used for both comprehensive comparison and partial matching among non-rigid 3D shapes.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "NLPR, CASIA"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Huai-Yu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Huai=Yu", "Hongbin Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongbin", "Tao Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0003:Tao", "Xulei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xulei", "Songde Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Songde"], "pages": 8}
