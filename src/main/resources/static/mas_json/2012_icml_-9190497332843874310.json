{"title": "On causal and anticausal learning.", "fields": ["concept drift", "covariate", "causal model", "transfer of learning", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of function estimation in the case where an underlying causal model can be inferred. This has implications for popular scenarios such as covariate shift, concept drift, transfer learning and semi-supervised learning. We argue that causal knowledge may facilitate some approaches for a given problem, and rule out others. In particular, we formulate a hypothesis for when semi-supervised learning can help, and corroborate it with empirical results.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "authors": ["Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard", "Dominik Janzing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Janzing:Dominik", "Jonas Peters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peters:Jonas", "Eleni Sgouritsa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sgouritsa:Eleni", "Kun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Kun", "Joris M.
