However, the constraints faced in many real domains are more complex. We investigate an important and very general class of problems of maximizing a submodular function subject to general cost constraints, especially focusing on costs coming from route planning. Canonical problems that motivate our framework include mobile robotic sensing, and door-to-door marketing. We propose a generalized cost-benefit (GCB) greedy algorithm for our problem, and prove bi-criterion approximation guarantees under significantly weaker assumptions than those in related literature. Experimental evaluation on realistic mobile sensing and door-to-door marketing problems, as well as using simulated networks, show that our algorithm achieves significantly higher utility than state-of-the-art alternatives, and has either lower or competitive running time.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Vanderbilt University", "Vanderbilt University"], "authors": ["Haifeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haifeng", "Yevgeniy Vorobeychik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vorobeychik:Yevgeniy"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
