However, in many settings, participants lack full access to others' work. Merging the theory of legitimate peripheral participation [18] with Erickson and Kellogg's theory of social translucence [10, 11, 16] we introduce the concept of practice proxies: traces of user participation in online environments that act as resources to orient newcomers towards the norms of practice. Through a combination of virtual [14] and trace ethnography [12] we explore how new users in two online citizen science projects engage with these traces of practice as a way of compensating for a lack of access to the process of the work itself. Our findings suggest that newcomers seek out practice proxies in the social features of the projects that highlight contextualized and specific characteristics of primary work practice.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Syracuse University", "Syracuse University", "Syracuse University", "Syracuse University", "Syracuse University"], "authors": ["Gabriel Mugar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mugar:Gabriel", "Carsten S. \u00d8sterlund.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Oslash=sterlund:Carsten_S=", "Katie DeVries Hassman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassman:Katie_DeVries", "Kevin Crowston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crowston:Kevin", "Corey Brian Jackson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jackson:Corey_Brian"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
