In general, what is the most cost-effective way to learn? To address this question, we introduce  measurements , a general class of mechanisms for providing information about a target model. We present a Bayesian decision-theoretic framework, which allows us to both integrate diverse measurements and choose new measurements to make. We use a variational inference algorithm, which exploits exponential family duality. The merits of our approach are demonstrated on two sequence labeling tasks.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy", "Michael I.
