{"title": "The Design of Assistive Location-based Technologies for People with Ambulatory Disabilities: A Formative Study.", "fields": ["multimedia", "formative assessment", "built environment", "location based service", "participatory design"], "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate how people with mobility impairments assess and evaluate accessibility in the built environment and the role of current and emerging location-based technologies therein. We conducted a three-part formative study with 20 mobility impaired participants: a semi-structured interview (Part 1), a participatory design activity (Part 2), and a design probe activity (Part 3). Part 2 and 3 actively engaged our participants in exploring and designing the future of what we call assistive location-based technologies (ALTs) location-based technologies that specifically incorporate accessibility features to support navigating, searching, and exploring the physical world. Our Part 1 findings highlight how existing mapping tools provide accessibility benefits even though often not explicitly designed for such uses. Findings in Part 2 and 3 help identify and uncover useful features of future ALTs. In particular, we synthesize 10 key features and 6 key data qualities. We conclude with ALT design recommendations.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kotaro Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hara:Kotaro", "Christine Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Christine", "Jon E.
