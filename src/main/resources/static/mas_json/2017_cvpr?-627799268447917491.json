{"title": "Spatial-Semantic Image Search by Visual Feature Synthesis.", "fields": ["image retrieval", "query expansion", "convolutional neural network", "data modeling", "visual word"], "abstract": "The performance of image retrieval has been improved tremendously in recent years through the use of deep feature representations. Most existing methods, however, aim to retrieve images that are visually similar or semantically relevant to the query, irrespective of spatial configuration. In this paper, we develop a spatial-semantic image search technology that enables users to search for images with both semantic and spatial constraints by manipulating concept text-boxes on a 2D query canvas. We train a convolutional neural network to synthesize appropriate visual features that captures the spatial-semantic constraints from the user canvas query. We directly optimize the retrieval performance of the visual features when training our deep neural network. These visual features then are used to retrieve images that are both spatially and semantically relevant to the user query. The experiments on large-scale datasets such as MS-COCO and Visual Genome show that our method outperforms other baseline and state-of-the-art methods in spatial-semantic image search.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Portland State University", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Dartmouth College", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Long Mai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mai:Long", "Hailin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Hailin", "Zhe L.
