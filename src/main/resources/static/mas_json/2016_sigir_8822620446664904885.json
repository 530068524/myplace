{"title": "A Dynamic Recurrent Model for Next Basket Recommendation.", "fields": ["data mining", "computer science", "markov chain", "recurrent neural network", "database transaction"], "abstract": "Next basket recommendation becomes an increasing concern. Most conventional models explore either sequential transaction features or general interests of users. Further, some works treat users' general interests and sequential behaviors as two totally divided matters, and then combine them in some way for next basket recommendation. Moreover, the state-of-the-art models are based on the assumption of Markov Chains (MC), which only capture local sequential features between two adjacent baskets. In this work, we propose a novel model, Dynamic REcurrent bAsket Model (DREAM), based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). DREAM not only learns a dynamic representation of a user but also captures global sequential features among baskets. The dynamic representation of a specific user can reveal user's dynamic interests at different time, and the global sequential features reflect interactions of all baskets of the user over time. Experiment results on two public datasets indicate that DREAM is more effective than the state-of-the-art models for next basket recommendation.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Feng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Feng", "Qiang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0006:Qiang", "Shu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Shu", "Liang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Liang", "Tieniu Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Tieniu"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
