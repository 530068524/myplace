{"title": "Micropayments for Decentralized Currencies.", "fields": ["cryptocurrency", "financial transaction", "micropayment", "lottery", "ledger"], "abstract": "Electronic financial transactions in the US, even those enabled by Bitcoin, have relatively high transaction costs. As a result, it becomes infeasible to make  micropayments , i.e. payments that are pennies or fractions of a penny. In order to circumvent the cost of recording all transactions, Wheeler (1996) and Rivest (1997) suggested the notion of a  probabilistic payment , that is, one implements payments that have  expected  value on the order of micro pennies by running an appropriately biased lottery for a larger payment. While there have been quite a few proposed solutions to such lottery-based micropayment schemes, all these solutions rely on a trusted third party to coordinate the transactions; furthermore, to implement these systems in today's economy would require a a global change to how either banks or electronic payment companies (e.g., Visa and Mastercard) handle transactions.   We put forth a new lottery-based micropayment scheme for any ledger-based transaction system, that can be used today without any change to the current infrastructure. We implement our scheme in a sample web application and show how a single server can handle thousands of micropayment requests per second. We provide an analysis for how the scheme can work at Internet scale.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Cornell University", "U of Virginia,  ... sville, VA, USA"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael", "Abhi Shelat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shelat:Abhi"], "pages": 12}
