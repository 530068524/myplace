{"title": "Informational friend recommendation in social media.", "fields": ["data mining", "ranking", "information retrieval", "collaborative filtering", "social media"], "abstract": "It is well recognized that users rely on social media (e.g. Twitter or Digg) to fulfill two common needs (i.e. social need and informational need) that is to keep in touch with their friends in the real world and to have access to information they are interested in. Traditional friend recommendation methods in social media mainly focus on a user's social need, but seldom address their informational need (i.e. suggesting friends that can provide information one may be interested in but have not been able to obtain so far). In this paper, we propose to recommend friends according to the informational utility, which stands for the degree to which a friend satisfies the target user's unfulfilled informational need, called informational friend recommendation. In order to capture users' informational need, we view a post in social media as an item and utilize collaborative filtering techniques to predict the rating for each post. The candidate friends are then ranked according to their informational utility for recommendation. In addition, we also show how to further consider diversity in such recommendations. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform the traditional friend recommendation methods under informational evaluation measures.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Peking University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Shengxian Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Shengxian", "Yanyan Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Yanyan", "Jiafeng Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jiafeng", "Chaosheng Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Chaosheng", "Xueqi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xueqi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
