In this article, we give a full overview of     practical algebraic effects in the context of a compiled     implementation in the Koka language. In particular, we show how     algebraic effects generalize over common constructs like exception     handling, state, iterators and async-await. We give an effective type     inference algorithm based on extensible effect rows using scoped     labels, and a direct operational semantics. Finally, we show an     efficient compilation scheme to common runtime platforms (like     JavaScript) using a type directed selective CPS translation.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "authors": ["Daan Leijen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leijen:Daan"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
