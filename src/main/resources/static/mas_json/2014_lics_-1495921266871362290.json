More specifically, for formulas in the fragments PLTL \u22c4  and PLTL \u25fb  of the Parametric Linear Temporal Logic of Alur et al., we provide algorithms for computing the limit entropy as all parameters tend to \u221e. As a consequence, we can decide the problem whether the limit entropy of a formula in one of the two fragments coincides with that of its time-unbounded transformation, obtained by replacing each occurrence of a time-bounded operator into its time-unbounded version. The algorithms proceed by translation of the two fragments of PLTL into two classes of discrete-time timed automata and analysis of their strongly-connected components.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Birmingham", "LACL, Universit ...
