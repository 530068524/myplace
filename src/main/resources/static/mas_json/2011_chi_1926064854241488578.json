Prior simulations seek the highest possible fidelity, employing resources to capture concrete characteristics of operating environments. We take a different tack, hypothesizing that a  zero -fidelity approach, focusing on human-centered aspects of work practice, will improve team coordination learning. Such an approach promotes simulation focus by developing an  alternative environment  that stimulates participants to  engage in distributed cognition . The costs of simulation development are reduced.   To supplement preparation for burn training exercises, 28 fire emergency response students played the  Teaching Team Coordination game  (T 2 eC), a zero-fidelity simulation of the distributed cognition of fire emergency response work practice. To test our hypothesis, we develop quantitative evaluation methods for impact on team coordination learning through measures of communication efficiency and cooperative activity. Results show that participants improve cooperation, become more efficient communicators, differentiate team roles through communication, and leverage multiple communication modalities. Given the context of the study amidst the educational process, qualitative data from the students and their expert instructor supports the ecological validity of the contribution of the T 2 eC zero-fidelity simulation to fire emergency response education.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Zachary O.
