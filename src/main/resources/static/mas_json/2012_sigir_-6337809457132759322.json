{"title": "Fighting against web spam: a novel propagation method based on click-through data.", "fields": ["spam and open relay blocking system", "spambot", "forum spam", "trustrank", "spamdexing"], "abstract": "Combating Web spam is one of the greatest challenges for Web search engines. State-of-the-art anti-spam techniques focus mainly on detecting varieties of spam strategies, such as content spamming and link-based spamming. Although these anti-spam approaches have had much success, they encounter problems when fighting against a continuous barrage of new types of spamming techniques. We attempt to solve the problem from a new perspective, by noticing that queries that are more likely to lead to spam pages/sites have the following characteristics: 1) they are popular or reflect heavy demands for search engine users and 2) there are usually few key resources or authoritative results for them. From these observations, we propose a novel method that is based on click-through data analysis by propagating the spamicity score iteratively between queries and URLs from a few seed pages/sites. Once we obtain the seed pages/sites, we use the link structure of the click-through bipartite graph to discover other pages/sites that are likely to be spam. Experiments show that our algorithm is both efficient and effective in detecting Web spam. Moreover, combining our method with some popular anti-spam techniques such as TrustRank achieves improvement compared with each technique taken individually.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Chao Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Chao", "Yiqun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yiqun", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Min", "Shaoping Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shaoping", "Liyun Ru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ru:Liyun", "Kuo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Kuo"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
