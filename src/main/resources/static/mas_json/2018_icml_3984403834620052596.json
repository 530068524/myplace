{"title": "Modeling Sparse Deviations for Compressed Sensing using Generative Models.", "fields": ["generative grammar", "special case", "small number", "generative model", "compressed sensing"], "abstract": "In compressed sensing, a small number of linear measurements can be used to reconstruct an unknown signal. Existing approaches leverage assumptions on the structure of these signals, such as sparsity or the availability of a generative model. A domain-specific generative model can provide a stronger prior and thus allow for recovery with far fewer measurements. However, unlike sparsity-based approaches, existing methods based on generative models guarantee exact recovery only over their support, which is typically only a small subset of the space on which the signals are defined. We propose Sparse-Gen, a framework that allows for sparse deviations from the support set, thereby achieving the best of both worlds by using a domain specific prior and allowing reconstruction over the full space of signals. Theoretically, our framework provides a new class of signals that can be acquired using compressed sensing, reducing classic sparse vector recovery to a special case and avoiding the restrictive support due to a generative model prior. Empirically, we observe consistent improvements in reconstruction accuracy over competing approaches, especially in the more practical setting of transfer compressed sensing where a generative model for a data-rich, source domain aids sensing on a data-scarce, target domain.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Manik Dhar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhar:Manik", "Aditya Grover.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grover:Aditya", "Stefano Ermon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ermon:Stefano"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
