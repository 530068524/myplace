In particular, the input image is represented as a tree of over-segmented regions and the optical flow is estimated by optimizing an energy function defined on such a region-tree using dynamic programming. To accommodate the sampling-inefficiency problem intrinsic to discrete optimization compared to the continuous optimization based methods, both spatial and solution domain coarse-to-fine (C2F) strategies are used. That is, multiple region-trees are built using different over-segmentation granularities. Starting from a global displacement label discretization, optical flow estimation on the coarser level region-tree is used for defining region-wise finer displacement samplings for finer level region-trees. Furthermore, cross-checking based occlusion detection and correction and continuous optimization are also used to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments using the Middlebury benchmark datasets have shown that our proposed method can produce top-ranking results.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Cheng Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Cheng", "Yee-Hong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yee=Hong"], "pages": 8}
