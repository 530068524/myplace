In particular, we consider a semi-random setting where a dataset is chosen arbitrarily from an unknown subspace of low dimension, and then perturbed by full-dimensional Gaussian noise. We design spectral NNS algorithms whose query time depends polynomially on the dimension and logarithmically on the size of the point set. These spectral algorithms use a repeated computation of the top PCA vector/subspace, and are effective even when the random-noise magnitude is much larger than the interpoint distances. Our motivation is that in practice, a number of spectral NNS algorithms outperform the random-projection methods that seem otherwise theoretically optimal on worst-case datasets. In this paper we aim to provide theoretical justification for this disparity.
