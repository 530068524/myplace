{"title": "Online Learning: Random Averages, Combinatorial Parameters, and Learnability.", "fields": ["statistical learning theory", "sample exclusion dimension", "algorithmic learning theory", "active learning", "online machine learning"], "abstract": "We develop a theory of online learning by defining several complexity measures. Among them are analogues of Rademacher complexity, covering numbers and fat-shattering dimension from statistical learning theory. Relationship among these complexity measures, their connection to online learning, and tools for bounding them are provided. We apply these results to various learning problems. We provide a complete characterization of online learnability in the supervised setting.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Alexander Rakhlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rakhlin:Alexander", "Karthik Sridharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sridharan:Karthik", "Ambuj Tewari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tewari:Ambuj"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
