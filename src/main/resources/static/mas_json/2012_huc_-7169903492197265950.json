To this end, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of  FigureEnergy , a novel interactive visualisation that allows users to  annotate  and  manipulate  a graphical representation of their own electricity consumption data, and therefore make sense of their past energy usage and understand when, how, and to what end, some amount of energy was used. To validate our design, we deployed FigureEnergy \"in the wild\" -- 12 participants installed meters in their homes and used the system for a period of two weeks. The results suggest that the annotation approach is successful overall: by engaging with the data users started to relate energy consumption to  activities  rather than just to  appliances . Moreover, they were able to discover that some appliances consume more than they expected, despite having had prior experience of using other electricity displays.", "citation": "Citations (146)", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Enrico Costanza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costanza:Enrico", "Sarvapali D.
