{"title": "A parallel algorithm for global states enumeration in concurrent systems.", "fields": ["correctness", "predicate", "nondeterministic algorithm", "thread", "breadth first search"], "abstract": "Verifying the correctness of the executions of a concurrent program is difficult because of its nondeterministic behavior. One of the verification methods is predicate detection, which predicts whether the user specified condition (predicate) could become true in any global states of the program. The method is predictive because it generates inferred execution paths from the observed execution path and then checks the predicate on the global states of inferred paths. One important part of predicate detection is global states enumeration, which generates the global states on inferred paths. Cooper and Marzullo gave the first enumeration algorithm based on a breadth first strategy (BFS). Later, many algorithms have been proposed to improve space and time complexity. None of them, however, takes parallelism into consideration. In this paper, we present the first parallel and online algorithm, named ParaMount, for global state enumeration. Our experimental results show that ParaMount speeds up the existing sequential algorithms by a factor of 6 with 8 threads. We have implemented an online predicate detector using ParaMount. For predicate detection, our detector based on ParaMount is 10 to 50 times faster than RV runtime (a verification tool that uses Cooper and Marzullo\u2019s BFS enumeration algorithm).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Yen-Jung Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yen=Jung", "Vijay K.
