A similar measure can be derived for other classes of stable outcomes. In this paper, we argue that Pareto optimality can be seen as a notion of stability, and introduce the concept of Price of Pareto Optimality: this is an analogue of the Price of Anarchy, where the maximum is computed over the class of Pareto optimal outcomes, i.e., outcomes that do not permit a deviation by the grand coalition that makes all players weakly better off and some players strictly better off. As a case study, we focus on hedonic games, and provide lower and upper bounds of the Price of Pareto Optimality in three classes of hedonic games: additively separable hedonic games, fractional hedonic games, and modified fractional hedonic games; for fractional hedonic games on trees our bounds are tight.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of L'Aquila"], "authors": ["Edith Elkind.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkind:Edith", "Angelo Fanelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fanelli_0001:Angelo", "Michele Flammini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flammini:Michele"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
