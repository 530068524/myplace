This task has been commonly referred to as \u201ccongealing\u201d in literature. A form of congealing, using a least-squares criteria, has been recently demonstrated to have desirable properties over conventional congealing. Least-squares congealing can be viewed as an extension of the Lucas & Kanade (LK) image alignment algorithm. It is well understood that the alignment performance for the LK algorithm, when aligning a single image with another, is theoretically and empirically equivalent for additive and compositional warps. In this paper we: (i) demonstrate that this equivalence does not hold for the extended case of congealing, (ii) characterize the inherent drawbacks associated with least-squares congealing when dealing with large numbers of images, and (iii) propose a novel method for circumventing these limitations through the application of an inverse-compositional strategy that maintains the attractive properties of the original method while being able to handle very large numbers of images.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Mark Cox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cox:Mark", "Sridha Sridharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sridharan:Sridha", "Simon Lucey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucey:Simon", "Jeffrey F.
