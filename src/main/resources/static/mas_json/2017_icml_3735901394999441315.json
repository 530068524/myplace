We exploit the continuous formulation together with optimal control theory to derive novel adaptive hyper-parameter adjustment policies. Our algorithms have competitive performance with the added benefit of being robust to varying models and datasets. This provides a general methodology for the analysis and design of stochastic gradient algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": [], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Qianxiao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qianxiao", "Cheng Tai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tai:Cheng", "Weinan E.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/E:Weinan"], "pages": 10}
