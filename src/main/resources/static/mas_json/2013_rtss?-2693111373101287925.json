Under normal circumstances it will execute at its normal speed, conditions during run-time may cause it to execute more slowly (but no slower than at its degraded speed). The problem of executing an integrated workload, consisting of some more important components and some less important ones, upon such a varying-speed processor is considered. It is desired that all components execute correctly under normal circumstances, whereas the more important components should execute correctly (although the less important components need not) if the processor runs at any speed no slower than its specified degraded speed.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Sanjoy Baruah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baruah:Sanjoy", "Zhishan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Zhishan"], "pages": 10}
