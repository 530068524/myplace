{"title": "DiffQ: Practical Differential Backlog Congestion Control for Wireless Networks.", "fields": ["cross layer optimization", "throughput", "shared medium", "internet protocol suite", "network congestion"], "abstract": "Congestion control in wireless multi-hop networks is challenging and complicated because of two reasons. First, interference is ubiquitous and causes loss in the shared medium. Second, wireless multihop networks are characterized by the use of diverse and dynamically changing routing paths. Traditional end point based congestion control protocols are ineffective in such a setting resulting in unfairness and starvation. This paper adapts the optimal theoretical work of Tassiulas and Ephremedes on cross-layer optimization of wireless networks involving congestion control, routing and scheduling, for practical solutions to congestion control in multi-hop wireless networks. This work is the first that implements in real off-shelf radios, a differential backlog based MAC scheduling and router-assisted backpressure congestion control for multi-hop wireless networks. Our adaptation, called DiffQ, is implemented between transport and IP and supports legacy TCP and UDP applications. In a network of 46 IEEE 802.11 wireless nodes, we demonstrate that DiffQ far outperforms many previously proposed \"practical\" solutions for congestion control.", "citation": "Citations (182)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Ajit Warrier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Warrier:Ajit", "Sankararaman Janakiraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Janakiraman:Sankararaman", "Sangtae Ha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ha:Sangtae", "Injong Rhee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhee:Injong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
