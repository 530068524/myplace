{"title": "VRCEMIG: A virtual reality system for real time control of electric substations.", "fields": ["immersion", "virtual machine", "joystick", "real time control system", "augmented reality"], "abstract": "This research demonstration presents an integrated hardware and software platform developed for controlling electric substations, through a virtual environment. Each 3D substation is integrated with the supervision, data acquisition and control center of a real electric energy company. Today, this is pursued on a 2D diagram, lacking intuitiveness. VRCEMIG explores techniques to provide deeper immersion and intuitive interactions in order to support not only training for future employees, but also real time operation. During the demonstration visitors will be able to use different devices such as joystick, gamepad and VR glasses to navigate and operate an electric substation (for training purposes only). This substation belongs to the Brazilian company CEMIG, a research partner.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Virtual and Aug ... berl\u00e2ndia (UFU)", "Virtual and Aug ... berl\u00e2ndia (UFU)", "Virtual and Aug ... berl\u00e2ndia (UFU)", "Virtual and Aug ... berl\u00e2ndia (UFU)", "Virtual and Aug ... berl\u00e2ndia (UFU)"], "authors": ["Alexandre Cardoso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cardoso:Alexandre", "Edgard Lamounier Jr......http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lamounier_Jr=:Edgard", "Gerson Lima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lima:Gerson", "Luciene Chagas de Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:Luciene_Chagas_de", "Leandro Mattioli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mattioli:Leandro", "Gesmar Junior.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Junior:Gesmar", "Alexandre Carvalho Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva:Alexandre_Carvalho", "Kenedy Lopes Nogueira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nogueira:Kenedy_Lopes", "Paulo do Prado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prado:Paulo_do", "Jose Newton Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Jose_Newton"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
