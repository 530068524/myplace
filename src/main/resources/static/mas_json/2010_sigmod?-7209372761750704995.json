V iStream  does not only apply innovative multi-query strategies to compute a broad range of popular patterns, such as clusters and outliers, in a highly efficient manner, but it also provides a rich set of visual interfaces and interactions to enable real-time pattern exploration. With ViStream, analysts can easily interact with pattern mining processes by navigating along the time horizons, abstraction levels and parameter spaces, and thus better understand the phenomena of interest.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Di Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Di", "Zhenyu Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Zhenyu", "Zaixian Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Zaixian", "Elke A.
