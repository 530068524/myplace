We start our work from the observation, known in the literature, that shortest path routing creates congested areas in multi- hop wireless networks. These areas are critical-they generate both security and energy efficiency issues. We attack these problems and set out routing in outer space, a new routing mechanism that transforms any shortest path routing protocol (or an approximated version of it) into a new protocol that, in case of uniform traffic, guarantees that every node of the network is responsible for relaying the same number of messages, on expectation. We can show that a network that uses routing in outer space does not have congested areas, does not have the associated security-related issues and does not encourage selfish positioning.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "authors": ["Alessandro Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Alessandro", "Julinda Stefa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefa:Julinda"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
