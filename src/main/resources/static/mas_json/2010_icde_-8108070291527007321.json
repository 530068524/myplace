However, the existing solutions are based on either rigid complex query languages (e.g., SQL, XQuery/XPath) which are hard to use without full schema knowledge, without an expert user, and which require up-front data integration. At the other extreme, existing solutions employ keyword search queries over relational databases [3], [1], [10], [9], [2], [11] as well as over semistructured data [6], [12], [17], [15] which are too imprecise to specify exactly the user's intent [16].", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["IBM", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Andrey Balmin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balmin:Andrey", "Emiran Curtmola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curtmola:Emiran"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
