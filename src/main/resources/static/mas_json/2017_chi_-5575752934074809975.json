However, standard touch interactions, such as dragging to move content, do not scale well to large surfaces and were not designed to support collaboration, such as passing an object around. This paper introduces  CoReach , a set of collaborative gestures that combine input from multiple users in order to manipulate content, facilitate data exchange and support communication. We conducted an observational study to inform the design of  CoReach , and a controlled study showing that it reduced physical fatigue and facilitated collaboration when compared with traditional multi-touch gestures. A final study assessed the value of also allowing input through a handheld tablet to manipulate content from a distance.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University College London", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Can Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Can", "Olivier Chapuis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chapuis:Olivier", "Michel Beaudouin-Lafon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beaudouin=Lafon:Michel", "Eric Lecolinet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lecolinet:Eric"], "pages": 12}
