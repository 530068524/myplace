{"title": "Improving Hierarchical Planning Performance by the Use of Landmarks.", "fields": ["computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In hierarchical planning, landmarks are tasks that occur on every search path leading from the initial plan to a solution. In this work, we present novel domain-independent planning strategies based on such hierarchical landmarks. Our empirical evaluation on four benchmark domains shows that these landmark-aware strategies outperform established search strategies in many cases.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "University of Ulm"], "authors": ["Mohamed Elkawkagy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkawkagy:Mohamed", "Pascal Bercher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bercher:Pascal", "Bernd Schattenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schattenberg:Bernd", "Susanne Biundo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biundo:Susanne"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
