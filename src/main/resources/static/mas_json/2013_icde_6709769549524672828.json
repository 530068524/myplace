In this demo, we present a system to enforce timely and controlled information sharing in emergency situations. The framework is able to detect emergencies, enforce temporary access control policies and obligations to be activated during emergencies, simulate emergency situations for demonstrational purposes and show statistical results related to emergency activation/deactivation and consequent access control policies triggering.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Applied Science Private University", "Applied Science Private University", "Applied Science Private University"], "authors": ["Barbara Carminati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carminati:Barbara", "Elena Ferrari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferrari:Elena", "Michele Guglielmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guglielmi:Michele"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
