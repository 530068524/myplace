We characterize the hardness of the problem by deriving an asymptotic regret bound. We propose the Permutation Minimum Empirical Divergence (PMED) algorithm and derive its asymptotically optimal regret bound. Because of the uncertainty of the position bias, the optimal algorithm for such a problem requires non-convex optimizations that are different from usual partial monitoring and semi-bandit problems. We propose a cutting-plane method and related bi-convex relaxation for these optimizations by using auxiliary variables.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Junpei Komiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komiyama:Junpei", "Junya Honda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Honda:Junya", "Akiko Takeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takeda:Akiko"], "pages": 11}
