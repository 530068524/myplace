{"title": "From relational verification to SIMD loop synthesis.", "fields": ["implementation", "exploit", "program synthesis", "mathematical proof", "simd"], "abstract": "Existing pattern-based compiler technology is unable to effectively exploit the full potential of SIMD architectures. We present a new program synthesis based technique for auto-vectorizing performance critical innermost loops. Our synthesis technique is applicable to a wide range of loops, consistently produces performant SIMD code, and generates correctness proofs for the output code. The synthesis technique, which leverages existing work on relational verification methods, is a novel combination of deductive loop restructuring, synthesis condition generation and a new inductive synthesis algorithm for producing loop-free code fragments. The inductive synthesis algorithm wraps an optimized depth-first exploration of code sequences inside a CEGIS loop. Our technique is able to quickly produce SIMD implementations (up to 9 instructions in 0.12 seconds) for a wide range of fundamental looping structures. The resulting SIMD implementations outperform the original loops by 2.0x-3.7x.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["IMDEA", "IMDEA", "Microsoft", "IMDEA", "IMDEA"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Gilles Barthe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthe:Gilles", "Juan Manuel Crespo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crespo:Juan_Manuel", "Sumit Gulwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gulwani:Sumit", "C\u00e9sar Kunz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunz:C=eacute=sar", "Mark Marron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marron:Mark"], "pages": 12}
