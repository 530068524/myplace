It is commonly used to minimize energies that involve unary, pairwise, and specialized higher-order terms. Our main algorithmic contribution is an extension of ?-expansion that also optimizes \"label costs\" with well-characterized optimality bounds. Label costs penalize a solution based on the set of labels that appear in it, for example by simply penalizing the number of labels in the solution.\n\nOur energy has a natural interpretation as minimizing description length (MDL) and sheds light on classical algorithms like K-means and expectation-maximization (EM). Label costs are useful for multi-model fitting and we demonstrate several such applications: homography detection, motion segmentation, image segmentation, and compression.
