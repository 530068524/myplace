This new model, named continuous stream task model, relaxes some of the constraints imposed by the traditional hard and soft real-time task models. A key advantage of the model is the possibility to easily analyse the probabilistic evolution of the delays. This leads to an easy formalisation of necessary and sufficient conditions for the stochastic stability of the closed loop system producing considerable savings in the amount of CPU bandwidth required to stabilise the system. This fact is confirmed by an extensive set of simulations.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Daniele Fontanelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fontanelli:Daniele", "Luigi Palopoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palopoli:Luigi", "Luca Abeni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abeni:Luca"], "pages": 10}
