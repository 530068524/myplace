{"title": "An innovative approach to better cardiac health through wearable technology.", "fields": ["embedded system", "data analysis", "wearable technology", "smartwatch", "health informatics"], "abstract": "With the wide spread use of wearable technology, particularly smart watches equipped with multiple sensors, we find that smart watches are mainly geared towards fitness advocates in order to help individuals manage and track their respective athletic performance. What is less understood is the under-utilized data analytics potential of wearable technology. Most smart watches presently are making heart rate sensors readily available and commercially affordable. In this paper we explore how we can better utilize smart watch data analytics to further improve an individual's awareness of their cardiac health condition and use this data to potentially facilitate preventative behaviors, with the ultimate goal of this leading to the earlier detection of cardiac diseases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Reem Albaghli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albaghli:Reem", "Urooj Raja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raja:Urooj", "Kenneth M.
