In the streaming model, sketches of input matrices are maintained under updates of matrix entries; we prove results for turnstile updates, given in an arbitrary order. We give the first lower bounds known for the space needed by the sketches, for a given estimation error e. We sharpen prior upper bounds, with respect to combinations of space, failure probability, and number of passes. The sketch we use for matrix A is simply S T A, where S is a sign matrix. Our results include the following upper and lower bounds on the bits of space needed for 1-pass algorithms. Here A is an n x d matrix, B is an n x d' matrix, and c := d+d'. These results are given for fixed failure probability; for failure probability \u03b4>0, the upper bounds require a factor of log(1/\u03b4) more space. We assume the inputs have integer entries specified by O(log(nc)) bits, or O(log(nd)) bits. (Matrix Product) Output matrix C with F(A T B-C) \u2264 e F(A) F(B). We show that \u0398(ce -2 log(nc)) space is needed. (Linear Regression) For d'=1, so that B is a vector b, find x so that Ax-b \u2264 (1+e) min x' \u2208 Real d   Ax'-b. We show that \u0398(d 2 e -1  log(nd)) space is needed. (Rank-k Approximation) Find matrix tA k  of rank no more than k, so that F(A-tA k ) \u2264 (1+e) F{A-A k }, where A k  is the best rank-k approximation to A. Our lower bound is \u03a9(ke -1 (n+d)log(nd)) space, and we give a one-pass algorithm matching this when A is given row-wise or column-wise. For general updates, we give a one-pass algorithm needing [O(ke -2 (n + d/e 2 )log(nd))] space. We also give upper and lower bounds for algorithms using multiple passes, and a sketching analog of the CUR decomposition.", "citation": "Citations (219)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Kenneth L.
