Probabilistic models can be used with KDA to improve its robustness. However, the state of the art of such models could only handle binary class problems, which confines their application in many real world problems. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel nonparametric probabilistic model based on Gaussian Process for KDA to handle multiclass problems. The model provides a novel Bayesian interpretation for KDA, which allows its parameters to be automatically tuned through the optimization of the marginal log-likelihood of the data. Empirical study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Siemens", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Zheng Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zheng", "Liang Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Liang", "Shipeng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Shipeng", "Huan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Huan", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
