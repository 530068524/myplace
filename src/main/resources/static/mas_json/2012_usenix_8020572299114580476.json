In this paper, we show that reconfiguration can be simplified by taking advantage of certain properties commonly provided by Primary/Backup systems. We describe a new reconfiguration protocol, recently implemented in Apache Zookeeper. It fully automates configuration changes and minimizes any interruption in service to clients while maintaining data consistency. By leveraging the properties already provided by Zookeeper our protocol is considerably simpler than state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Microsoft", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Alexander Shraer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shraer:Alexander", "Benjamin Reed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reed:Benjamin", "Dahlia Malkhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malkhi:Dahlia", "Flavio Paiva Junqueira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Junqueira:Flavio_Paiva"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2012", "pages": 13}
