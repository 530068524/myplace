{"title": "Online Learning for Adversaries with Memory: Price of Past Mistakes.", "fields": ["lipschitz continuity", "statistical arbitrage", "convex function", "regret", "regular polygon"], "abstract": "The framework of online learning with memory naturally captures learning problems with temporal effects, and was previously studied for the experts setting. In this work we extend the notion of learning with memory to the general Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework, and present two algorithms that attain low regret. The first algorithm applies to Lipschitz continuous loss functions, obtaining optimal regret bounds for both convex and strongly convex losses. The second algorithm attains the optimal regret bounds and applies more broadly to convex losses without requiring Lipschitz continuity, yet is more complicated to implement. We complement the theoretical results with two applications: statistical arbitrage in finance, and multi-step ahead prediction in statistics.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Oren Anava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anava:Oren", "Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad", "Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie"], "pages": 9}
