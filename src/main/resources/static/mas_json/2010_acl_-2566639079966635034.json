{"title": "Now, Where Was I? Resumption Strategies for an In-Vehicle Dialogue System.", "fields": ["interrupt", "multimedia", "ask price", "computer science"], "abstract": "In-vehicle dialogue systems often contain more than one application, e.g. a navigation and a telephone application. This means that the user might, for example, interrupt the interaction with the telephone application to ask for directions from the navigation application, and then resume the dialogue with the telephone application. In this paper we present an analysis of interruption and resumption behaviour in human-human in-vehicle dialogues and also propose some implications for resumption strategies in an in-vehicle dialogue system.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Gothenburg"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jessica Villing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villing:Jessica"], "pages": 8}
