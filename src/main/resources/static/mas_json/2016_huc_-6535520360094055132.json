The maturity of computer vision (CV) techniques and the ubiquity of smartphone cameras hold promise for offering sub-meter accuracy localization services. However, pure CV-based solutions usually involve hundreds of photos and pre-calibration to construct image database, a labor-intensive overhead for practical deployment. We present  ClickLoc , an accurate, easy-to-deploy, sensor-enriched, image-based indoor localization system. With core techniques rooted in semantic information extraction and optimization-based sensor data fusion,  ClickLoc  is able to bootstrap with few images. Leveraging sensor-enriched photos,  ClickLoc  also enables user localization with a single photo of the surrounding place of interest (POI) with high accuracy and short delay. Incorporating multi-modal localization with Manifold Alignment and Trapezoid Representation,  ClickLoc  not only localizes efficiently, but also provides image-assisted navigation. Extensive experiments in various environments show that the 80-percentile error is within 0.26 m  for POIs on the floor plan, which sheds light on sub-meter level indoor localization.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Tsinghua University", "ETH Zurich", "Princeton University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Han Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Han", "Zheng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Zheng", "Zimu Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zimu", "Longfei Shangguan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shangguan:Longfei", "Ke Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Ke", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
