In this paper, we present such a system based on evaluating the aesthetic quality of consumer photos. The proposed system focuses on photos with faces, which constitute an important part of consumer photo albums. The system has three contributions: 1) We propose an aesthetics-based photo assessment algorithm, by considering different aesthetics-related factors, including the technical characteristics of the photo and the specific features related to faces; 2) Based on the aesthetic measurement, we propose a cropping-based photo editing algorithm, which differs from prior works by eliminating unimportant faces before optimizing photo composition; 3) We also incorporate the aesthetic evaluation with other metrics to select quintessential photos for a large collection of photos. The entire system is delivered by a web interface, which allows users to submit images or albums, and returns promising results for photo evaluation, editing recommendation, and photo selection.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Eastman Kodak Company", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Congcong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Congcong", "Alexander C.
