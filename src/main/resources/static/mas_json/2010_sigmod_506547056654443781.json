{"title": "A demonstration of FlexPref: extensible preference evaluation inside the DBMS engine.", "fields": ["query optimization", "skyline", "database engine", "sargable", "extensibility"], "abstract": "This demonstration presents FlexPref, a framework implemented inside the DBMS query processor that enables efficient and extensible preference query processing. FlexPref provides query processing support  inside  the database engine for a wide-array of preference evaluation methods (e.g., skyline, top-k, k-dominance, k-frequency) in a  single  extensible code base. Integration with FlexPref is simple, involving the registration of only  three  functions that capture the essence of the preference method. Once integrated, the preference method \"lives\" at the core of the database, enabling the efficient execution of preference queries involving common database operations (e.g, selection, join). Functionality of FlexPref, implemented inside PostgreSQL, is demonstrated through the implementation and use of several state-of-the-art preference methods in a real application scenario.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Justin J.
