{"title": "Passive detection of situations from ambient FM-radio signals.", "fields": ["radio wave", "feature extraction", "situation awareness", "transmitter", "simulation"], "abstract": "We introduce a passive system to recognise environmental situations. Differing from other RF-based approaches, our system has the advantage of neither installing a transmitter generating the signal nor equipping the monitored entities with any active component. When activities are performed, it consecutively samples ambient RF-signals, derived from a non-cooperating FM-radio source. Since changes in an environment impact the propagation of radio waves, this data implicitly contains information to distinguish environmental situations. We experimentally demonstrate the distinction of the situations 'empty room', 'opened door' and 'walking person' with an average accuracy of over 90%.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Shuyu Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Shuyu", "Stephan Sigg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sigg:Stephan", "Yusheng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Yusheng"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
