To achieve this, two sets of discriminative hash functions for two different views are learned by simultaneously minimising their distance in the Hamming space, and maximising the cross-covariance and margin. Thus, similar binary codes can be found for images of a same person captured at different views by embedding the images into the Hamming space. Therefore, person re-identification can be solved by efficiently computing and ranking the Hamming distances between the images. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and CBI produces comparable results as state-of-the-art re-identification approaches but is at least 2200 times faster.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "Northumbria University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Feng Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Feng", "Ling Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao_0001:Ling"], "pages": 8}
