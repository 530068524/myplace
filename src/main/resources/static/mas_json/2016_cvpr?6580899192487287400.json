{"title": "Sketch Me That Shoe.", "fields": ["image retrieval", "ranking", "sketch", "training set", "data mining"], "abstract": "We investigate the problem of fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR), where free-hand human sketches are used as queries to perform instance-level retrieval of images. This is an extremely challenging task because (i) visual comparisons not only need to be fine-grained but also executed cross-domain, (ii) free-hand (finger) sketches are highly abstract, making fine-grained matching harder, and most importantly (iii) annotated cross-domain sketch-photo datasets required for training are scarce, challenging many state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. In this paper, for the first time, we address all these challenges, providing a step towards the capabilities that would underpin a commercial sketch-based image retrieval application. We introduce a new database of 1,432 sketchphoto pairs from two categories with 32,000 fine-grained triplet ranking annotations. We then develop a deep tripletranking model for instance-level SBIR with a novel data augmentation and staged pre-training strategy to alleviate the issue of insufficient fine-grained training data. Extensive experiments are carried out to contribute a variety of insights into the challenges of data sufficiency and over-fitting avoidance when training deep networks for finegrained cross-domain ranking tasks.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Qian Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Qian", "Feng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Feng", "Yi-Zhe Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yi=Zhe", "Tao Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Tao", "Timothy M.
