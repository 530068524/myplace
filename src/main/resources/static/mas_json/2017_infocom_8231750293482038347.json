On the contrary, software-defined networks achieve near optimal network performance and policy-based management through per-flow routing and centralized control, which however face scalability challenge due to (1) limited TCAM and on-die memory for storing the forwarding table and (2) per-flow communication/computation overhead at the controller. This paper presents a novel hybrid switching design, which integrates traditional switching and SDN switching for the purpose of achieving both scalability and optimal performance. We show that the integration also leads to unexpected benefits of making both types of switching more efficient under the hybrid design. Numerical evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of hybrid switching when comparing with the state-of-the-art SDN design.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Florida", "University of Science and Technology of China", "School of Compu ... iversity, China"], "authors": ["Hongli Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Hongli", "He Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:He", "Shigang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shigang", "Gongming Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Gongming"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
