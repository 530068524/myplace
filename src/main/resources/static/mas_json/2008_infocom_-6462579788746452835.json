Most of the research in this direction has focused on either random distributions of points, or has assumed simple graph-based models for wireless interference. In this paper, we study capacity estimation problem using the more general Signal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio (SINR) model for interference, on arbitrary wireless networks. The problem becomes much harder in this setting, because of the non-locality of the SINR model. Recent work by Moscibroda et al. (2006) has shown that the throughput in this model can differ from graph based models significantly. We develop polynomial time algorithms to provably approximate the total throughput in this setting.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Bioinformatics Institute", "IBM", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Deepti Chafekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chafekar:Deepti", "V.
