Mathematically, for a given multi-hole domain R, we generate a path P that is provably aperiodic (i.e., any point is covered at most a constant number of times) and dense (i.e., any point of R is arbitrarily close to P). In a discrete setting as in a sensor network, the path visits the nodes with progressive density, which can adapt to the budget of the path length. Given a higher budget, the path covers the network with higher density. With a lower budget the path becomes proportional sparser. We show how this density-adaptive space filling curve can be useful for applications such as serial data fusion, motion planning for data mules, sensor node indexing, and double ruling type in-network data storage and retrieval. We show by simulation results the superior performance of using our algorithm vs standard space filling curves and random walks.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "University of Miami", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Xiaomeng Ban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ban:Xiaomeng", "Mayank Goswami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goswami:Mayank", "Wei Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Wei", "Xianfeng Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Xianfeng", "Jie Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jie"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
