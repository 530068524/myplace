We show that, when tone mapping is approximated by a piecewise constant function, a fast computational scheme is possible requiring computational time similar to the fast implementation of Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC). In fact, the MTM measure can be viewed as a generalization of the NCC for non-linear mappings and actually reduces to NCC when mappings are restricted to be linear. The MTM is shown to be invariant to non-linear tone mappings, and is empirically shown to be highly discriminative and robust to noise.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Haifa", "University of Haifa", "IDC Herzelia, Israel"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yacov Hel-Or.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hel=Or:Yacov", "Hagit Hel-Or.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hel=Or:Hagit", "Eyal David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/David:Eyal"], "pages": 8}
