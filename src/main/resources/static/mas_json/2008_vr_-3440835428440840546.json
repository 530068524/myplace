{"title": "VFire: Virtual Fire in Realistic Environments.", "fields": ["restrict", "immersion", "creative visualization", "data visualization", "comprehension"], "abstract": "The destructive capacity of wildfires and the dangers and limitations associated with observing actual wildfires has led researchers to develop mathematical models in order to better understand their behavior; unfortunately, current two-dimensional visualization techniques make discerning driving forces of a fire difficult and restrict comprehension to the trained eye. VFire is an immersive wildfire visualization application that aims to ameliorate these problems. We discuss several recent enhancements made to VFire in order to not only increase the amount of meaningfully visualized data and visual fidelity but also improve user interaction.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Nevada Univ., Reno", "Nevada Univ., Reno", "Nevada Univ., Reno", "Nevada Univ., Reno", "Nevada Univ., Reno"], "authors": ["Roger V.
