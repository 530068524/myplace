Medical imaging techniques hold the promise of relating cognition to physical activities and brain structures. In a controlled experiment involving 29 participants, we examine code comprehension, code review and prose review using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We find that the neural representations of programming languages vs. natural languages are distinct. We can classify which task a participant is under-taking based solely on brain activity (balanced accuracy 79%,  p   r  = 0.99,  p   r  = \u22120.44,  p  = 0.016) indicating that more skilled participants treat code and prose more similarly at a neural activation level.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Benjamin Floyd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Floyd:Benjamin", "Tyler Santander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santander:Tyler", "Westley Weimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weimer:Westley"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
