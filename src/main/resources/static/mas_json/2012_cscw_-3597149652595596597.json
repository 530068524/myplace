A minority of active contributors does most of the work. While the existence of a core of highly active contributors is well documented, how those individuals came to be so active is less well understood. In this study we extend prior research on TMSP and Wikipedia by examining in detail the characteristics of the revisions that new contributors make. In particular we focus on new users who maintain a minimum level of sustained activity during their first six months. We use content analysis of individual revisions as well as other quantitative techniques to examine three research questions regarding the effect of early diversification of activity, nature vs. nurture, and associations with later administrative and organizational activity. We present analyses that address each of these questions, and conclude with implications for our understanding of the progression of participation on Wikipedia and other TMSP systems.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "University of California, Berkeley", "New York University"], "authors": ["Judd Antin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antin:Judd", "Coye Cheshire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheshire:Coye", "Oded Nov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nov:Oded"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
