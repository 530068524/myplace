{"title": "Joint Recognition and Linking of Fine-Grained Locations from Tweets.", "fields": ["beam search", "world wide web", "labeled data", "structured prediction", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Many users casually reveal their locations such as restaurants, landmarks, and shops in their tweets. Recognizing such fine-grained locations from tweets and then linking the location mentions to well-defined location profiles (e.g., with formal name, detailed address, and geo-coordinates etc.) offer a tremendous opportunity for many applications. Different from existing solutions which perform location recognition and linking as two sub-tasks sequentially in a pipeline setting, in this paper, we propose a novel joint framework to perform location recognition and location linking simultaneously in a joint search space. We formulate this end-to-end location linking problem as a structured prediction problem and propose a beam-search based algorithm. Based on the concept of multi-view learning, we further enable the algorithm to learn from unlabeled data to alleviate the dearth of labeled data. Extensive experiments are conducted to recognize locations mentioned in tweets and link them to location profiles in Foursquare. Experimental results show that the proposed joint learning algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions, and learning from unlabeled data improves both the recognition and linking accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Zongcheng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Zongcheng", "Aixin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Aixin", "Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao", "Jialong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jialong"], "conf": "www", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
