{"title": "Protocol-level hidden server discovery.", "fields": ["anonymity", "server", "child pornography", "network security", "rendezvous"], "abstract": "Tor hidden services are commonly used to provide a TCP based service to users without exposing the hidden server's IP address in order to achieve anonymity and anti-censorship. However, hidden services are currently abused in various ways. Illegal content such as child pornography has been discovered on various Tor hidden servers. In this paper, we propose a protocollevel hidden server discovery approach to locate the Tor hidden server that hosts the illegal website. We investigate the Tor hidden server protocol and develop a hidden server discovery system, which consists of a Tor client, a Tor rendezvous point, and several Tor entry onion routers. We manipulate Tor cells, the basic transmission unit over Tor, at the Tor rendezvous point to generate a protocol-level feature at the entry onion routers. Once our controlled entry onion routers detect such a feature, we can confirm the IP address of the hidden server. We conduct extensive analysis and experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Southeast University", "Southeast University", "University of Victoria", "University of Massachusetts Lowell"], "authors": ["Zhen Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Zhen", "Junzhou Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Junzhou", "Kui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Kui", "Xinwen Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Xinwen"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
