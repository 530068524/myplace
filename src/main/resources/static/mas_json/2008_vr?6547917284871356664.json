Hand of god (HOG) on a world in miniature (WIM) is the first collaborative WIM. It enables a table-top display user to collaborate with a virtual reality (VR) user. The tabletop display user has a god's eye view of the virtual world and communicates with the VR user through natural gestures and speech. The VR user controls a WIM to navigate and manipulate the virtual world with the aid of the tabletop display user's guidance.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia"], "authors": ["Aaron Stafford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stafford:Aaron", "Wayne Piekarski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piekarski:Wayne", "Bruce H.
