The game includes different types of players, accounting for the heterogeneity of ASs in the Internet. We incorporate reliability considerations in the player's utility function, and analyze static properties of the game as well as its dynamic evolution. We provide dynamic analysis of topological quantities, and explain the prevalence of some \u201cnetwork motifs\u201d in the Internet graph. We assess our predictions with real-world data.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Eli A.
