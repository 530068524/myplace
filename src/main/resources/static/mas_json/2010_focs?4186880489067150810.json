{"title": "Hardness of Finding Independent Sets in Almost 3-Colorable Graphs.", "fields": ["hardness of approximation", "graph coloring", "vertex", "integer", "path graph"], "abstract": "We show that for any eps > 0, and positive integers k and q such that q >= 2k + 1, given a graph on N vertices that has a q-colorable induced sub graph of (1 - eps)N vertices, it is NP-hard to find an independent set of N/q^{k+1} vertices. This substantially improves upon the work of Dinur et al. [DKPS] who gave a corresponding bound of N/q^2. Our result implies that for any positive integer k, given a graph that has an independent set of approx (2^k + 1)^{-1} fraction of vertices, it is NP-hard to find an independent set of (2k + 1)^{(k+1)} fraction of vertices. This improves on the previous work of Engebretsen and Holmerin [EH] who proved a gap of 2^{-k} vs 2^{-{k choose 2}}, which is best possible using techniques (including those of [EH]) based on the query efficient PCP of Samorodnitsky and Trevisan [3].", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "New York University", "New York University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Irit Dinur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinur:Irit", "Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash", "Will Perkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perkins:Will", "Muli Safra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Safra:Muli"], "pages": 10}
