{"title": "Information Retrieval Model using Generalized Pareto Distribution and Its Application to Instance Search.", "fields": ["divergence", "generalized pareto distribution", "divergence from randomness model", "extreme value theory", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "We adopt the generalized Pareto distribution for the information-based model and show that the parameters can be estimated based on the mean excess function. The proposed information retrieval model corresponds to the extension of the divergence from independence and is designed to be data-driven. The proposed model is then applied to the specific object search called the instance search and the effectiveness is experimentally confirmed.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics", "NTT Communicati ...
