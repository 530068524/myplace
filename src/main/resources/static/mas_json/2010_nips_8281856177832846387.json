Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) provides an efficient tool for generalizing the demonstration, based on the assumption that the expert is maximizing a utility function that is a linear combination of state-action features. Most IRL algorithms use a simple Monte Carlo estimation to approximate the expected feature counts under the expert's policy. In this paper, we show that the quality of the learned policies is highly sensitive to the error in estimating the feature counts. To reduce this error, we introduce a novel approach for bootstrapping the demonstration by assuming that: (i), the expert is (near-)optimal, and (ii), the dynamics of the system is known. Empirical results on gridworlds and car racing problems show that our approach is able to learn good policies from a small number of demonstrations.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Laval University", "Max Planck Society", "Laval University", "University of New South Wales", "Le Quy Don Technical University", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "Le Quy Don Technical University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Abdeslam Boularias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boularias:Abdeslam", "Brahim Chaib-draa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaib=draa:Brahim"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
