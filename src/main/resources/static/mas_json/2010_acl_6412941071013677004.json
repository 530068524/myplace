We argue that game theory is well suited for modeling discourse as a dynamic resulting from a number of conflicting pressures, and suggest applications of interest to computational linguists.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Beata Beigman Klebanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klebanov:Beata_Beigman", "Eyal Beigman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beigman:Eyal"], "pages": 12}
