In particular, for several of these models, the exact satisfiability threshold has been rigorously determined, confirming predictions from the statistical physics literature. Here we revisit one of these models, random regular NAE-SAT: knowing the satisfiability threshold, it is natural to study, in the satisfiable regime, the number of solutions in a typical instance. We prove here that these solutions have a well-defined free energy (limiting exponential growth rate), with explicit value matching the one-step replica symmetry breaking prediction. The proof develops new techniques for analyzing a certain \"survey propagation model\" associated to this problem. We believe that these methods may be applicable in a wide class of related problems.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Allan Sly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sly:Allan", "Nike Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Nike", "Yumeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yumeng"], "pages": 8}
