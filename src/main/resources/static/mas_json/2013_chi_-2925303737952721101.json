{"title": "Reflexive loopers for solo musical improvisation.", "fields": ["guitar", "musical improvisation", "jazz", "chord", "concatenative synthesis"], "abstract": "Loop pedals are real-time samplers that playback audio played previously by a musician. Such pedals are routinely used for music practice or outdoor \"busking\". However, loop pedals always playback the same material, which can make performances monotonous and boring both to the musician and the audience, preventing their widespread uptake in professional concerts. In response, we propose a new approach to loop pedals that addresses this issue, which is based on an analytical multi-modal representation of the audio input. Instead of simply playing back prerecorded audio, our system enables real-time generation of an  audio accompaniment  reacting to what is currently being performed by the musician. By combining different modes of performance - e.g. bass line, chords, solo - from the musician and system automatically, solo musicians can perform duets or trios with themselves, without engendering the so-called  canned (boringly repetitive and unresponsive) music  effect of loop pedals. We describe the technology, based on supervised classification and concatenative synthesis, and then illustrate our approach on solo performances of jazz standards by guitar. We claim this approach opens up new avenues for concert performance.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Goldsmiths, University of London", "Sony CSL Paris, Paris, France", "Sony CSL Paris, Paris, France", "Sony CSL Paris, Paris, France"], "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Pachet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pachet:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Pierre Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Pierre", "Julian Moreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moreira:Julian", "Mark d'Inverno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/d=Inverno:Mark"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
