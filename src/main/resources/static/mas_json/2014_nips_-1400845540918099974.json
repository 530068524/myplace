{"title": "Self-Paced Learning with Diversity.", "fields": ["semi supervised learning", "artificial intelligence", "regularization", "generalization error", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Self-paced learning (SPL) is a recently proposed learning regime inspired by the learning process of humans and animals that gradually incorporates easy to more complex samples into training. Existing methods are limited in that they ignore an important aspect in learning: diversity. To incorporate this information, we propose an approach called self-paced learning with diversity (SPLD) which formalizes the preference for both easy and diverse samples into a general regularizes This regularization term is independent of the learning objective, and thus can be easily generalized into various learning tasks. Albeit non-convex, the optimization of the variables included in this SPLD regularization term for sample selection can be globally solved in linearithmic time. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the conventional SPL on three real-world datasets. Specifically, SPLD achieves the best MAP so far reported in literature on the Hollywood2 and Olympic Sports datasets.", "citation": "Citations (139)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Lu Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0004:Lu", "Deyu Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Deyu", "Shoou-I Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Shoou=I", "Zhen-Zhong Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Zhen=Zhong", "Shiguang Shan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shan:Shiguang", "Alexander G.
