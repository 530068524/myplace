{"title": "Minimum-Latency Beaconing Schedule in Multihop Wireless Networks.", "fields": ["latency", "approximation algorithm", "communication complexity", "network topology", "schedule"], "abstract": "Minimum-latency beaconing schedule (MLBS) in synchronous multihop wireless networks seeks a schedule for beaconing with the shortest latency. This problem is NP-hard even when the interference radius is equal to the transmission radius. All prior works assume that the interference radius is equal to the transmission radius, and the best-known approxi- mation ratio for MLBS under this special interference model is 7. In this paper, we present a new approximation algorithm called strip coloring for MLBS under the general protocol interference model. Its approximation ratio is at most 5 when the interference radius is equal to transmission radius, and is between 3 and 6 in general.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City"], "authors": ["Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "XiaoHua Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:XiaoHua", "Lixin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lixin", "Xiaohua Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Xiaohua", "E.
