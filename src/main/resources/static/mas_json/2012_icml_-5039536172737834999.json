This setting is useful in applications where the explicit modeling of the environment is difficult, such as a dialogue system. We show that we can extract information about the environment model by inferring action selection process behind the demonstration, under the assumption that the expert is choosing optimal actions based on knowledge of the true model of the target environment. Proposed algorithms can achieve more accurate estimates of POMDP parameters and better policies from a short demonstration, compared to methods that learns only from the reaction from the environment.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Honda"], "authors": ["Takaki Makino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makino:Takaki", "Johane Takeuchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takeuchi:Johane"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
