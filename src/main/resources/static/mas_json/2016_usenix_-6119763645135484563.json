{"title": "StackMap: Low-Latency Networking with the OS Stack and Dedicated NICs.", "fields": ["network service", "network interface", "large receive offload", "internet protocol suite", "low latency"], "abstract": "StackMap leverages the best aspects of kernel-bypass networking into a new low-latency Linux network service based on the full-featured TCP kernel implementation, by dedicating network interfaces to applications and offering an extended version of the netmap API as a zero-copy, low-overhead data path while retaining the socket API for the control path. For small-message, transactional workloads, StackMap outperforms baseline Linux by 4 to 80% in latency and 4 to 391% in throughput. It also achieves comparable performance with Seastar, a highly-optimized user-level TCP/IP stack for DPDK.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Keio University", "NetApp", "NetApp", "NetApp"], "authors": ["Kenichi Yasukata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yasukata:Kenichi", "Michio Honda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Honda:Michio", "Douglas Santry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santry:Douglas", "Lars Eggert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eggert:Lars"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
