Efforts exist to mitigate limited L1 instruction cache capacity by relying on the stability and repetitiveness of the instruction stream to predict and prefetch future instruction blocks prior to their use. However, dynamic variation in cache miss sequences prevents correct and timely prediction, leaving many instruction-fetch stalls exposed, resulting in a key performance bottleneck for servers.   We observe that, while the vast majority of application instruction references are amenable to prediction, even minor control-flow variations are amplified by microarchitectural components, resulting in a major source of instability and randomness that significantly limit prefetcher utility. Control-flow variation disturbs the L1 instruction cache replacement order and branch predictor state, causing the L1 instruction cache to randomly filter the instruction stream while the branch predictor and spontaneous hardware interrupts inject the stream with unpredictable noise. Based on this observation, we show that an instruction prefetcher, previously plagued by microarchitectural instability, becomes nearly perfect when modified to operate on the correct-path, retire-order instruction stream. We propose Proactive Instruction Fetch, an instruction prefetch mechanism that achieves higher than 99.5% instruction-cache hit rate, improving server throughput by 27% and nearly matching the performance of a perfect L1 instruction cache that never misses.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Michael Ferdman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferdman:Michael", "Cansu Kaynak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaynak:Cansu", "Babak Falsafi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Falsafi:Babak"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2011", "pages": 11}
