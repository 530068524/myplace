{"title": "EPC RFID tag security weaknesses and defenses: passport cards, enhanced drivers licenses, and beyond.", "fields": ["systemic risk", "authentication", "double layer", "electronic product code", "license"], "abstract": "EPC (Electronic Product Code) tags are industry-standard RFID devices poised to supplant optical barcodes in many applications. We explore the systemic risks and challenges created by the increasingly common use of EPC for security applications. As a central case study, we examine the recently issued United States Passport Card and Washington State \"enhanced drivers license\" (WA EDL), both of which incorporate Gen-2 EPC tags. We measure multiple weaknesses, including susceptibility to cloning, extended read ranges, and the ability to remotely kill a WA EDL. We study the implications of these vulnerabilities to overall system security, and offer suggestions for improvement. We demonstrate anti-cloning techniques for off-the-shelf EPC tags, overcoming practical challenges in a previous proposal to co-opt the EPC \"kill\" command to achieve tag authentication. Our paper fills a vacuum of experimentally grounded evaluation of and guidance for security applications for EPC tags not just in identity documents, but more broadly in the authentication of objects and people.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "RSA Laboratorie ... bridge, MA, USA"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Karl Koscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koscher:Karl", "Ari Juels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juels:Ari", "Vjekoslav Brajkovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brajkovic:Vjekoslav", "Tadayoshi Kohno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohno:Tadayoshi"], "pages": 10}
