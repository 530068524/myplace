{"title": "Threshold and Revocation Cryptosystems via Extractable Hash Proofs.", "fields": ["random oracle", "threshold cryptosystem", "plaintext aware encryption", "56 bit encryption", "deterministic encryption"], "abstract": "We present a new unifying framework for constructing noninteractive threshold encryption and signature schemes, as well as broadcast encryption schemes, and in particular, derive several new cryptosystems based on hardness of factoring, including: - a threshold signature scheme (in the random oracle model) that supports ad-hoc groups (i.e., exponential number of identities and the set-up is independent of the total number of parties) and implements the standard Rabin signature; - a threshold encryption scheme that supports ad-hoc groups, where encryption is the same as that in the Blum-Goldwasser cryptosystem and therefore more efficient than RSA-based implementations; - a CCA-secure threshold encryption scheme in the random oracle model; - a broadcast encryption scheme (more precisely, a revocation cryptosystem) that supports ad-hoc groups, whose complexity is comparable to that of the Naor-Pinkas scheme; moreover, we provide a variant of the construction that is CCA-secure in the random oracle model.\n\nOur framework rests on a new notion of threshold extractable hash proofs. The latter can be viewed as a generalization of the extractable hash proofs, which are a special kind of non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Queens College"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Hoeteck Wee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wee:Hoeteck"], "pages": 21}
