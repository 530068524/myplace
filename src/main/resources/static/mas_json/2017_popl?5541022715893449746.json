The calculational design of the invariance proof method is by abstract interpretation of a truly parallel analytic semantics. This generalises the methods by Lamport and Owicki-Gries for sequential consistency. We use cat as an example of language to write consistency specifications of both concurrent programs and machine architectures.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University College London", "New York University"], "authors": ["Jade Alglave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alglave:Jade", "Patrick Cousot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cousot:Patrick"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 16}
