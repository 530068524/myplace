However, linearly approximating the dynamics in order to derive the new policy can bias the update and prevent convergence to the optimal policy. In this article, we propose a new model-free algorithm that backpropagates a local quadratic time-dependent Q-Function, allowing the derivation of the policy update in closed form. Our policy update ensures exact KL-constraint satisfaction without simplifying assumptions on the system dynamics demonstrating improved performance in comparison to related Trajectory Optimization algorithms linearizing the dynamics.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "University of Aveiro", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Riad Akrour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akrour:Riad", "Gerhard Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann:Gerhard", "Hany Abdulsamad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdulsamad:Hany", "Abbas Abdolmaleki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdolmaleki:Abbas"], "pages": 10}
