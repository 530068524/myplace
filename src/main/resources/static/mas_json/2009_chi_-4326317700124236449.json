The reform system envisions roles for both programmers and end users in enhancing existing websites to support new goals. First, a programmer authors a traditional mashup or browser extension, but they do not write a web scraper. Instead they use reform, which allows novice end users to attach the enhancement to their favorite sites with a scraping by-example interface. reform makes enhancements easier to program while also carrying the benefit that end users can apply the enhancements to any number of new websites. We present reform's architecture, user interface, interactive by-example extraction algorithm for novices, and evaluation, along with five example reform enabled enhancements.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft", "Adobe Systems", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Michael Toomim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toomim:Michael", "Steven M.
