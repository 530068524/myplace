For example, the set of theorems in many finitely axiomatisable theories is nonrecursive, but the set of theorems for any finitely axiomatisable complete theory is recursive. Finitely presented groups might have an nonrecursive word problem, but finitely presented simple groups have a recursive word problem.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["CARTE"], "authors": ["Emmanuel Jeandel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeandel:Emmanuel"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
