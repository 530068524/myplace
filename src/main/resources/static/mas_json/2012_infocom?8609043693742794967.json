To overcome the limited number of Chinese PlanetLab nodes and looking glass servers, we leverage several unique features in China's Internet, including the hierarchical structure of the major ISPs and the abundance of IDCs. Using only 15 vantage points, we design a traceroute scheme that finds significantly more interfaces and links than iPlane with significantly fewer traceroute probes. We then consider the problem of geolocating router interfaces and end hosts in China. We develop a heuristic for clustering the interface topology of a hierarchical ISP, and then apply the heuristic to the major Chinese ISPs. We show that the clustering heuristic can geolocate router interfaces with significantly more detail and accuracy than can the existing geoIP databases in isolation, and the resulting clusters expose the major ISPs' provincial structure. Finally, using the clustering heuristic, we propose a methodology for improving commercial geoIP databases.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "authors": ["Ye Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Ye", "Ratan Dey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dey:Ratan", "Yong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0013:Yong", "Keith W.
