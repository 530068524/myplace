{"title": "Understanding and Supporting Fathers and Fatherhood on Social Media Sites.", "fields": ["public relations", "social media", "social support", "the internet", "government"], "abstract": "Fathers are taking on more childcare and household responsibilities than they used to and many non-profit and government organizations have pushed for changes in policies to support fathers. Despite this effort, little research has explored how fathers go online related to their roles as fathers. Drawing on an interview study with 37 fathers, we find that they use social media to document and archive fatherhood, learn how to be a father, and access social support. They also go online to support diverse family needs, such as single fathers' use of Reddit instead of Facebook, fathers raised by single mothers' search for role models online, and stay-at-home fathers' use of father blogs. However, fathers are constrained by privacy concerns and perceptions of judgment relating to sharing content online about their children. Drawing on theories of fatherhood, we present theoretical and design ideas for designing online spaces to better support fathers and fatherhood. We conclude with a call for a research agenda to support fathers online.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tawfiq Ammari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ammari:Tawfiq", "Sarita Yardi Schoenebeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schoenebeck:Sarita_Yardi"], "pages": 10}
