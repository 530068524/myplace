Most previous IRL algorithms assume that the behaviour data is obtained from an agent who is optimizing a single reward function, but this assumption is hard to guarantee in practice. Our approach is based on integrating the Dirichlet process mixture model into Bayesian IRL. We provide an efficient Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm utilizing the gradient of the posterior to estimate the underlying reward functions, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous ones via experiments on a number of problem domains.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Jaedeug Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jaedeug", "Kee-Eung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kee=Eung"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
