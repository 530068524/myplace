A matrix based hierarchical prior is first proposed to represent the spectral structured sparsity and spatial unknown manifold structure of HSI simultaneously. Then, a latent variable Bayes model is introduced to learn the sparsity prior and estimate the noise jointly from measurements. The learned prior can fully represent the inherent 3D structure of HSI and regulate its shape based on the estimated noise level. Thus, with this learned prior, the proposed method improves the reconstruction accuracy significantly and shows strong robustness to unknown noise in HCS. Experiments on four real hyperspectral datasets show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on the reconstruction accuracy of HSI.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0054:Lei", "Wei Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei_0008:Wei", "Yanning Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanning", "Fei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0011:Fei", "Chunhua Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chunhua", "Qinfeng Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Qinfeng"], "pages": 9}
