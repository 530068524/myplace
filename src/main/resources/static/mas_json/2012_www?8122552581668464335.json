In this paper we introduce a declarative language to face these challenges. Based on navigational features, it is designed to specify fragments of the Web of Data and actions to be performed based on these data. We implement it in a centralized fashion, and show its power and performance. Finally, we explore the same ideas in a distributed setting, showing their feasibility, potentialities and challenges.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "University of Chile", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano"], "authors": ["Valeria Fionda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fionda:Valeria", "Claudio Guti\u00e9rrez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guti=eacute=rrez_0001:Claudio", "Giuseppe Pirr\u00f2.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pirr=ograve=:Giuseppe"], "conf": "www", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
