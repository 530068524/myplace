Although a few recent proposals have demonstrated the feasibility of this hybrid design, it still remains an open problem how to route DCN traffics with guaranteed performance under a hybrid DCN environment. In this paper, we make the first attempt to tackle this challenge, and propose the RUSH framework to minimize the network congestion in hybrid DCNs, by jointly routing flows and scheduling wireless (directional) antennas. Though the problem is shown to be NP-hard, the RUSH algorithms offer guaranteed performance bounds. Our algorithms are able to handle both batched arrivals and sequential arrivals of flow demands, and the theoretical analysis shows that they achieve competitive ratios of O(log n), where n is the number of switches in the network. We also conduct extensive simulations using ns-3 to verify the effectiveness of RUSH. The results demonstrate that RUSH produces nearly optimal performance and significantly outperforms the current practice and a simple greedy heuristics.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research"], "authors": ["Kai Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Kai", "Zhiming Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Zhiming", "Jun Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jun", "Liu Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Liu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
