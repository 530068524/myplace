{"title": "MP3: Minimizing performance penalty for power-gating of Clos network-on-chip.", "fields": ["power gating", "critical path method", "clos network", "latency", "router"], "abstract": "Power-gating is a promising technique to mitigate the increasing static power of on-chip routers. Clos networks are potentially good targets for power-gating because of their path diversity and decoupling between processing elements and most of the routers. While power-gated Clos networks can perform better than power-gated direct networks such as meshes, a significant performance penalty exists when conventional power-gating techniques are used. In this paper, we propose an effective power-gating scheme, called MP3 (Minimal Performance Penalty Power-gating), which is able to achieve minimal (i.e., near-zero) performance penalty and save more static energy than conventional power-gating applied to Clos networks. MP3 is able to completely remove the wakeup latency from the critical path, reduce long-term and transient contention, and actively steer network traffic to create increased power-gating opportunities. Full system evaluation using PARSEC benchmarks shows that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the performance penalty to less than 1% (as opposed to 38% with conventional power-gating) while saving more than 47% of router static energy, with only 2.5% additional area overhead.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Lizhong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lizhong", "Lihang Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Lihang", "Ruisheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ruisheng", "Timothy Mark Pinkston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinkston:Timothy_Mark"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
