{"title": "A Scalable Interdependent Multi-Issue Negotiation Protocol for Energy Exchange.", "fields": ["negotiation", "energy storage", "subgame perfect equilibrium", "scalability", "interdependence"], "abstract": "We present a novel negotiation protocol to facilitate energy exchange between off-grid homes that are equipped with renewable energy generation and electricity storage. Our protocol imposes restrictions over negotiation such that it reduces the complex interdependent multi-issue negotiation to one where agents have a strategy profile in subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. We show that our protocol is concurrent, scalable and; under certain conditions; leads to Pareto-optimal outcomes.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Muddasser Alam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alam:Muddasser", "Enrico H.
