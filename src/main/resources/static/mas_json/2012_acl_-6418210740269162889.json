{"title": "A Probabilistic Model for Canonicalizing Named Entity Mentions.", "fields": ["transduction", "named entity", "entity linking", "hierarchical clustering", "row"], "abstract": "We present a statistical model for canonicalizing named entity mentions into a table whose rows represent entities and whose columns are attributes (or parts of attributes). The model is novel in that it incorporates entity context, surface features, first-order dependencies among attribute-parts, and a notion of noise. Transductive learning from a few seeds and a collection of mention tokens combines Bayesian inference and conditional estimation. We evaluate our model and its components on two datasets collected from political blogs and sports news, finding that it outperforms a simple agglomerative clustering approach and previous work.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Dani Yogatama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yogatama:Dani", "Yanchuan Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Yanchuan", "Noah A.
