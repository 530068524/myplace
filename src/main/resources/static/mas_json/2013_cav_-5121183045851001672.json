{"title": "Learning Universally Quantified Invariants of Linear Data Structures.", "fields": ["equivalence", "regular language", "decidability", "subclass", "passive learning"], "abstract": "We propose a new automaton model, called quantified data automata over words, that can model quantified invariants over linear data structures, and build poly-time active learning algorithms for them, where the learner is allowed to query the teacher with membership and equivalence queries. In order to express invariants in decidable logics, we invent a decidable subclass of QDAs, called elastic QDAs, and prove that every QDA has a unique minimally-over-approximating elastic QDA. We then give an application of these theoretically sound and efficient active learning algorithms in a passive learning framework and show that we can efficiently learn quantified linear data structure invariants from samples obtained from dynamic runs for a large class of programs.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "RWTH Aachen University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Pranav Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg_0001:Pranav", "Christof L\u00f6ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=ouml=ding:Christof", "P.
