This paper examines how the practice of DIY (do-it-yourself) making has become a productive frame for a collective of fathers in the U.S. to express masculinity, amidst increasingly precarious economics and shifting norms of gender and labor in the home. Drawing from a qualitative interview study with fathers (n=22) and visual analysis of DIY father blogs (n=29), we examine how DIY fatherhood was produced across the material and discursive practices of blogging. This paper contributes an empirical account of a contemporary phenomenon: the construction and performance of DIY practice as a category of fatherhood identity and domestic masculinity. Further, the paper describes how fathers engage in entrepreneurial thinking as a form of domestic male labor.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Tawfiq Ammari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ammari:Tawfiq", "Sarita Schoenebeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schoenebeck:Sarita", "Silvia Lindtner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindtner:Silvia"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
