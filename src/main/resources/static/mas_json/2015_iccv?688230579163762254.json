For this reason, researchers have proposed optimising the L-\u221e norm of the L2 single view reprojection errors, which avoids the problem of local minima entirely. In this paper we present a novel method for L-\u221e triangulation that minimizes the L-\u221e norm of the L-\u221e reprojection errors: this apparently small difference leads to a much faster but equally accurate solution which is related to the MLE under the assumption of uniform noise. The proposed method adopts a new optimisation strategy based on solving simple quadratic equations. This stands in contrast with the fastest existing methods, which solve a sequence of more complex auxiliary Linear Programming or Second Order Cone Problems. The proposed algorithm performs well: for triangulation, it achieves the same accuracy as existing techniques while executing faster and being straightforward to implement.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Simon Donn\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donn=eacute=:Simon", "Bart Goossens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goossens:Bart", "Wilfried Philips.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Philips:Wilfried"], "pages": 9}
