Specifically we consider seven notions of privacy for deterministic encryption, including six forms of semantic security and an indistinguishability notion, and show them all equivalent. We then present a deterministic scheme for the secure encryption of uniformly and independently distributed messages based solely on the existence of trapdoor one-way permutations. We show a generalization of the construction that allows secure deterministic encryption of independent high-entropy messages. Finally we show relations between deterministic and standard (randomized) encryption.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Marc Fischlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischlin:Marc", "Adam O'Neill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Neill:Adam", "Thomas Ristenpart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ristenpart:Thomas"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 19}
