Secret handshakes enable mutual authentication, with the property that the parties learn nothing about each other unless they have been both issued credentials by a group administrator. This property provides strong privacy guarantees that enable interesting applications. One of them is proximity-based discovery for private communities. We introduce MASHaBLE, a mobile application that enables participants to discover and interact with nearby users if and only if they belong to the same secret community. We use direct peer-to-peer communication over Bluetooth LE, rather than relying on a central server. We discuss the specifics of implementing secret handshakes over Bluetooth LE and present our prototype implementation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yan Michalevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michalevsky:Yan", "Suman Nath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nath:Suman", "Jie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jie"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
