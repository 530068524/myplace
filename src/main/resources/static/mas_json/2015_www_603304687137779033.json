{"title": "Towards Reconciling SPARQL and Certain Answers.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "web ontology language", "rdf schema", "named graph", "sparql"], "abstract": "SPARQL entailment regimes are strongly influenced by the big body of works on ontology-based query answering, notably in the area of Description Logics (DLs). However, the semantics of query answering under SPARQL entailment regimes is defined in a more naive and much less expressive way than the certain answer semantics usually adopted in DLs. The goal of this work is to introduce an intuitive certain answer semantics also for SPARQL and to show the feasibility of this approach. For OWL 2 QL entailment, we present algorithms for the evaluation of an interesting fragment of SPARQL (the so-called well-designed SPARQL). Moreover, we show that the complexity of the most fundamental query analysis tasks (such as query containment and equivalence testing) is not negatively affected by the presence of OWL 2 QL entailment under the proposed semantics.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Shqiponja Ahmetaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmetaj:Shqiponja", "Wolfgang Fischl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischl:Wolfgang", "Reinhard Pichler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pichler:Reinhard", "Mantas Simkus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simkus:Mantas", "Sebastian Skritek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skritek:Sebastian"], "conf": "www", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
