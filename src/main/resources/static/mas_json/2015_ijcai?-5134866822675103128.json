It was recently shown that the ideas of L* can be extended to yield non-deterministic automata, and that the respective learning algorithm, NL*, outperforms L* on randomly generated regular expressions.\n\nWe conjectured that this is due to the existential nature of regular expressions, and NL* might not outperform L* on languages with a universal nature. In this paper we introduce UL* -- a learning algorithm for universal automata (the dual of non-deterministic automata); and AL* -- a learning algorithm for alternating automata (which generalize both universal and non-deterministic automata). Our empirical results illustrate the advantages and trade-offs among L*, NL*, UL* and AL*.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Yale University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Dana Angluin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angluin:Dana", "Sarah Eisenstat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisenstat:Sarah", "Dana Fisman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fisman:Dana"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
