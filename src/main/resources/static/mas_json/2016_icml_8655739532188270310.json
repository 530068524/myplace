However, in recent years generic and powerful recurrent neural network architectures have been developed to learn discriminative text feature representations. Meanwhile, deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) have begun to generate highly compelling images of specific categories, such as faces, album covers, and room interiors. In this work, we develop a novel deep architecture and GAN formulation to effectively bridge these advances in text and image modeling, translating visual concepts from characters to pixels. We demonstrate the capability of our model to generate plausible images of birds and flowers from detailed text descriptions.", "citation": "Citations (549)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Max Planck Society", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Scott E.
