Such spaces are highly dynamic and typically undergo continuous change. Software engineering can have a profound impact in this domain, by defining suitable modeling and specification notations as well as supporting design-time formal verification. In this paper, we present a methodology and a technical framework which support modeling of evolving cyber-physical spaces and reasoning about their spatio-temporal properties. We utilize a discrete, graph-based formalism for modeling cyber-physical spaces as well as primitives of change, giving rise to a reactive system consisting of rewriting rules with both local and global application conditions. Formal reasoning facilities are implemented adopting logic-based specification of properties and according model checking procedures, in both spatial and temporal fragments. We evaluate our approach using a case study of a disaster scenario in a smart city.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Christos Tsigkanos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsigkanos:Christos", "Timo Kehrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kehrer:Timo", "Carlo Ghezzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghezzi:Carlo"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
