We give a new randomized coloring algorithm for (\u2206+1)-coloring running in O(\u221alog \u2206)+ 2^O(\u221alog log n) rounds with probability 1-1/n^\u03a9(1) in a graph with n nodes and maximum degree \u2206. This implies that the (\u2206+1)-coloring problem is easier than the maximal independent set problem and the maximal matching problem, due to their lower bounds by Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer [PODC'04]. Our algorithm also extends to the list-coloring problem where the palette of each node contains \u2206+1 colors.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "ABB Corporate Research, USA"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["David G.
