Specifically, we design a novel hybrid camera system to obtain two complementary measurements that sample the angular and spectral dimensions respectively. To recover the full 5D hyperspectral light field from the severely undersampled measurements, we then propose an efficient computational reconstruction algorithm by exploiting the large correlations across the angular and spectral dimensions through self-learned dictionaries. Simulation on an elaborate hyperspectral light field dataset validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Hardware experimental results demonstrate that, for the first time to our knowledge, a 5D hyperspectral light field containing 9x9 angular views and 27 spectral bands can be acquired in a single shot.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Xidian University", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhiwei Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Zhiwei", "Lizhi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lizhi", "Huiqun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Huiqun", "Dong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Dong", "Feng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Feng"], "pages": 9}
