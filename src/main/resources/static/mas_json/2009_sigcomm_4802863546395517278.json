This paper presents ROMA, a practical, distributed channel assignment and routing protocol that achieves good multi-hop path performance between every node and one or more designated gateway nodes in a dual-radio network. ROMA assigns non-overlapping channels to links along each gateway path to eliminate intra-path interference. ROMA reduces inter-path interference by assigning different channels to paths destined for different gateways whenever possible. Evaluations on a 24-node dual-radio testbed show that ROMA achieves high throughput in a variety of scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (172)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["New York University", "Tsinghua University", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Aditya Dhananjay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhananjay:Aditya", "Hui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0013:Hui", "Jinyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Jinyang", "Lakshminarayanan Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Lakshminarayanan"], "pages": 12}
