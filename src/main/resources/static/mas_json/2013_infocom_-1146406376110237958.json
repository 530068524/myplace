Smart (directional) antennas can enhance the functionalities of RSs by forming the beam only towards intended receiving Subscriber Stations (SSs). In this paper, we study a joint problem of selecting a beam width and direction for the smart antenna at each RS and determining the RS assignment for SSs in each scheduling period. The objective is to maximize a utility function that can lead to a stable and high-throughput system. We define this as the Beam Scheduling and Relay Assignment Problem (BS-RAP). We show that BS-RAP is NP-hard, present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to provide optimal solutions and present two polynomial-time greedy algorithms, one of which is shown to have a constant factor approximation ratio.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Montana State University", "Syracuse University", "Montana State University", "Montana State University"], "authors": ["Brendan Mumey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mumey:Brendan", "Jian Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0008:Jian", "Ivan R.
