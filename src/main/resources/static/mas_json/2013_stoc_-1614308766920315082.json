{"title": "Going after the k-SAT threshold.", "fields": ["graph coloring", "belief propagation", "cavity method", "constraint satisfaction problem", "second moment method"], "abstract": "Random  k -SAT is the single most intensely studied example of a random constraint satisfaction problem. But despite substantial progress over the past decade, the threshold for the existence of satisfying assignments is not known precisely for any k\u22653. The best current results, based on the second moment method, yield upper and lower bounds that differ by an additive k \u22c5 {ln2}/2, a term that is unbounded in k (Achlioptas, Peres: STOC 2003). The basic reason for this gap is the inherent asymmetry of the Boolean values 'true' and 'false' in contrast to the perfect symmetry, e.g., among the various colors in a graph coloring problem. Here we develop a new  asymmetric second moment method  that allows us to tackle this issue head on for the first time in the theory of random CSPs. This technique enables us to compute the k-SAT threshold up to an additive ln2-1/2+O(1/k) ~0.19. Independently of the rigorous work, physicists have developed a sophisticated but non-rigorous technique called the \"cavity method\" for the study of random CSPs (Mezard, Parisi, Zecchina: Science~2002). Our result matches the best bound that can be obtained from the so-called \"replica symmetric\" version of the cavity method, and indeed our proof directly harnesses parts of the physics calculations.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Goethe University Frankfurt", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Amin Coja-Oghlan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coja=Oghlan:Amin", "Konstantinos Panagiotou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panagiotou:Konstantinos"], "pages": 10}
