Co-3Deator includes two specific team-first features: a  concept component hierarchy  which provides a design representation suitable for multi-level sharing and reusing of design information, and a  collaborative design explorer  for storing, viewing, and accessing hierarchical design data during collaborative design activities. We conduct two controlled user studies, one with individual designers to elicit the form and functionality of the collaborative design explorer, and the other with design teams to evaluate the utility of the concept component hierarchy and design explorer towards collaborative design ideation. Our results support our rationale for both of the proposed team-first collaboration mechanisms and suggest further ways to streamline collaborative design.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Purdue University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Cecil Piya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piya:Cecil", "Vinayak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vinayak:", "Senthil K.
