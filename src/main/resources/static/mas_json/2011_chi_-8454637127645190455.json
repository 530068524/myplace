Pixel-based methods offer unique potential for addressing these challenges independent of the implementation of any particular interface or toolkit. This work builds upon Prefab, which enables the modification of existing interfaces. We present new methods for hierarchical models of complex widgets, real-time interpretation of interface content, and real-time interpretation of content and hierarchy throughout an entire interface. We validate our new methods through implementations of four applications: stencil-based tutorials, ephemeral adaptation, interface translation, and end-user interface customization. We demonstrate these enhancements in complex existing applications created from different user interface toolkits running on different operating systems.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Morgan Dixon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dixon:Morgan", "Daniel Leventhal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leventhal:Daniel", "James Fogarty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fogarty:James"], "pages": 10}
