In a nutshell, we propose to learn a model of societal preferences, and, when faced with a specific ethical dilemma at runtime, efficiently aggregate those preferences to identify a desirable choice. We provide a concrete algorithm that instantiates our approach; some of its crucial steps are informed by a new theory of swap-dominance efficient voting rules. Finally, we implement and evaluate a system for ethical decision making in the autonomous vehicle domain, using preference data collected from 1.3 million people through the Moral Machine website.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Masdar Institute of Science and Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ritesh Noothigattu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noothigattu:Ritesh", "Snehalkumar (Neil) S.
