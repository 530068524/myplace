In this study we explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation. Drawing on a sample survey of undergraduate Facebook users, we examine a particular privacy-enhancing practice: having a friends-only Facebook profile. Particularly, we look at the association between network composition, expectancy violations, interpersonal privacy practices and having a friends-only profile. We find that expectancy violations by weak ties and increased levels of interpersonal privacy management are positively associated with having a friends-only profile. We conclude with a discussion of how these findings may be integrated into the design of systems to facilitate interaction while enhancing individual privacy.", "citation": "Citations (281)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Frederic Stutzman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stutzman:Frederic", "Jacob Kramer-Duffield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kramer=Duffield:Jacob"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
