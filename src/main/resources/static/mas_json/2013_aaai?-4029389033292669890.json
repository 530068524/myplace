Our algorithm significantly improves state-of-the-art results and justifies the significance of the lattice models. In addition to these, our analysis reveals the weakness of several energy functions used.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Griffith University", "Griffith University", "Griffith University"], "authors": ["Swakkhar Shatabda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shatabda:Swakkhar", "M.
