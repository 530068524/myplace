{"title": "Mind the gap: assessing the conformance of software traceability to relevant guidelines.", "fields": ["reverse semantic traceability", "guideline", "traceability matrix", "requirements traceability", "software system"], "abstract": "Many guidelines for safety-critical industries such as aeronautics, medical devices, and railway communications, specify that traceability must be used to demonstrate that a rigorous process has been followed and to provide evidence that the system is safe for use. In practice, there is a gap between what is prescribed by guidelines and what is implemented in practice, making it difficult for organizations and certifiers to fully evaluate the safety of the software system. In this paper we present an approach, which parses a guideline to extract a Traceability Model depicting software artifact types and their prescribed traces. It then analyzes the traceability data within a project to identify areas of traceability failure. Missing traceability paths, redundant and/or inconsistent data, and other problems are highlighted. We used our approach to evaluate the traceability of seven safety-critical software systems and found that none of the evaluated projects contained traceability that fully conformed to its relevant guidelines.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau", "DePaul University"], "authors": ["Patrick Rempel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rempel:Patrick", "Patrick M\u00e4der.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=auml=der:Patrick", "Tobias Kuschke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuschke:Tobias", "Jane Cleland-Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cleland=Huang:Jane"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
