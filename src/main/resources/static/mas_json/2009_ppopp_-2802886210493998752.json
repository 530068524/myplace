{"title": "Application-aware management of parallel simulation collections.", "fields": ["high throughput computing", "workload", "parallel algorithm", "resource allocation", "job scheduler"], "abstract": "This paper presents a system deployed on parallel clusters to manage a collection of parallel simulations that make up a computational study. It explores how such a system can extend traditional parallel job scheduling and resource allocation techniques to incorporate knowledge specific to the study.   Using a UINTAH-based helium gas simulation code (ARCHES) and the SimX system for multi-experiment computational studies, this paper demonstrates that, by using application-specific knowledge in resource allocation and scheduling decisions, one can reduce the run time of a computational study from over 20 hours to under 4.5 hours on a 32-processor cluster, and from almost 11 hours to just over 3.5 hours on a 64-processor cluster.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Siu Yau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yau:Siu", "Vijay Karamcheti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karamcheti:Vijay", "Denis Zorin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zorin:Denis", "Kostadin Damevski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damevski:Kostadin", "Steven G.
