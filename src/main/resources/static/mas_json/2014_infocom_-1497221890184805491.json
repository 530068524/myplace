Here, agents model their opponents through a distribution over their action spaces and play the best response. The system is at an MFE if this action is itself a sample drawn from the assumed distribution. In our setting, the agents are smart phone apps that generate service requests, experience waiting costs, and bid for service from base stations. We show that if we conduct a second-price auction at each base station, there exists an MFE that would schedule the app with the longest queue at each time. The result suggests that auctions can attain the same desirable results as queue-length-based scheduling. We present results on the asymptotic convergence of a system with a finite number of agents to the mean field case, and conclude with simulation results illustrating the simplicity of computation of the MFE.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Mayank Manjrekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manjrekar:Mayank", "Vinod Ramaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramaswamy:Vinod", "Srinivas Shakkottai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shakkottai:Srinivas"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
