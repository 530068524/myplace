In this paper, we address the problem of mapping a homogeneous synchronous dataflow (HSDF) graph onto a multiprocessor platform with the objective of maximizing system throughput. We present two optimization approaches based on branch-and-bound and SAT-solving to explore the design space of all possible actor-to-processor mappings and static order schedules on each processor. In the logic-based benders decomposition (LBBD) approach, we decompose the problem into a master problem of finding a feasible actor mapping and scheduling, and a sub-problem of deadlock-checking and throughput computation. In the integrated approach, we integrate branch-and-bound search into the SAT engine to achieve more effective search tree pruning and better scalability. Performance evaluation shows that the integrated approach outperforms the LBBD approach by a large margin.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "McGill University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Weichen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Weichen", "Mingxuan Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Mingxuan", "Xiuqiang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiuqiang", "Zonghua Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Zonghua", "Xue Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Xue"], "pages": 13}
