Many iterative methods have been proposed to tackle such an optimization problem. However, it remains an open problem to have a method that is not only practically fast but also is globally convergent. In this paper, we proposed a fast proximal method for solving '0 norm based dictionary learning problems, and we proved that the whole sequence generated by the proposed method converges to a stationary point with sub-linear convergence rate. The benefit of having a fast and convergent dictionary learning method is demonstrated in the applications of image recovery and face recognition.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chenglong Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Chenglong", "Hui Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Hui", "Yuhui Quan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quan:Yuhui", "Zuowei Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Zuowei"], "pages": 8}
