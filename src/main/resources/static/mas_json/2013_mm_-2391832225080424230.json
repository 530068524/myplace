A robust tagging method must have the capability to meet the two challenging requirements: limited labeled training samples and noisy labeled training samples. In this paper, we investigate this challenging problem of learning with limited and noisy tagging and propose a discriminative model, called SpSVM-MC, that exploits both labeled and unlabeled data through a semi-parametric regularization and takes advantage of the multi-label constraints into the optimization. While SpSVM-MC is a general method for learning with limited and noisy tagging, in the evaluations we focus on the specific application of noisy image tagging with limited labeled training samples on a benchmark dataset. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations in comparison with state-of-the-art literature demonstrate that SpSVM-MC outstands with a superior performance.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Yingming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingming", "Zhongang Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Zhongang", "Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongfei_=Mark=", "Ming Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ming"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
