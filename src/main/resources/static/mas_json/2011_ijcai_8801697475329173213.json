{"title": "Consequence-Based Reasoning beyond Horn Ontologies.", "fields": ["ontology", "axiom", "ontology language", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Consequence-based ontology reasoning procedures have so far been known only for Horn ontology languages. A difficulty in extending such procedures is that non-Horn axioms seem to require reasoning by case, which causes non-determinism in tableau-based procedures. In this paper we present a consequence-based procedure for ALCH that overcomes this difficulty by using rules similar to ordered resolution to deal with disjunctive axioms in a deterministic way; it retains all the favourable attributes of existing consequence-based procedures, such as goal-directed \"one pass\" classification, optimal worst-case complexity, and \"pay-as-you-go\" behaviour. Our preliminary empirical evaluation suggests that the procedure scales well to non-Horn ontologies.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Frantisek Simancik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simancik:Frantisek", "Yevgeny Kazakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazakov:Yevgeny", "Ian Horrocks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horrocks:Ian"], "pages": 6}
