The key idea is to span a subset of implicit functions with linear combinations of spatially-localized kernels that follow image features. This is achieved by replacing the Euclidean distance in conventional Radial Basis Functions with non-Euclidean, image-dependent distances. For the minimization of an objective region-based criterion, this representation yields more accurate results with fewer control points than its Euclidean counterpart. If the user positions these control points, the non-Euclidean distance enables to further specify our localized kernels for a target object in the image. Moreover, an intuitive control of the result of the segmentation is obtained by casting inside/outside labels as linear inequality constraints. Finally, we discuss several algorithmic aspects needed for a responsive interactive workflow. We have applied this framework to 3D medical imaging and built a real-time prototype with which the segmentation of whole organs is only a few clicks away.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Philips", "Philips", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Benoit Mory.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mory:Benoit", "Roberto Ardon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ardon:Roberto", "Anthony J.
