{"title": "On the Indifferentiability of the Sponge Construction.", "fields": ["random oracle", "random function", "pseudorandom permutation", "block cipher", "random permutation"], "abstract": "In this paper we prove that the sponge construction introduced in [4] is indifferentiable from a random oracle when being used with a random transformation or a random permutation and discuss its implications. To our knowledge, this is the first time indifferentiability has been shown for a construction calling a random permutation (instead of an ideal compression function or ideal block cipher) and for a construction generating outputs of any length (instead of a fixed length).", "citation": "Citations (324)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["STMicroelectronics", "STMicroelectronics", "NXP Semiconductors", "STMicroelectronics"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Guido Bertoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertoni:Guido", "Joan Daemen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daemen:Joan", "Micha\u00ebl Peeters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peeters:Micha=euml=l", "Gilles Van Assche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Assche:Gilles_Van"], "pages": 17}
