The function f is assumed to be locally smooth (around one of its global maxima) with respect to a semi-metric l We describe two algorithms based on optimistic exploration that use a hierarchical partitioning of the space at all scales. A first contribution is an algorithm, DOO, that requires the knowledge of l. We report a finite-sample performance bound in terms of a measure of the quantity of near-optimal states. We then define a second algorithm, SOO, which does not require the knowledge of the semi-metric l under which f is smooth, and whose performance is almost as good as DOO optimally-fitted.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
