Assuming that the sender is providing the same data to multiple receivers over independent packet erasure channels, we focus on the case of perfect feedback and heterogeneous erasure probabilities. Based on a general analytical framework for evaluating the decoding delay, we show that existing ARQ schemes fail to ensure that receivers with weak channels are able to recover from packet losses within reasonable time. To overcome this problem, we re-define the encoding rules in order to break the chains of linear combinations that cannot be decoded after one of the packets is lost. Our results show that sending uncoded packets at key times ensures that all the receivers are able to meet specific delay requirements with very high probability.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "departments": ["University of Padua", "IMDEA", "Inst. de Teleco ... do Porto, Porto", "Inst. de Teleco ... do Porto, Porto"], "authors": ["Jo\u00e3o Barros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barros:Jo=atilde=o", "Rui A.
