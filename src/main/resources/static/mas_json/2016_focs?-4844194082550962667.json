We present a new construction of an extractor which works for algebraic sets defined by polynomials over GF(2) of substantially higher degree than the current state-of-the-art construction. We also exactly determine the GF(2)-polynomial degree of the recursive Fourier sampling problem and use this to provide new partial results towards a circuit lower bound for this problem. Finally, we answer a question concerning VC dimension, interpolation degree and the Hilbert function.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": [], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Zachary Remscrim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Remscrim:Zachary"], "pages": 12}
