{"title": "Modeling Temporal Dependencies in High-Dimensional Sequences: Application to Polyphonic Music Generation and Transcription.", "fields": ["musical language", "machine learning", "statistical model", "recurrent neural network", "polyphony"], "abstract": "We investigate the problem of modeling symbolic sequences of polyphonic music in a completely general piano-roll representation. We introduce a probabilistic model based on distribution estimators conditioned on a recurrent neural network that is able to discover temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences. Our approach outperforms many traditional models of polyphonic music on a variety of realistic datasets. We show how our musical language model can serve as a symbolic prior to improve the accuracy of polyphonic transcription.", "citation": "Citations (385)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boulanger=Lewandowski:Nicolas", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua", "Pascal Vincent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vincent:Pascal"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
