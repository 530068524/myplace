{"title": "Beyond frontal faces: Improving Person Recognition using multiple cues.", "fields": ["computer vision", "image resolution", "pattern recognition", "deepface", "three dimensional face recognition"], "abstract": "We explore the task of recognizing peoples' identities in photo albums in an unconstrained setting. To facilitate this, we introduce the new People In Photo Albums (PIPA) dataset, consisting of over 60000 instances of \u223c2000 individuals collected from public Flickr photo albums. With only about half of the person images containing a frontal face, the recognition task is very challenging due to the large variations in pose, clothing, camera viewpoint, image resolution and illumination. We propose the Pose Invariant PErson Recognition (PIPER) method, which accumulates the cues of poselet-level person recognizers trained by deep convolutional networks to discount for the pose variations, combined with a face recognizer and a global recognizer. Experiments on three different settings confirm that in our unconstrained setup PIPER significantly improves on the performance of DeepFace, which is one of the best face recognizers as measured on the LFW dataset.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ning Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0014:Ning", "Manohar Paluri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paluri:Manohar", "Yaniv Taigman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taigman:Yaniv", "Rob Fergus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fergus:Rob", "Lubomir D.
