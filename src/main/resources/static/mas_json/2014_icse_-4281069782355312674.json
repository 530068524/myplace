To this end, two parallel lines of research have emerged over the last years. Static analysis seeks to find defects using algorithms that process well-defined semantic abstractions of code. Statistical defect prediction uses historical data to estimate parameters of statistical formulae modeling the phenomena thought to govern defect occurrence and predict where defects are likely to occur. These two approaches have emerged from distinct intellectual traditions and have largely evolved independently, in \u201csplendid isolation\u201d. In this paper, we evaluate these two (largely) disparate approaches on a similar footing. We use historical defect data to apprise the two approaches, compare them, and seek synergies. We find that under some accounting principles, they provide comparable benefits; we also find that in some settings, the performance of certain static bug-finders can be enhanced using information provided by statistical defect prediction.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University College London", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Foyzur Rahman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahman:Foyzur", "Sameer Khatri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khatri:Sameer", "Earl T.
