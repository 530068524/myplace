We propose an alternative approach based on abstraction refinement. Our new method computes the assumptions for the assume-guarantee rules as conservative and not necessarily deterministic abstractions of some of the components, and refines those abstractions using counterexamples obtained from model checking them together with the other components. Our approach also exploits the alphabets of the interfaces between components and performs iterative refinement of those alphabets as well as of the abstractions. We show experimentally that our preliminary implementation of the proposed alternative achieves similar or better performance than a previous learning-based implementation.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Mihaela Gheorghiu Bobaru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bobaru:Mihaela_Gheorghiu", "Corina S.
