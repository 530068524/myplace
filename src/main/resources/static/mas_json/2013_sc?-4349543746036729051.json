{"title": "Toward millions of file system IOPS on low-cost, commodity hardware.", "fields": ["cache invalidation", "page cache", "smart cache", "memory mapped file", "cache pollution"], "abstract": "We describe a storage system that removes I/O bottlenecks to achieve more than one million IOPS based on a userspace file abstraction for arrays of commodity SSDs. The file abstraction refactors I/O scheduling and placement for extreme parallelism and non-uniform memory and I/O. The system includes a set-associative, parallel page cache in the user space. We redesign page caching to eliminate CPU overhead and lock-contention in non-uniform memory architecture machines. We evaluate our design on a 32 core NUMA machine with four, eight-core processors. Experiments show that our design delivers 1.23 million 512-byte read IOPS. The page cache realizes the scalable IOPS of Linux asynchronous I/O (AIO) and increases user-perceived I/O performance linearly with cache hit rates. The parallel, set-associative cache matches the cache hit rates of the global Linux page cache under real workloads.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "authors": ["Da Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Da", "Randal C.
