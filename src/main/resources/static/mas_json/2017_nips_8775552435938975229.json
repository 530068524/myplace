Unfortunately, these techniques are unable to deal with stochastic perturbations of input data, induced for example by data augmentation. In such cases, the objective is no longer a finite sum, and the main candidate for optimization is the stochastic gradient descent method (SGD). In this paper, we introduce a variance reduction approach for these settings when the objective is composite and strongly convex. The convergence rate outperforms SGD with a typically much smaller constant factor, which depends on the variance of gradient estimates only due to perturbations on a single example.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Thoth"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alberto Bietti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bietti:Alberto", "Julien Mairal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mairal:Julien"], "pages": 11}
