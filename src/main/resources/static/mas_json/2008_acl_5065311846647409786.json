Central to our approach is vector composition which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models which we evaluate empirically on a sentence similarity task. Experimental results demonstrate that the multiplicative models are superior to the additive alternatives when compared against human judgments.", "citation": "Citations (559)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jeff Mitchell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitchell:Jeff", "Mirella Lapata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lapata:Mirella"], "pages": 9}
