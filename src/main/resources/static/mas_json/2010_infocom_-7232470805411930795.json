{"title": "Multipath Wireless Network Coding: A Population Game Perspective.", "fields": ["throughput", "controller", "linear network coding", "multipath propagation", "spread spectrum"], "abstract": "We consider wireless networks in which multiple paths are available between each source and destination. We allow each source to split traffic among all of its available paths, and ask the question: how do we attain the lowest possible number of transmissions per unit time to support a given traffic matrix? Traffic bound in opposite directions over two wireless hops can utilize the ``reverse carpooling'' advantage of network coding in order to decrease the number of transmissions used. We call such coded hops as ``hyper-links''. With the reverse carpooling technique longer paths might be cheaper than shorter ones. However, there is a prisoners dilemma type situation among sources -- the network coding advantage is realized only if there is traffic in both directions of a shared path. We develop a two-level distributed control scheme that decouples user choices from each other by declaring a hyper- link capacity, allowing sources to split their traffic selfishly in a distributed fashion, and then changing the hyper-link capacity based on user actions. We show that such a controller is stable, and verify our analytical insights by simulation.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Vinith Reddy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reddy:Vinith", "Srinivas Shakkottai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shakkottai:Srinivas", "Alexander Sprintson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sprintson:Alexander", "Natarajan Gautam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gautam:Natarajan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
