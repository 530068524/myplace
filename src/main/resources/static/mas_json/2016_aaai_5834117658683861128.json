{"title": "Evaluation of Semantic Dependency Labeling Across Domains.", "fields": ["semantic web stack", "semantic grid", "semantic computing", "semantic compression", "semantic search"], "abstract": "One of the key concerns in computational semantics is to construct a domain independent semantic representation which captures the richness of natural language, yet can be quickly customized to a specific domain for practical applications. We propose to use generic semantic frames defined in FrameNet, a domain-independent semantic resource, as an intermediate semantic representation for language understanding in dialog systems. In this paper we: (a) outline a novel method for FrameNet-style semantic dependency labeling that builds on a syntactic dependency parse; and (b) compare the accuracy of domain-adapted and generic approaches to semantic parsing for dialog tasks, using a frame-annotated corpus of human-computer dialogs in an airline reservation domain.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Interactions La ... , New York, NY", "Interactions La ... urray Hill, NJ"], "authors": ["Svetlana Stoyanchev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoyanchev:Svetlana", "Amanda Stent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stent:Amanda", "Srinivas Bangalore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bangalore:Srinivas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
