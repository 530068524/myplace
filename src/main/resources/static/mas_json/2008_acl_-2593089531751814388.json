Current research in both of these areas is actively pursuing its incorporation. However, STAG parsing is known to be NP-hard due to the potential for intertwined correspondences between the linked nonterminal symbols in the elementary structures. Given a particular grammar, the polynomial degree of efficient STAG parsing algorithms depends directly on the rank of the grammar: the maximum number of correspondences that appear within a single elementary structure. In this paper we present a compile-time algorithm for transforming a STAG into a strongly-equivalent STAG that optimally minimizes the rank, k, across the grammar. The algorithm performs inO(|G| +|Y|\u00b7L 3 ) time where LG is the maximum number of links in any single synchronous tree pair in the grammar and Y is the set of synchronous tree pairs ofG.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Harvard University", "University of Padua", "Harvard University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Rebecca Nesson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nesson:Rebecca", "Giorgio Satta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satta:Giorgio", "Stuart M.
