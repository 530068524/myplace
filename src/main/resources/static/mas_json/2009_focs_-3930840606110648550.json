We introduce the notion of {\\em correlation extractors}, which extract nearly perfect independent instances of a given joint distribution from imperfect, or \"leaky,'' instances of the same distribution. More concretely, suppose that Alice holds $a$ and Bob holds $b$, where $(a, b)$ are obtained by taking $n$ independent samples from a joint distribution $(X, Y)$ and letting $a$ include all $X$ instances and $b$ include all $Y$ instances. An adversary Eve obtains partial information about $(a, b)$ by choosing a function $L$ with output length $t$ and learning $L(a, b)$.The goal is to design a protocol between Alice and Bob which may use additional fresh randomness, such that for every $L$ as above the following holds. In the end of the interaction, Alice outputs $a'$ and Bob outputs $b'$ such that $(a', b')$ are statistically indistinguishable from $m$ independent instances of $(X, Y)$ even when conditioned on Eve's view, and {\\em even when conditioned on the joint view of Eve together with either Alice or Bob}.The standard questions of privacy amplification and randomness extraction correspond to the case where $X$ and $Y$ are identical random bits. In this work we address this question for other types of correlations. A central special case is that of {\\em OT extractors}, which are correlation extractors for the correlation $(X, Y)$ corresponding to the cryptographic primitive of oblivious transfer. Our main result is that for any finite joint distribution $(X, Y)$ there is an explicit correlation extractor which extracts $m=\\Omega(n)$ instances using $O(n)$ bits of communication, even when $t=\\Omega(n)$ bits of information can be leaked to Eve. We present several applications which motivate the concept of correlation extractors and our main result. These include:\\begin{itemize} \\item Protecting certain cryptographic protocols against side-channel attacks. \\item A protocol which realizes $m$ instances of oblivious transfer by communicating only $O(m)$ bits. The security of the protocol relies on a number-theoretic intractability assumption. \\item A {\\em constant-rate} unconditionally secure construction of oblivious transfer (for semi-honest parties) from {\\em any nontrivial channel}. This establishes constant-rate equivalence of any two nontrivial finite channels.\\end{itemize}", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Yuval Ishai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishai:Yuval", "Eyal Kushilevitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kushilevitz:Eyal", "Rafail Ostrovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrovsky:Rafail", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
