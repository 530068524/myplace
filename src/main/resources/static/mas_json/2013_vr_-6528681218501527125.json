However, a key aim of these simulations may be to study how users of different body sizes and proportions interact with the environment. We have developed a real time motion retargeting method by which users can be immersed into different humanoids and other kinematically similar avatars, and still experience a realistic feeling of immersion. A set of experiments aimed at studying the realism of the immersion indicate that users indeed experience a realistic sense of immersion into different humanoids.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Wichita State University", "Wichita State University"], "authors": ["Weiwei Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Weiwei", "Vis.
