{"title": "Hedonic design for winter UbiMount: illuminated snowboard in-the-wild.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "embedded system", "computer science", "gesture", "simulation"], "abstract": "We present a functional prototype of an interactive illuminated snowboard, which was trialed in-the-wild. We discuss the challenges in prototyping and evaluating ubiquitous computing demos in-the-wild in the winter mountain context. Equipment related issues such as reduced battery capacity, and camera functionality at low temperatures are identified as particular problems. Prototype design should enable operation whilst wearing gloves, for example switching test modes, via motion gestures. The necessity to open prototype devices to make adjustment whilst in-the-wild should be avoided.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Lapland", "University of Lapland"], "authors": ["Ashley Colley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colley:Ashley", "Jonna H\u00e4kkil\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=kkil=auml=:Jonna"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
