In this paper, we describe a wireless communication architecture known as vertical BLAST (Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time) or V-BLAST, which has been implemented in real-time in the laboratory. Using our laboratory prototype, we have demonstrated spectral efficiencies of 20-40 bps/Hz in an indoor propagation environment at realistic SNRs and error rates. To the best of our knowledge, wireless spectral efficiencies of this magnitude are unprecedented and are furthermore unattainable using traditional techniques.", "citation": "Citations (4,915)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Alcatel-Lucent", "Alcatel-Lucent", "Alcatel-Lucent", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Bell Labs", "Alcatel-Lucent", "Alcatel-Lucent", "Alcatel-Lucent", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Stanford University", "University of Western Ontario", "University of Western Ontario", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "School of Physi ... s and Astronomy"], "authors": ["Rebecca Kleinberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleinberger:Rebecca"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
