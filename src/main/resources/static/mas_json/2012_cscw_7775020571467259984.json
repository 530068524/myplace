Automatically establishing  who  is participating in information production or conversation around events can improve event content consumption, help expose the stakeholders in the event and their varied interests, and even help steer subsequent coverage of an event by journalists. In this paper, we take initial steps towards building an automatic classifier for user types on Twitter, focusing on three core user categories that are reflective of the information production and consumption processes around events: organizations, journalists/media bloggers, and ordinary individuals. Exploration of the user categories on a range of events shows distinctive characteristics in terms of the proportion of each user type, as well as differences in the nature of content each shared around the events.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Munmun De Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Munmun_De", "Nicholas Diakopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakopoulos:Nicholas", "Mor Naaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naaman:Mor"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
