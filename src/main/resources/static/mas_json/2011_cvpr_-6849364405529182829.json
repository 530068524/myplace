{"title": "Interreflection removal for photometric stereo by using spectrum-dependent albedo.", "fields": ["ray", "diffuse reflection", "albedo", "photometric stereo", "color image"], "abstract": "We present a novel method that can separate m-bounced light and remove the interreflections in a photometric stereo setup. Under the assumption of a uniformly colored lambertian surface, the intensity of a point in the scene is the sum of 1-bounced light through m-bounced light rays. Ruled by the law of diffuse reflection, whenever a light ray is bounced by the surface, its intensity will be attenuated by the factor of albedo \u03c1. This implies that the measured intensity value can be written as a polynomial function of \u03c1, and the intensity contribution of the m-bounced light rays are expressed by the term of \u03c1 m . Therefore, when we change the surface albedo, the intensity of the m-bounced light is changed to the order of m. This non-linearity gives us the possibility to separate the m-bounced light. In practice, we illuminate the scene with different light colors to effectively simulate different surface albedos since albedo is spectrum dependent. Once the m-bounced light rays are separated, we can perform the photometric stereo algorithm on the 1-bounced light (direct lighting) images to produce the 3D shape without the impact of interreflections. Experiments have shown that we get significantly improved scene reconstruction with a minimum of two color images.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Kentucky", "North Carolina Central University", "University of Kentucky"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Miao Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Miao", "Xinyu Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xinyu", "Ruigang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ruigang"], "pages": 8}
