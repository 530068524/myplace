By offloading compute operations onto intermediate networking devices (e.g., switches, network accelerators, middleboxes), one can (1) serve network requests on the fly with low latency; (2) reduce datacenter traffic and mitigate network congestion; and (3) save energy by running servers in a low-power mode. However, since (1) existing switch technology doesn't provide general computing capabilities, and (2) commodity datacenter networks are complex (e.g., hierarchical fat-tree topologies, multipath communication), enabling in-network computation inside a datacenter is challenging.   In this paper, as a step towards in-network computing, we present IncBricks, an in-network caching fabric with basic computing primitives. IncBricks is a hardware-software co-designed system that supports caching in the network using a programmable network middlebox. As a key-value store accelerator, our prototype lowers request latency by over 30% and doubles throughput for 1024 byte values in a common cluster configuration. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of in-network computing and that efficient datacenter network request processing is possible if we carefully split the computation across the different programmable computing elements in a datacenter, including programmable switches, network accelerators, and end hosts.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Ming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ming", "Liang Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Liang", "Jacob Nelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nelson:Jacob", "Luis Ceze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceze:Luis", "Arvind Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Arvind", "Kishore Atreya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atreya:Kishore"], "pages": 15}
