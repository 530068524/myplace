{"title": "Saving Redundant Messages in BnB-ADOPT.", "fields": ["distributed constraint optimization", "distributed computing", "computer science", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We have found that some messages of BnB-ADOPT are redundant. Removing most of those redundant messages we obtain BnB-ADOPT+, which achieves the optimal solution and terminates. In practice, BnB-ADOPT+ causes substantial reductions on communication costs with respect to the original algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Patricia Gutierrez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gutierrez:Patricia", "Pedro Meseguer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meseguer:Pedro"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
