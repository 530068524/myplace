{"title": "Designing a debugging interaction language for cognitive modelers: an initial case study in natural programming plus.", "fields": ["natural language programming", "first generation programming language", "programming domain", "cognitive model", "programming language specification"], "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate how a debugging environment should support a population doing work at the core of HCI research: cognitive modelers. In conducting this investigation, we extended the Natural Programming methodology (a user-centered design method for HCI researchers of programming environments), to add an explicit method for mapping the outcomes of NP's empirical investigations to a language design. This provided us with a concrete way to make the design leap from empirical assessment of users' needs to a language. The contributions of our work are therefore: (1) empirical evidence about the content and sequence of cognitive modelers' information needs when debugging, (2) a new, empirically derived, design specification for a debugging interaction language for cognitive modelers, and (3) an initial case study of our \"Natural Programming Plus\" methodology.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Air Force Research Laboratory", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Christopher Bogart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogart:Christopher", "Margaret M.
