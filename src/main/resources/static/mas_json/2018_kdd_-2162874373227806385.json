{"title": "Fatigue Prediction in Outdoor Runners Via Machine Learning and Sensor Fusion.", "fields": ["machine learning", "sensor fusion", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "rating of perceived exertion"], "abstract": "Running is extremely popular and around 10.6 million people run regularly in the United States alone. Unfortunately, estimates indicated that between 29% to 79% of runners sustain an overuse injury every year. One contributing factor to such injuries is excessive fatigue, which can result in alterations in how someone runs that increase the risk for an overuse injury. Thus being able to detect during a running session when excessive fatigue sets in, and hence when these alterations are prone to arise, could be of great practical importance. In this paper, we explore whether we can use machine learning to predict the rating of perceived exertion (RPE), a validated subjective measure of fatigue, from inertial sensor data of individuals running outdoors. We describe how both the subjective target label and the realistic outdoor running environment introduce several interesting data science challenges. We collected a longitudinal dataset of runners, and demonstrate that machine learning can be used to learn accurate models for predicting RPE.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Tim Op De Be\u00e9ck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Be=eacute=ck:Tim_Op_De", "Wannes Meert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meert:Wannes", "Kurt Sch\u00fctte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=tte_0002:Kurt", "Benedicte Vanwanseele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanwanseele:Benedicte", "Jesse Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Jesse"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
