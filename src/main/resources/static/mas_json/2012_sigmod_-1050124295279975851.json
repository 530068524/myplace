As the application is running, ConsAD detects and quantifies anomalies indicating exactly the transactions and data items involved. Furthermore, it classifies the detected anomalies into patterns showing the business methods involved as well as their occurrence frequency. ConsAD can guide designers to either choose an isolation level for which their application shows few anomalies or change their transaction design to avoid the anomalies. Its graphical interface shows detailed information about detected anomalies as they occur and analyzes their patterns as well as their distribution.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kamal Zellag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zellag:Kamal", "Bettina Kemme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kemme:Bettina"], "pages": 4}
