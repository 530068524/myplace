For a large family of penalized empirical risk minimization problems, our methods exploit data dependent local smoothness of the loss functions near the optimum, while maintaining convergence guarantees. Our bounds are the first to quantify the advantage gained from local smoothness which are significant for some problems significantly better. Empirically, we provide thorough numerical results to back up our theory. Additionally we present algorithms exploiting local smoothness in more aggressive ways, which perform even better in practice.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Daniel Vainsencher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vainsencher:Daniel", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Han", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Tong"], "pages": 9}
