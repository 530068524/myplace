{"title": "Representation Learning on Graphs with Jumping Knowledge Networks.", "fields": ["citation", "deep learning", "jumping", "feature learning", "graph"], "abstract": "Recent deep learning approaches for representation learning on graphs follow a neighborhood aggregation procedure. We analyze some important properties of these models, and propose a strategy to overcome those. In particular, the range of \"neighboring\" nodes that a node's representation draws from strongly depends on the graph structure, analogous to the spread of a random walk. To adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture -- jumping knowledge (JK) networks -- that flexibly leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models' performance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Keyulu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Keyulu", "Chengtao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chengtao", "Yonglong Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Yonglong", "Tomohiro Sonobe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sonobe:Tomohiro", "Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawarabayashi:Ken=ichi", "Stefanie Jegelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jegelka:Stefanie"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
