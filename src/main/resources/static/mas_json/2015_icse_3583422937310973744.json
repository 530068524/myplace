{"title": "Morpheus: Variability-Aware Refactoring in the Wild.", "fields": ["code refactoring", "correctness", "regression testing", "software system", "conditional compilation", "computer science", "programming language"], "abstract": "Today, many software systems are configurable with  conditional compilation.  Just like any software system, configurable systems need to be refactored in their evolution, but their inherent variability induces an additional dimension of complexity that is not addressed well by current academic and industrial refactoring engines. To improve the state of the art, we propose a  variability-aware refactoring  approach that relies on a canonical variability representation and recent work on variability-aware analysis. The goal is to preserve the behavior of  all  variants of a configurable system, without compromising general applicability and scalability. To demonstrate practicality, we developed M orpheus , a sound, variability-aware refactoring engine for C code with preprocessor directives. We applied M orpheus  to three substantial real-world systems (B usybox , O pen SSL, and SQL ite ) showing that it scales reasonably well, despite of its heavy reliance on satisfiability solvers. By extending a standard approach of testing refactoring engines with support for variability, we provide evidence for the correctness of the refactorings implemented.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau"], "authors": ["J\u00f6rg Liebig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liebig:J=ouml=rg", "Andreas Janker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Janker:Andreas", "Florian Garbe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garbe:Florian", "Sven Apel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apel:Sven", "Christian Lengauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lengauer:Christian"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
