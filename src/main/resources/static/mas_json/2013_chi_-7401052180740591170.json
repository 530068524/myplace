{"title": "Picode: inline photos representing posture data in source code.", "fields": ["multimedia", "source code", "development environment", "robot", "gesture"], "abstract": "Current programming environments use textual or symbolic representations. While these representations are appropriate for describing logical processes, they are not appropriate for representing raw values such as human and robot posture data, which are necessary for handling gesture input and controlling robots. To address this issue, we propose  Picode , a text-based development environment integrated with visual representations: photos of human and robots. With  Picode , the user first takes a photo to bind it to posture data. S/he then drag-and-drops the photo into the code editor, where it is displayed as an inline image. A preliminary in-house user study implied positive effects of taking photos on the programming experience.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Jun Kato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kato_0001:Jun", "Daisuke Sakamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakamoto:Daisuke", "Takeo Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Takeo"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
