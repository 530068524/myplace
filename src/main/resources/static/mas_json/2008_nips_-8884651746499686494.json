{"title": "Using matrices to model symbolic relationship.", "fields": ["multiplication", "novelty", "inverse", "modular arithmetic", "matrix representation"], "abstract": "We describe a way of learning matrix representations of objects and relationships. The goal of learning is to allow multiplication of matrices to represent symbolic relationships between objects and symbolic relationships between relationships, which is the main novelty of the method. We demonstrate that this leads to excellent generalization in two different domains: modular arithmetic and family relationships. We show that the same system can learn first-order propositions such as (2, 5) \u2208 +3 or (Christopher, Penelope) \u2208 has_wife, and higher-order propositions such as (3, +3) \u2208 plus and (+3, -3) \u2208 inverse or (has_husband, has_wife) \u2208 higher_oppsex. We further demonstrate that the system understands how higher-order propositions are related to first-order ones by showing that it can correctly answer questions about first-order propositions involving the relations +3 or has_wife even though it has not been trained on any first-order examples involving these relations.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ilya Sutskever.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sutskever:Ilya", "Geoffrey E.
