As a remedy to this problem, our work proposes a new mechanism to identify queries whose cached results are stale. The basic idea behind our mechanism is to maintain and compare generation time of query results with update times of posting lists and documents to decide on staleness of query results. The proposed technique is evaluated using a Wikipedia document collection with real update information and a real-life query log. We show that our technique has good prediction accuracy, relative to a baseline based on the time-to-live mechanism. Moreover, it is easy to implement and incurs less processing overhead on the system relative to a recently proposed, more sophisticated invalidation mechanism.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Bilkent University", "Bilkent University", "Yahoo!", "Bilkent University", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany"], "authors": ["Sadiye Alici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alici:Sadiye", "Ismail Seng\u00f6r Alting\u00f6vde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alting=ouml=vde:Ismail_Seng=ouml=r", "Rifat Ozcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ozcan:Rifat", "Berkant Barla Cambazoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cambazoglu:Berkant_Barla", "\u00d6zg\u00fcr Ulusoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ulusoy:=Ouml=zg=uuml=r"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
