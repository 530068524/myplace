It is, however, susceptible to environmental unknowns from both temporal and spatial domains. As a result, the fluctuation of RSS may degrade performance of RSS based applications. In this work, we propose a novel RSS processing method at the receiver for three antenna based systems. The output of our approach is `RSS-Ratio', which eliminates the environmental unknowns and thus is a more stable variable compared to RSS itself. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments in a range of wireless scenarios, including indoor laptop based measurement, indoor software defined radio - WARP based measurement, and outdoor wireless measurement. In addition, we also give an analysis to the relationship between the location of transmitter and the value of RSS-Ratio, and examine the accuracy of the estimated RSS-Ratio value via both simulations and experiments. All the experimental, analytical, and simulated results demonstrate that RSS-Ratio will be a better replacement for RSS to improve the performance of RSS based applications.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Lowell", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Wei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wei", "Kefeng Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kefeng", "Victor Omwando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Omwando:Victor", "Jindan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jindan", "Prasant Mohapatra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohapatra:Prasant"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
