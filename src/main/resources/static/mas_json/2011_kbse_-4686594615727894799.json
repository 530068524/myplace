{"title": "An adaptive approach to impact analysis from change requests to source code.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "latent semantic indexing", "kpi driven code analysis", "snapshot", "change request"], "abstract": "The paper presents an adaptive approach to perform impact analysis from a given change request (e.g., a bug report) to source code. Given a textual change request, a single snapshot (release) of source code, indexed using Latent Semantic Indexing, is used to estimate the impact set. Additionally, the approach configures the best-fit combination of information retrieval, dynamic analysis, and data mining of past source code commits to produce an improved impact set. The tandem operation of the three techniques sets it apart from other related solutions.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "Wichita State University", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Malcom Gethers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gethers:Malcom", "Huzefa H.
