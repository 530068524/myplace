{"title": "ITACA: An integrated toolbox for the automatic composition and adaptation of Web services.", "fields": ["web service", "toolbox", "deadlock", "interoperability", "software"], "abstract": "Adaptation is of utmost importance in systems developed by assembling reusable software services accessed through their public interfaces. This process aims at solving, as automatically as possible, mismatch cases which may be given at the different interoperability levels among interfaces by synthesizing a mediating adaptor. In this paper, we present a toolbox that fully supports the adaptation process, including: (i) different methods to construct adaptation contracts involving several services; (ii) simulation and verification techniques which help to identify and correct erroneous behaviours or deadlocking executions; and (iii) techniques for the generation of centralized or distributed adaptor protocols based on the aforementioned contracts. Our toolbox relates our models with implementation platforms, starting with the automatic extraction of behavioural models from existing interface descriptions, until the final adaptor implementation is generated for the target platform.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["University of M\u00e1laga", "University of M\u00e1laga", "University of M\u00e1laga", "University of M\u00e1laga", "University of M\u00e1laga"], "authors": ["Javier C\u00e1mara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/C=aacute=mara:Javier", "Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mart\u00edn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mart=iacute=n:Jos=eacute=_Antonio", "Gwen Sala\u00fcn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sala=uuml=n:Gwen", "Javier Cubo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cubo:Javier", "Meriem Ouederni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouederni:Meriem", "Carlos Canal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canal:Carlos", "Ernesto Pimentel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pimentel:Ernesto"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
