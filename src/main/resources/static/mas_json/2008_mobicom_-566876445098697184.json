{"title": "WiMAX relay networks: opportunistic scheduling to exploit multiuser diversity and frequency selectivity.", "fields": ["job shop scheduling", "rate monotonic scheduling", "fair share scheduling", "round robin scheduling", "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"], "abstract": "We study the problem of scheduling in OFDMA-based relay networks with emphasis on IEEE 802.16j based WiMAX relay networks. In such networks, in addition to a base station, multiple relay stations are used for enhancing the throughput, and/or improving the range of the base station. We solve the problem of MAC scheduling in such networks so as to serve the mobiles in a fair manner while exploiting the multiuser diversity, as well as the frequency selectivity of the wireless channel. The scheduling resources consist of tiles in a two-dimensional scheduling frame with time slots along one axis, and frequency bands or sub-channels along the other axis. The resource allocation problem has to be solved once every scheduling frame which is about 5 - 10 ms long. While the original scheduling problem is computationally complex, we provide an easy-to-compute upper bound on the optimum. We also propose three fast heuristic algorithms that perform close to the optimum (within 99.5%), and outperform other algorithms such as OFDM 2 A proposed in the past. Through extensive simulation results, we demonstrate the benefits of relaying in throughput enhancement (an improvement in the median throughput of about 25%), and feasibility of range extension (for  e.g. , 7 relays can be used to extend the cell-radius by 60% but mean throughput reduces by 36%). Our algorithms are easy to implement, and have an average running time of less than 0.05 ms making them appropriate for WiMAX relay networks.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Motorola", "Indian Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Supratim Deb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deb:Supratim", "Vivek Mhatre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mhatre:Vivek", "Venkatesh Ramaiyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramaiyan:Venkatesh"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
