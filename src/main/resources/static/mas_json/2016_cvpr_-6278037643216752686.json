{"title": "Sublabel-Accurate Relaxation of Nonconvex Energies.", "fields": ["regular polygon", "mathematical optimization", "discrete mathematics", "grid bias", "piecewise"], "abstract": "We propose a novel spatially continuous framework for convex relaxations based on functional lifting. Our method can be interpreted as a sublabel\u2013accurate solution to multilabel problems. We show that previously proposed functional lifting methods optimize an energy which is linear between two labels and hence require (often infinitely) many labels for a faithful approximation. In contrast, the proposed formulation is based on a piecewise convex approximation and therefore needs far fewer labels \u2013 see Fig. 1. In comparison to recent MRF-based approaches, our method is formulated in a spatially continuous setting and shows less grid bias. Moreover, in a local sense, our formulation is the tightest possible convex relaxation. It is easy to implement and allows an efficient primal-dual optimization on GPUs. We show the effectiveness of our approach on several computer vision problems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Cambridge", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Thomas M\u00f6llenhoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=ouml=llenhoff:Thomas", "Emanuel Laude.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laude:Emanuel", "Michael M\u00f6ller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=ouml=ller_0001:Michael", "Jan Lellmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lellmann:Jan", "Daniel Cremers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cremers:Daniel"], "pages": 9}
