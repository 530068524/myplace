{"title": "Toward real-time and cooperative mobile visual sensing and sharing.", "fields": ["data mining", "social media", "redundancy", "multimedia", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "Mobile social media enables people to record ongoing physical events they witness and share them instantaneously online. However, since these event pictures are often individually provided, they are typically fragmented and possess high redundancy. Though there have been studies about visual event summarization, they pay little attention to collaborative sensing, subevent detection, and event summary. In this paper, we present several building blocks for a cooperative visual sensing and sharing system. We create a virtual opportunistic community associated with an event, where members collaborate to cover different aspects of the event. More specifically, a crowd-powered approach is first used to localize the event. We then propose three subevent segmentation methods based on crowd-event interaction patterns. Based on the segmentation results, we summarize the event at two levels: multi-facet subevent summary and crowd-behavior-based highlights. Experiments over 21 online datasets and two real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Colorado School of Mines"], "authors": ["Huihui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Huihui", "Bin Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Bin", "Zhiwen Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Zhiwen", "Qi Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Qi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
