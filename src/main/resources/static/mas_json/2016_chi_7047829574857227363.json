{"title": "Forget-me-not: History-less Mobile Messaging.", "fields": ["mobile instant messaging", "unified communications", "mobile technology", "thread", "computer mediated communication"], "abstract": "Text messaging has long been a popular activity, and today smartphone apps enable users to choose from a plethora of mobile messaging applications. While we know a lot about SMS practices, we know less about practices of messaging applications. In this paper, we take a first step to explore one ubiquitous aspect of mobile messaging -- messaging history. We designed, built, and trialled a mobile messaging application without history named forget-me-not. The two-week trial showed that history-less messaging no longer supports chit-chat as seen in e.g. WhatsApp, but is still considered conversational and more 'engaging'. Participants expressed being lenient and relaxed about what they wrote. Removing the history allowed us to gain insights into what uses history has in other mobile messaging applications, such as planning events, allowing for distractions, and maintaining multiple conversation threads.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mattias Rost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rost:Mattias", "Christos Kitsos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kitsos:Christos", "Alexander Morgan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morgan:Alexander", "Martin Podlubny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podlubny:Martin", "Pietro Romeo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romeo:Pietro", "Edoardo Russo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Russo:Edoardo", "Matthew Chalmers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chalmers:Matthew"], "pages": 5}
