Assume that a sensor networks is defined as a connected unit disk graph (UDG). The problem is to find a minimum connected dominating set of given UDG with minimum routing cost for each node pair. We present a constant approximation scheme which produces a connected dominating set D, whose size |D| is within a factor \u03b1 from that of the minimum connected dominating set and each node pair exists a routing path with all intermediate nodes in D and with length at most 5 \u00b7 d(u,v), where d(u,v) is the length of shortest path of this node pair. A distributed algorithm is also provided with analogical performance. Extensive simulation shows that our distributed algorithm achieves significantly than the latest solution in research direction.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["University of Prince Edward Island", "University of Prince Edward Island", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Korea University", "Renmin University of China"], "authors": ["Hongwei Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Hongwei", "Qiang Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Qiang", "Weili Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Weili", "Wonjun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wonjun", "Deying Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Deying", "Ding-Zhu Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Ding=Zhu", "Stephen Howard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Howard:Stephen"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 8}
