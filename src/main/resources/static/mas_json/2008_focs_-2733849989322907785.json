{"title": "Near-Optimal Sparse Recovery in the L1 Norm.", "fields": ["approximation error", "sketch", "streaming algorithm", "compressed sensing", "sparse matrix"], "abstract": "We consider the approximate sparse recovery problem, where the goal is to (approximately) recover a high-dimensional vector xisinRopf n  from its lower-dimensional sketch AxisinRopf m . Specifically, we focus on the sparse recovery problem in the L 1  norm: for a parameter k, given the sketch Ax, compute an approximation xcirc of x such that the L 1  approximation error parx-xcircpar 1  is close to min x'  parx-x'par 1 , where x' ranges over all vectors with at most k terms. The sparse recovery problem has been subject to extensive research over the last few years. Many solutions to this problem have been discovered, achieving different trade-offs between various attributes, such as the sketch length, encoding and recovery times. In this paper we provide a sparse recovery scheme which achieves close to optimal performance on virtually all attributes (see Figure 1). In particular, this is the first recovery scheme that guarantees O(k log(n/k)) sketch length, and near-linear O(n log (n/k)) recovery time simultaneously. It also features low encoding and update times, and is noise-resilient.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "ITU Copenhagen, Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Piotr Indyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Indyk:Piotr", "Milan Ruzic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruzic:Milan"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
