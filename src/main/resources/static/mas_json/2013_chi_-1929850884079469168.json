The smallest displacement they can detect gets smaller, but little is known on our ability to control such small movements. Small target acquisition has been previously tackled, but the findings do not apply to the problem of finding the  useful resolution  of a user with a mouse, which corresponds to the smallest displacement (s)he can reliably produce with that device. We detail this definition and provide an associated experimental protocol to measure it. We then report on the results of a study suggesting that high-end mice are not likely to be used to their full potential. We further comment on the different strategies used by participants to acheive best performance, and derive implications for user interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "university of lille", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Jonathan Aceituno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aceituno:Jonathan", "G\u00e9ry Casiez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casiez:G=eacute=ry", "Nicolas Roussel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roussel:Nicolas"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
