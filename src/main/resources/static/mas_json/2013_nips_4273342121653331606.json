We reduce questions of transportability from multiple domains and with limited scope to symbolic derivations in the causal calculus, thus extending the original setting of transportability introduced in [1], which assumes only one domain with full experimental information available. We further provide different graphical and algorithmic conditions for computing the transport formula in this setting, that is, a way of fusing the observational and experimental information scattered throughout different domains to synthesize a consistent estimate of the desired effects in the target domain. We also consider the issue of minimizing the variance of the produced estimand in order to increase power.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Elias Bareinboim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bareinboim:Elias", "Sanghack Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sanghack", "Vasant G.
