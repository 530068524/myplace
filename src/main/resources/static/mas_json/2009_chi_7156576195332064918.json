However, a kindergarten is a delicate social fabric that mixes professional roles (the teachers') with socio-emotional relationships (parenting and caring) and involves stakeholders who are dependent on adults in the use of technology (the children). To date, no studies have been reported that critically examine the boundary conditions for successful mobile media applications in such settings. We present a study of Meaning, a one-button capture-and-push-to-Web solution that was used by a Finnish kindergarten for a month. Interviews and the amount of media sent suggest that the intervention was a success, and we report on seven uses of media. However, all uses were critically affected by the users' social fabric, in which the teachers were the nexus. We conclude by discussing various ways in which the heterogeneity of the user group affected mobile media use.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jaana N\u00e4s\u00e4nen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/N=auml=s=auml=nen:Jaana", "Antti Oulasvirta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oulasvirta:Antti", "Asko Lehmuskallio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehmuskallio:Asko"], "pages": 10}
