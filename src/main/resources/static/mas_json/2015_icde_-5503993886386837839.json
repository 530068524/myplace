{"title": "selP: Selective tracking and presentation of data provenance.", "fields": ["knowledge based systems", "datalog", "pattern matching", "provenance", "information extraction"], "abstract": "Highly expressive declarative languages, such as Datalog, are now commonly used to model the operational logic of data-intensive applications. The typical complexity of such Datalog programs, and the large volume of data that they process, call for the tracking and presentation of data provenance. Provenance information is crucial for explaining and justifying the Datalog program results. However, the size of full provenance information is in many cases too large (and its concise representations are too complex) to allow its presentation to the user. To this end, we propose a demonstration of selP, a system that allows the selective presentation of provenance, based on user-specified top-k queries. We will demonstrate the usefulness of selP using a real-life program and data, in the context of Information Extraction.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Daniel Deutch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deutch:Daniel", "Amir Gilad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilad:Amir", "Yuval Moskovitch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moskovitch:Yuval"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
