Stochastic game (SG), together with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), offers a systematic framework for the study of information warfare in current and emerging cyber-physical systems. In practical security games, each player usually has only incomplete information about the opponent, which induces information asymmetry. This work exploits information asymmetry from a new angle, considering how to exploit local information unknown to the opponent to the player's advantage. Two new MARL algorithms, termed minimax-PDS and WoLF-PDS, are proposed, which enable the LS to learn and adapt faster in dynamic environments by exploiting its private local information. The proposed algorithms are provably convergent and rational, respectively. Also, numerical results are presented to show their effectiveness through two concrete anti-jamming examples.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Xiaofan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaofan", "Huaiyu Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Huaiyu", "Peng Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Peng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
