{"title": "Towards a unified architecture for in-RDBMS analytics.", "fields": ["source lines of code", "scratch", "relational database management system", "root cause", "software analytics"], "abstract": "The increasing use of statistical data analysis in enterprise applications has created an arms race among database vendors to offer ever more sophisticated in-database analytics. One challenge in this race is that each new statistical technique must be implemented from scratch in the RDBMS, which leads to a lengthy and complex development process. We argue that the root cause for this overhead is the lack of a unified architecture for in-database analytics. Our main contribution in this work is to take a step towards such a unified architecture. A key benefit of our unified architecture is that performance optimizations for analytics techniques can be studied generically instead of an ad hoc, per-technique fashion. In particular, our technical contributions are theoretical and empirical studies of two key factors that we found impact performance: the order data is stored, and parallelization of computations on a single-node multicore RDBMS. We demonstrate the feasibility of our architecture by integrating several popular analytics techniques into two commercial and one open-source RDBMS. Our architecture requires changes to only a few dozen lines of code to integrate a new statistical technique. We then compare our approach with the native analytics tools offered by the commercial RDBMSes on various analytics tasks, and validate that our approach achieves competitive or higher performance, while still achieving the same quality.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xixuan Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Xixuan", "Arun Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Arun", "Benjamin Recht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Recht:Benjamin", "Christopher R\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=eacute=:Christopher"], "pages": 12}
