The bound even holds if the one-way function is guaranteed to be regular. In this case it matches the best known construction due to Gold Reich, Krawczyk, and Luby (SIAM J. Comp. 22, 1993), which uses O(n/log(n)) calls.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "University of Washington"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Thomas Holenstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holenstein:Thomas", "Makrand Sinha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinha:Makrand"], "pages": 10}
