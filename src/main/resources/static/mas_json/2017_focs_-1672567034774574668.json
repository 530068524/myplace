We introduce a generic method for increasing the approximate degree of a given function, while preserving its computability by constant-depth circuits.Specifically, we show how to transform any Boolean function f with approximate degree d into a function F on O(n polylog(n)) variables with approximate degree at least D = \u03a9(n^{1/3} d^{2/3}). In particular, if d = n^{1-\u03a9(1), then D is polynomially larger than d. Moreover, if f is computed by a constant-depth polynomial-size Boolean circuit, then so is F.By recursively applying our transformation, for any constant \u03b4 0 we exhibit an AC\u00b0 function of approximate degree \u03a9(n^{1-\u03b4}). This improves over the best previous lower bound of \u03a9(n^{2/3}) due to Aaronson and Shi (J. ACM 2004), and nearly matches the trivial upper bound of n that holds for any function. Our lower bounds also apply to (quasipolynomial-size) DNFs of polylogarithmic width.We describe several applications of these results. We give:\u2022 For any constant \u03b4 0, an \u03a9(n^{1-\u03b4}) lower bound on the quantum communication complexity of a function in AC\u00b0.\u2022 A Boolean function f with approximate degree at least C(f)^{2-o(1), where C(f) is the certificate complexity of f. This separation is optimal up to the o(1) term in the exponent.\u2022 Improved secret sharing schemes with reconstruction procedures in AC\u00b0.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Georgetown University"], "authors": ["Mark Bun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bun:Mark", "Justin Thaler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thaler:Justin"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
