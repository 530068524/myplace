However, conventional hallucination methods are often designed for controlled settings and cannot handle varying conditions of pose, resolution degree, and blur. In this paper, we present a new method of face hallucination, which can consistently improve the resolution of face images even with large appearance variations. Our method is based on a novel network architecture called Bi-channel Convolutional Neural Network (Bi-channel CNN). It extracts robust face representations from raw input by using deep convolu-tional network, then adaptively integrates two channels of information (the raw input image and face representations) to predict the high-resolution image. Experimental results show our system outperforms the prior state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Megvii Technolo ...
