{"title": "Integrating Task Planning and Interactive Learning for Robots to Work in Human Environments.", "fields": ["operator", "planner", "probabilistic logic", "scalability", "interactive learning"], "abstract": "Human environments are challenging for robots, which need to be trainable by lay people and learn new behaviours rapidly without disrupting much the ongoing activity. A system that integrates AI techniques for planning and learning is here proposed to satisfy these strong demands. The approach rapidly learns planning operators from few action experiences using a competitive strategy where many alternatives of cause-effect explanations are evaluated in parallel, and the most successful ones are used to generate the operators. The success of a cause-effect explanation is evaluated by a probabilistic estimate that compensates the lack of experience, producing more confident estimations and speeding up the learning in relation to other known estimates. The system operates without task interruption by integrating in the planning-learning loop a human teacher that supports the planner in making decisions. All the mechanisms are integrated and synchronized in the robot using a general decision-making framework. The feasibility and scalability of the architecture are evaluated in two different robot platforms: a Staubli arm, and the humanoid ARMAR III.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council", "Bernstein Cente ... ingen, Germany"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Alejandro Agostini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agostini:Alejandro", "Carme Torras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torras:Carme", "Florentin W\u00f6rg\u00f6tter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/W=ouml=rg=ouml=tter:Florentin"], "pages": 6}
