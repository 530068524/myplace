We study the topic under two standard settings\u2014multi-armed bandits and hidden bipartite graphs\u2014which differ in the nature of the input distributions. In the former setting, each distribution can be sampled (in the i.i.d. manner) an arbitrary number of times, whereas in the latter, each distribution is defined on a population of a finite size m (and hence, is fully revealed after m samples). For both settings, we prove lower bounds on the total number of samples needed, and propose optimal algorithms whose sample complexities match those lower bounds.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Wei Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Wei", "Jian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0015:Jian", "Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei", "Zhize Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhize"], "pages": 9}
