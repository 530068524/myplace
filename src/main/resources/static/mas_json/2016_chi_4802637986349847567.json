{"title": "Revising Learner Misconceptions Without Feedback: Prompting for Reflection on Anomalies.", "fields": ["multimedia", "remedial education", "the internet", "randomized experiment", "computer science"], "abstract": "The Internet has enabled learning at scale, from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to Wikipedia. But online learners may become passive, instead of actively constructing knowledge and revising their beliefs in light of new facts. Instructors cannot directly diagnose thousands of learners' misconceptions and provide remedial tutoring. This paper investigates how instructors can prompt learners to reflect on facts that are anomalies with respect to their existing misconceptions, and how to choose these anomalies and prompts to guide learners to revise incorrect beliefs without any feedback. We conducted two randomized experiments with online crowd workers learning statistics. Results show that prompts to explain why these anomalies are true drive revision towards correct beliefs. But prompts to simply articulate thoughts about anomalies have no effect on learning. Furthermore, we find that explaining multiple anomalies is more effective than explaining only one, but the anomalies should rule out multiple misconceptions simultaneously.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Harvard University", "University of California, Berkeley", "Queen Mary University of London", "Harvard University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Joseph Jay Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Joseph_Jay", "Tania Lombrozo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lombrozo:Tania", "Anne Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Anne", "Bernd Huber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huber:Bernd", "Juho Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Juho"], "pages": 5}
