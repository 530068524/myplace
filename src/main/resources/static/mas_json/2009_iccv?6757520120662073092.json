However, few work on this issue has been done in the past several years because of its technical challenges and the lack of appropriate databases. Recently, a 3D facial expression database (BU-3DFE database) is collected by Yin et al. [10] and has attracted some researchers to study this issue. Based on the BU-3DFE database, in this paper we propose a novel approach to expression recognition from non-frontal view facial images. The novelty of the proposed method lies in recognizing the multi-view expressions under the unified Bayes theoretical framework, where the recognition problem can be formulated as an optimization problem of minimizing an upper bound of Bayes error. We also propose a close-form solution method based on the power iteration approach and rank-one update (ROU) technique to find the optimal solutions of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on BU-3DFE database with 100 subjects and 5 yaw rotation view angles demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Microsoft Research Asia (China)", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Wenming Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Wenming", "Hao Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Hao", "Zhouchen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhouchen", "Thomas S.
