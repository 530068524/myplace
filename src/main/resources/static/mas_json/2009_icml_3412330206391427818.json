Partial order constraints arise naturally when modeling human perception of similarity. Our partial order framework enables the use of graph-theoretic tools to more efficiently produce the embedding, and exploit global structure within the constraint set.   We present an embedding algorithm based on semidefinite programming, which can be parameterized by multiple kernels to yield a unified space from heterogeneous features.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Brian McFee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McFee:Brian", "Gert R.
