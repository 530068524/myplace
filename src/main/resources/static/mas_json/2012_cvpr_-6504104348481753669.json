First we show that generating matrices can be used for formulating LDA with increasing training samples, then analyze them as image processing operators acting on 2D continuous functions for compressing many large generating matrices by using PCA and Hermite decomposition. Then we propose Linear Discriminative Image Processing Operator Analysis, an iterative method for estimating LDA feature space along with a discriminative set of generating matrices. In experiments, we demonstrate that discriminative generating matrices outperform a non-discriminative set on the ORL and FERET datasets.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Hiroshima University", "Hiroshima University", "Hiroshima University", "Hiroshima University", "Hiroshima University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Toru Tamaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamaki:Toru", "Bingzhi Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Bingzhi", "Kengo Harada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harada:Kengo", "Bisser Raytchev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raytchev:Bisser", "Kazufumi Kaneda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaneda:Kazufumi"], "pages": 7}
