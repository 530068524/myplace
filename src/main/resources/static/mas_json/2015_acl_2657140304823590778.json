{"title": "Optimal Shift-Reduce Constituent Parsing with Structured Perceptron.", "fields": ["merge", "perceptron", "conditional random field", "template", "parsing"], "abstract": "We present a constituent shift-reduce parser with a structured perceptron that finds the optimal parse in a practical runtime. The key ideas are new feature templates that facilitate state merging of dynamic programming and A* search. Our system achieves 91.1 F1 on a standard English experiment, a level which cannot be reached by other beam-based systems even with large beam sizes.1", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Le Quang Thang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thang:Le_Quang", "Hiroshi Noji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noji:Hiroshi", "Yusuke Miyao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miyao:Yusuke"], "pages": 11}
