{"title": "An Experimental Evaluation of Regret-Based Econometrics.", "fields": ["econometrics", "behavioral economics", "valuation", "cognitive bias", "regret"], "abstract": "Using data obtained in a controlled ad-auction experiment that we ran, we evaluate the regret-based approach to econometrics that was recently suggested by Nekipelov, Syrgkanis, and Tardos (EC 2015). We found that despite the weak regret-based assumptions, the results were (at least) as accurate as those obtained using classic equilibrium-based assumptions. En route we studied to what extent humans actually minimize regret in our ad auction, and found a significant difference between the ``high types'' (players with a high valuation) who indeed rationally minimized regret and the ``low types'' who significantly overbid. We suggest that correcting for these biases and adjusting the regret-based econometric method may improve the accuracy of estimated values.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Noam Nisan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nisan:Noam", "Gali Noti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noti:Gali"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
