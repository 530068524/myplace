A novel marginal density estimator is introduced and shown both analytically and empirically to outperform standard estimators by several orders of magnitude. The developed theory and algorithms apply to a broad class of probabilistic models including statistical relational models considered not susceptible to lifted probabilistic inference.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Washington"], "authors": ["Mathias Niepert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niepert:Mathias"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
