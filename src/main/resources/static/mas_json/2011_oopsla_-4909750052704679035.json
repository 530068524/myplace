This trend, however, is not yet reflected by the benchmark suites commonly used in JVM research. In this paper, we thus present the design and analysis of the first full-fledged benchmark suite for Scala. We furthermore compare the benchmarks contained therein with those from the well-known DaCapo 9.12 benchmark suite and show where the differences are between Scala and Java code---and where not.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Andreas Sewe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sewe:Andreas", "Mira Mezini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mezini:Mira", "Aibek Sarimbekov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarimbekov:Aibek", "Walter Binder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binder:Walter"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2011", "pages": 20}
