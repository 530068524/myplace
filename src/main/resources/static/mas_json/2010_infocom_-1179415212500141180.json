However, most of the existing results are limited to single-hop wireless networks. To illustrate the benefits of CC in multi-hop wireless networks, we solve a joint optimization problem of relay node assignment and flow routing for concurrent sessions. We study this problem via mathematical modeling and solve it using a solution procedure based on the branch-and-cut framework. We design several novel components to speed-up the computation time of branch-and-cut. Via numerical results, we show the significant rate gains that can be achieved by incorporating CC in multi-hop networks.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "United States Naval Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Sushant Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Sushant", "Yi Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi_0001:Yi", "Y.
