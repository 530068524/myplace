To address the comment scarcity issue, we propose a new automatic comment generation approach, which mines comments from a large programming Question and Answer (Q&A) site. Q&A sites allow programmers to post questions and receive solutions, which contain code segments together with their descriptions, referred to as  code-description mappings . We develop  AutoComment  to extract such mappings, and leverage them to generate description comments automatically for similar code segments matched in open-source projects. We apply AutoComment to analyze Java and Android tagged Q&A posts to extract 132,767 code-description mappings, which help AutoComment to generate 102 comments automatically for 23 Java and Android projects. The user study results show that the majority of the participants consider the generated comments accurate, adequate, concise, and useful in helping them understand the code.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Univ. of Waterl ... loo, ON, Canada", "Univ. of Waterl ... loo, ON, Canada", "Univ. of Waterl ... loo, ON, Canada"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Edmund Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Edmund", "Jinqiu Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jinqiu", "Lin Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Lin"], "pages": 6}
