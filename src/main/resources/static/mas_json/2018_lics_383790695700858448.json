{"title": "A Complete Axiomatisation of the ZX-Calculus for Clifford+T Quantum Mechanics.", "fields": ["diagrammatic reasoning", "axiom", "quantum probability", "quantum algorithm", "categorical quantum mechanics"], "abstract": "We introduce the first complete and approximately universal diagrammatic language for quantum mechanics. We make the ZX-Calculus, a diagrammatic language introduced by Coecke and Duncan, complete for the so-called Clifford+T quantum mechanics by adding two new axioms to the language. The completeness of the ZX-Calculus for Clifford+T quantum mechanics -- also called the \u03c0/4-fragment of the ZX-Calculus -- was one of the main open questions in categorical quantum mechanics. We prove the completeness of this fragment using the recently studied ZW-Calculus, a calculus dealing with integer matrices. We also prove that the \u03c0/4-fragment of the ZX-Calculus represents exactly all the matrices over some finite dimensional extension of the ring of dyadic rationals.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Lorraine", "University of Lorraine", "University of Lorraine"], "authors": ["Emmanuel Jeandel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeandel:Emmanuel", "Simon Perdrix.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perdrix:Simon", "Renaud Vilmart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vilmart:Renaud"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
