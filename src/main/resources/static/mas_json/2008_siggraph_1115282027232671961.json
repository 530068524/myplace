{"title": "Superimposing dynamic range.", "fields": ["electronic paper", "color space", "high dynamic range", "tone mapping", "superimposition"], "abstract": "We present a simple and cost-efficient way of extending contrast, perceived tonal resolution, and color space of reflective media, such as paper prints, hardcopy photographs, or electronic paper displays. A calibrated projector-camera system is applied for automatic registration, radiometric scanning and superimposition. A second modulation of the projected light on the surface of such media results in a high dynamic range visualization. This holds application potential for a variety of domains, such as radiology, astronomy, optical microscopy, conservation and restoration of historic art, modern art and entertainment installations.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Bauhaus University, Weimar", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Oliver Bimber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bimber:Oliver", "Daisuke Iwai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwai:Daisuke"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2008", "pages": 1}
