{"title": "Web video categorization based on Wikipedia categories and content-duplicated open resources.", "fields": ["information retrieval", "categorization", "voting", "discriminative model", "search engine"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for web video categorization by leveraging Wikipedia categories (WikiCs) and open resources describing the same content as the video, i.e., content-duplicated open resources (CDORs). Note that current approaches only collect CDORs within one or a few media forms and ignore CDORs of other forms. We explore all these resources by utilizing WikiCs and commercial search engines. Given a web video, its discriminative Wikipedia concepts are first identified and classified. Then a textual query is constructed and from which CDORs are collected. Based on these CDORs, we propose to categorize web videos in the space spanned by WikiCs rather than that spanned by raw tags. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed CDOR collection method and the WikiC voting categorization algorithm. In addition, the categorization model built based on both WikiCs and CDORs achieves better performance compared with the models built based on only one of them as well as state-of-the-art approach.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Zhineng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhineng", "Juan Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Juan", "Yicheng Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yicheng", "Yongdong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yongdong", "Jintao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jintao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
