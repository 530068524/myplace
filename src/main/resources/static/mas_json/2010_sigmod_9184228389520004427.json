{"title": "Towards proximity pattern mining in large graphs.", "fields": ["malware", "isomorphism", "probabilistic logic", "normalization", "intrusion"], "abstract": "Mining graph patterns in large networks is critical to a variety of applications such as malware detection and biological module discovery. However, frequent subgraphs are often ineffective to capture association existing in these applications, due to the complexity of isomorphism testing and the inelastic pattern definition.   In this paper, we introduce proximity pattern which is a significant departure from the traditional concept of frequent subgraphs. Defined as a set of labels that co-occur in neighborhoods, proximity pattern blurs the boundary between itemset and structure. It relaxes the rigid structure constraint of frequent subgraphs, while introducing connectivity to frequent itemsets. Therefore, it can benefit from both: efficient mining in itemsets and structure proximity from graphs. We developed two models to define proximity patterns. The second one, called  Normalized Probabilistic Association  (NmPA), is able to transform a complex graph mining problem to a simplified probabilistic itemset mining problem, which can be solved eficiently by a modified FP-tree algorithm, called pFP. NmPA and pFP are evaluated on real-life social and intrusion networks. Empirical results show that it not only finds interesting patterns that are ignored by the existing approaches, but also achieves high performance for finding proximity patterns in large-scale graphs.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "IBM"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Arijit Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Arijit", "Xifeng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Xifeng", "Kun-Lung Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Kun=Lung"], "pages": 12}
