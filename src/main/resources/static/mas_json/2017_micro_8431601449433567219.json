Thus, optimizing the performance and energy consumption of video processing in mobile devices is critical for sustaining the handheld market growth. In this paper, we propose three complementary techniques,  race-to-sleep, content caching  and  display caching , to minimize the energy consumption of the video processing flows. Unlike the state-of-the-art frame-by-frame processing of a video decoder, the first scheme,  race-to-sleep , uses two approaches, called  batching of frames  and  frequency boosting  to prolong its sleep state for saving energy, while avoiding any frame drops. The second scheme,  content caching , exploits the content similarity of smaller video blocks, called macroblocks, to design a novel cache organization for reducing the memory pressure. The third scheme, in turn, takes advantage of content similarity at the display controller to facilitate  display caching  further improving energy efficiency. We integrate these three schemes for developing an end-to-end video processing framework and evaluate our design on a comprehensive mobile system design platform with a variety of video processing workloads. Our evaluations show that the proposed three techniques complement each other in improving performance by avoiding frame drops and reducing the energy consumption of video streaming applications by 21%, on average, compared to the current baseline design.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Haibo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haibo", "Prasanna Venkatesh Rengasamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rengasamy:Prasanna_Venkatesh", "Shulin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shulin", "Nachiappan Chidambaram Nachiappan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nachiappan:Nachiappan_Chidambaram", "Anand Sivasubramaniam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sivasubramaniam:Anand", "Mahmut T.
