We aim to reconstruct a 3D model using images observed from a planned sequence of informative and discriminative views. But where are such informative and discriminative views around an object? To address this we propose a unified model for view planning and object reconstruction, which is utilized to learn a guided information acquisition model and to aggregate information from a sequence of images for reconstruction. Experiments show that our model (1) increases our reconstruction accuracy with an increasing number of views (2) and generally predicts a more informative sequence of views for object reconstruction compared to other alternative methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dalian University of Technology", "City University of Hong Kong", "Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology"], "authors": ["Xin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xin", "Yuanbo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuanbo", "Yaru Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yaru", "Baocai Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Baocai", "Qiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0008:Qiang", "Xiaopeng Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Xiaopeng", "Hongbo Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Hongbo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
