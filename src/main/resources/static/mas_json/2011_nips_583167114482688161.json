{"title": "Beating SGD: Learning SVMs in Sublinear Time.", "fields": ["beat", "training set", "support vector machine", "sublinear function", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present an optimization approach for linear SVMs based on a stochastic primal-dual approach, where the primal step is akin to an importance-weighted SGD, and the dual step is a stochastic update on the importance weights. This yields an optimization method with a sublinear dependence on the training set size, and the first method for learning linear SVMs with runtime less then the size of the training set required for learning!", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Toyota Technological Institute"], "authors": ["Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad", "Tomer Koren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koren:Tomer", "Nati Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nati"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
