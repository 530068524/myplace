{"title": "Real-time visual tracking using compressive sensing.", "fields": ["compressed sensing", "sparse approximation", "bittorrent tracker", "dimensionality reduction", "video tracking"], "abstract": "The l 1  tracker obtains robustness by seeking a sparse representation of the tracking object via l 1  norm minimization. However, the high computational complexity involved in the l 1  tracker may hamper its applications in real-time processing scenarios. Here we propose Real-time Com-pressive Sensing Tracking (RTCST) by exploiting the signal recovery power of Compressive Sensing (CS). Dimensionality reduction and a customized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm are adopted to accelerate the CS tracking. As a result, our algorithm achieves a realtime speed that is up to 5,000 times faster than that of the l 1  tracker. Meanwhile, RTCST still produces competitive (sometimes even superior) tracking accuracy compared to the l 1  tracker. Furthermore, for a stationary camera, a refined tracker is designed by integrating a CS-based background model (CSBM) into tracking. This CSBM-equipped tracker, termed RTCST-B, outperforms most state-of-the-art trackers in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Finally, our experimental results on various video sequences, which are verified by a new metric \u2014 Tracking Success Probability (TSP), demonstrate the excellence of the proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (362)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["NICTA", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hanxi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hanxi", "Chunhua Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chunhua", "Qinfeng Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Qinfeng"], "pages": 8}
