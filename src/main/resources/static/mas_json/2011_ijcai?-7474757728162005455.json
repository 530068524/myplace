In this paper, we proposed a novel method RCRank to jointly compute concept-concept relatedness and concept-category relatedness base on the assumption that information carried in concept-concept links and concept-category links can mutually reinforce each other. Different from previous work, RCRank can not only find semantically related concepts but also interpret their relations by categories. Experimental results on concept recommendation and relation interpretation show that our method substantially outperforms classical methods.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Fan Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Fan", "Yu Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Yu", "Xiaoyan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoyan"], "pages": 6}
