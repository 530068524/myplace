{"title": "End-to-end Performance Isolation Through Virtual Datacenters.", "fields": ["hypervisor", "temporal isolation among virtual machines", "security token", "volatile", "end to end principle"], "abstract": "The lack of performance isolation in multi-tenant datacenters at appliances like middleboxes and storage servers results in volatile application performance. To insulate tenants, we propose giving them the abstraction of a dedicated virtual datacenter (VDC). VDCs encapsulate end-to-end throughput guarantees--specified in a new metric based on virtual request cost--that hold across distributed appliances and the intervening network.\n\nWe present Pulsar, a system that offers tenants their own VDCs. Pulsar comprises a logically centralized controller that uses new mechanisms to estimate tenants' demands and appliance capacities, and allocates datacenter resources based on flexible policies. These allocations are enforced at end-host hypervisors through multi-resource token buckets that ensure tenants with changing workloads cannot affect others. Pulsar's design does not require changes to applications, guest OSes, or appliances. Through a prototype deployed across 113 VMs, three appliances, and a 40 Gbps network, we show that Pulsar enforces tenants' VDCs while imposing overheads of less than 2% at the data and control plane.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "osdi", "authors": ["Sebastian Angel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angel:Sebastian", "Hitesh Ballani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ballani:Hitesh", "Thomas Karagiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karagiannis:Thomas", "Greg O'Shea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Shea:Greg", "Eno Thereska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thereska:Eno"], "pages": 16}
