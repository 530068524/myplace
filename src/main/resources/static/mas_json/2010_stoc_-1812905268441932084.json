We show that if the dimension of the tight span associated with the weight is at most 2, then this problem has a 1/12-integral optimal multiflow for every Eulerian supply graph. This result solves a weighted generalization of Karzanov's conjecture for classifying commodity graphs with finite fractionality. In addition, our proof technique proves the existence of an integral or half-integrality optimal multiflow for a large class of multiflow maximization problems, and it gives a polynomial time algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Hiroshi Hirai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirai_0001:Hiroshi"], "pages": 6}
