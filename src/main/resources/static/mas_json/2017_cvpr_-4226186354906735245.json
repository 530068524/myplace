{"title": "Factorized Variational Autoencoders for Modeling Audience Reactions to Movies.", "fields": ["data modeling", "probabilistic logic", "factorization", "raw data", "tensor"], "abstract": "Matrix and tensor factorization methods are often used for finding underlying low-dimensional patterns from noisy data. In this paper, we study non-linear tensor factorization methods based on deep variational autoencoders. Our approach is well-suited for settings where the relationship between the latent representation to be learned and the raw data representation is highly complex. We apply our approach to a large dataset of facial expressions of movie-watching audiences (over 16 million faces). Our experiments show that compared to conventional linear factorization methods, our method achieves better reconstruction of the data, and further discovers interpretable latent factors.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Disney Research", "University of Minnesota", "Disney Research", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhiwei Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Zhiwei", "Rajitha Navarathna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navarathna:Rajitha", "Peter Carr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carr_0001:Peter", "Stephan Mandt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mandt:Stephan", "Yisong Yue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yue:Yisong", "Iain A.
