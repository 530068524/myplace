The SCSG represents the hierarchical compositions of events and the temporal relations between the sub-events. The alphabets of the SCSG are atomic actions which are defined by the poses of agents and their interactions with objects in the scene. The temporal relations are used to distinguish events with similar structures, interpolate missing portions of events, and are learned from the training data. In comparison with existing methods, our paper makes the following contributions. i) We define atomic actions by a set of relations based on the fluents of agents and their interactions with objects in the scene. ii) Our algorithm handles events insertion and multi-agent events, keeps all possible interpretations of the video to preserve the ambiguities, and achieves the globally optimal parsing solution in a Bayesian framework; iii) The algorithm infers the goal of the agents and predicts their intents by a top-down process; iv) The algorithm improves the detection of atomic actions by event contexts. We show satisfactory results of event recognition and atomic action detection on the data set we captured which contains 12 event categories in both indoor and outdoor videos.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Mingtao Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Mingtao", "Yunde Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yunde", "Song-Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song=Chun"], "pages": 8}
