{"title": "Strategic Coalitions With Perfect Recall.", "fields": ["soundness", "distributed knowledge", "know how", "godel s completeness theorem", "axiom"], "abstract": "The paper proposes a bimodal logic that describes an interplay between distributed knowledge modality and coalition know-how modality. Unlike other similar systems, the one proposed here assumes perfect recall by all agents. Perfect recall is captured in the system by a single axiom. The main technical results are the soundness and the completeness theorems for the proposed logical system.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Vassar College", "Lafayette College"], "authors": ["Pavel Naumov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naumov:Pavel", "Jia Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Jia"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
