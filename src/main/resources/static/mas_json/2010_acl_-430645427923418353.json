{"title": "Contextualizing Semantic Representations Using Syntactically Enriched Vector Models.", "fields": ["ranking", "machine learning", "paraphrase", "computation", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We present a syntactically enriched vector model that supports the computation of contextualized semantic representations in a quasi compositional fashion. It employs a systematic combination of first- and second-order context vectors. We apply our model to two different tasks and show that (i) it substantially outperforms previous work on a paraphrase ranking task, and (ii) achieves promising results on a wordsense similarity task; to our knowledge, it is the first time that an unsupervised method has been applied to this task.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Stefan Thater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thater:Stefan", "Hagen F\u00fcrstenau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/F=uuml=rstenau:Hagen", "Manfred Pinkal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinkal:Manfred"], "pages": 10}
