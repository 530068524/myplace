The classifier containing pre-defined rules is processed by the router for finding the best matching rule for each incoming packet and for taking appropriate actions. Although many software-based solutions had been proposed, high search speed required for Internet backbone routers is not easy to achieve. To accelerate the packet classification, the state-of-the-art ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) is a promising solution. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-field range encoding scheme to solve the problem of storing ranges in TCAM and to decrease TCAM usage. Existing range encoding schemes are usually single-field schemes that perform range encoding processes in the range fields independently. Our performance experiments on real-life classifiers show that the proposed multi-field range encoding scheme uses less TCAM memory than the existing single field schemes. Compared with existing notable single-field encoding schemes, the proposed scheme uses 12% \u223c 33% of TCAM memory needed in DRIPE or SRGE and 56% \u223c 86% of TCAM memory needed in PPC for the classifiers of up to 10k rules.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["National Cheng Kung University", "National Cheng Kung University", "National Cheng Kung University"], "authors": ["Yeim-Kuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yeim=Kuan", "Chun-I Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chun=I", "Cheng-Chien Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Cheng=Chien"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
