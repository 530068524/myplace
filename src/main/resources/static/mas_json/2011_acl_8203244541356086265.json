{"title": "Gappy Phrasal Alignment By Agreement.", "fields": ["overfitting", "machine translation", "state space", "hidden markov model", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We propose a principled and efficient phrase-to-phrase alignment model, useful in machine translation as well as other related natural language processing problems. In a hidden semi-Markov model, word-to-phrase and phrase-to-word translations are modeled directly by the system. Agreement between two directional models encourages the selection of parsimonious phrasal alignments, avoiding the overfitting commonly encountered in unsupervised training with multi-word units. Expanding the state space to include \"gappy phrases\" (such as French ne * pas) makes the alignment space more symmetric; thus, it allows agreement between discontinuous alignments. The resulting system shows substantial improvements in both alignment quality and translation quality over word-based Hidden Markov Models, while maintaining asymptotically equivalent runtime.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Microsoft", "Google"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mohit Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Mohit", "Chris Quirk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quirk:Chris", "Robert C.
