The system is composed by a modern user interface for browsing, surfing and querying, an automatic segmentation module, to ease the initial picture extraction task, and a similarity based retrieval engine, used to provide visually assisted tagging capabilities. A relevance feedback procedure is included to further refine the results.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e0 degl ... , Modena, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... , Modena, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... , Modena, Italy"], "authors": ["Daniele Borghesani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borghesani:Daniele", "Costantino Grana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grana:Costantino", "Rita Cucchiara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cucchiara:Rita"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
