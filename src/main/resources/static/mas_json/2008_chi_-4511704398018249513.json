{"title": "It's Mine, Don't Touch!: interactions at a large multi-touch display in a city centre.", "fields": ["negotiation", "conflict management", "display size", "gesture", "performative utterance"], "abstract": "We present data from detailed observations of CityWall, a large multi-touch display installed in a central location in Helsinki, Finland. During eight days of installation, 1199 persons interacted with the system in various social configurations. Videos of these encounters were examined qualitatively as well as quantitatively based on human coding of events. The data convey phenomena that arise uniquely in public use: crowding, massively parallel interaction, teamwork, games, negotiations of transitions and handovers, conflict management, gestures and overt remarks to co-present people, and \"marking\" the display for others. We analyze how public availability is achieved through social learning and negotiation, why interaction becomes performative and, finally, how the display restructures the public space. The multi-touch feature, gesture-based interaction, and the physical display size contributed differentially to these uses. Our findings on the social organization of the use of public displays can be useful for designing such systems for urban environments.", "citation": "Citations (514)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Peter Peltonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peltonen:Peter", "Esko Kurvinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurvinen:Esko", "Antti Salovaara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salovaara:Antti", "Giulio Jacucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacucci:Giulio", "Tommi Ilmonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilmonen:Tommi", "John Evans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Evans:John", "Antti Oulasvirta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oulasvirta:Antti", "Petri Saarikko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saarikko:Petri"], "pages": 10}
