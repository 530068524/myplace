We characterize the information work practices and challenges that exist largely at the different intersections of three constructs - cloud-based services, collaborations, and digital identifiers. We also demonstrate how the misalignment of these three constructs is experienced as a \"losing battle\" that has led to miscommunication among collaborators, the abandonment of cloud-based services, and the irreparable blurring of digital identities.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Amy Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Amy", "Judith S.
