This system is based on the exchange of logical statements that describe documents, collections, access rights, keys and localization information and updates of this data. We illustrate how the model can be used in a social-network context to help users keep control on their data on the web. In particular, we show how users within very different schemes of data-distribution (centralized, dht, unstructured P2P, etc.) can still transparently collaborate while keeping a good control over their own data.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "Rutgers University", "U. of Californi ... a Cruz, CA, USA"], "authors": ["\u00c9milien Antoine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antoine:=Eacute=milien", "Alban Galland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galland:Alban", "Kristian Lyngbaek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyngbaek:Kristian", "Am\u00e9lie Marian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marian:Am=eacute=lie", "Neoklis Polyzotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polyzotis:Neoklis"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
