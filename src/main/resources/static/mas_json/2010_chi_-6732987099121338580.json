To this end we investigate the influence of two prominent VR parameters, 3d-motion and interactivity, while brain activity is measured for a mental rotation task, using functional MRI (fMRI). A mental rotation network of brain areas is identified, matching previous results. The addition of interactivity increases the activation in core areas of this network, with more profound effects in frontal and preparatory motor areas. The increases from 3d-motion are restricted to primarily visual areas. We relate these effects to emerging theories of cognition and potential applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Our results demonstrate one way to provoke increased activity in task-relevant areas, making it easier to detect and use for adaptation and development of HCI.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Ume\u00e5 University", "Ume\u00e5 University", "Ume\u00e5 University", "Ume\u00e5 University", "Ume\u00e5 University"], "authors": ["Daniel Sj\u00f6lie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sj=ouml=lie:Daniel", "Kenneth Bodin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodin:Kenneth", "Eva Elgh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elgh:Eva", "Johan Eriksson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eriksson:Johan", "Lars-Erik Janlert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Janlert:Lars=Erik", "Lars Nyberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nyberg:Lars"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
