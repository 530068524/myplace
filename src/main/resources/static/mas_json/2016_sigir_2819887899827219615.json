{"title": "Multi-Rate Deep Learning for Temporal Recommendation.", "fields": ["recommender system", "deep learning", "inference", "architecture", "free parameter"], "abstract": "Modeling temporal behavior in recommendation systems is an important and challenging problem. Its challenges come from the fact that temporal modeling increases the cost of parameter estimation and inference, while requiring large amount of data to reliably learn the model with the additional time dimensions. Therefore, it is often difficult to model temporal behavior in large-scale real-world recommendation systems. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network based architecture that models the combination of long-term static and short-term temporal user preferences to improve the recommendation performance. To train the model efficiently for large-scale applications, we propose a novel pre-train method to reduce the number of free parameters significantly. The resulted model is applied to a real-world data set from a commercial News recommendation system. We compare to a set of established baselines and the experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Columbia University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yang Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yang", "Ali Mamdouh Elkahky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkahky:Ali_Mamdouh", "Xiaodong He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaodong"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
