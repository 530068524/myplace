Recent research has produced powerful tools that can check a wide range of programs for termination. The analog for probabilistic programs, namely termination with probability one (\"almost-sure termination\"), is an equally important property for randomized algorithms and probabilistic protocols. We suggest a novel algorithm for proving almost-sure termination of probabilistic programs. Our algorithm exploits the power of state-of-the-art model checkers and termination provers for nonprobabilistic programs: it calls such tools within a refinement loop and thereby iteratively constructs a \"terminating pattern\", which is a set of terminating runs with probability one. We report on various case studies illustrating the effectiveness of our algorithm. As a further application, our algorithm can improve lower bounds on reachability probabilities.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Javier Esparza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esparza:Javier", "Andreas Gaiser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaiser:Andreas", "Stefan Kiefer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiefer:Stefan"], "pages": 16}
