{"title": "Online Graph Pruning for Pathfinding On Grid Maps.", "fields": ["jump", "grid reference", "macro", "speedup", "pathfinding"], "abstract": "Pathfinding in uniform-cost grid environments is a problem commonly found in application areas such as robotics and video games. The state-of-the-art is dominated by hierarchical pathfinding algorithms which are fast and have small memory overheads but usually return suboptimal paths. In this paper we present a novel search strategy, specific to grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead. Our algorithm can be described as a macro operator which identifies and selectively expands only certain nodes in a grid map which we call jump points. Intermediate nodes on a path connecting two jump points are never expanded. We prove that this approach always computes optimal solutions and then undertake a thorough empirical analysis, comparing our method with related works from the literature. We find that searching with jump points can speed up A* by an order of magnitude and more and report significant improvement over the current state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (126)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Daniel Damir Harabor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harabor:Daniel_Damir", "Alban Grastien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grastien:Alban"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
