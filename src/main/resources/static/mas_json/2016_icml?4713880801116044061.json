In this paper, we propose to compute topographical features of high-dimensional categorical data. We propose an efficient algorithm to extract modes of the underlying distribution and their attractive basins. These topographical features provide a geometric view of the data and can be applied to visualization and clustering of real world challenging datasets. Experiments show that our principled method outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods while also admits an embarrassingly parallel property.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Queens College", "University of Sussex"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Chao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chao", "Novi Quadrianto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quadrianto:Novi"], "pages": 9}
