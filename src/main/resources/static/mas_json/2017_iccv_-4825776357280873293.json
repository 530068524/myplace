{"title": "Temporal Tessellation: A Unified Approach for Video Analysis.", "fields": ["tessellation", "closed captioning", "benchmark", "clips", "computer vision", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "We present a general approach to video understanding, inspired by semantic transfer techniques that have been successfully used for 2D image analysis. Our method considers a video to be a 1D sequence of clips, each one associated with its own semantics. The nature of these semantics \u2013 natural language captions or other labels \u2013 depends on the task at hand. A test video is processed by forming correspondences between its clips and the clips of reference videos with known semantics, following which, reference semantics can be transferred to the test video. We describe two matching methods, both designed to ensure that (a) reference clips appear similar to test clips and (b), taken together, the semantics of the selected reference clips is consistent and maintains temporal coherence. We use our method for video captioning on the LSMDC\u201916 benchmark, video summarization on the SumMe and TV-Sum benchmarks, Temporal Action Detection on the Thumos2014 benchmark, and sound prediction on the Greatest Hits benchmark. Our method not only surpasses the state of the art, in four out of five benchmarks, but importantly, it is the only single method we know of that was successfully applied to such a diverse range of tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Open University of Israel", "Open University of Israel", "Tel Aviv University", "Open University of Israel", "Open University of Israel", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Dotan Kaufman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufman:Dotan", "Gil Levi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levi:Gil", "Tal Hassner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassner:Tal", "Lior Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Lior"], "pages": 11}
