We present the abstract concept of a transparency overlay, which can be used in conjunction with any system to give it provable transparency guarantees, and then apply the overlay to two settings: Certificate Transparency and Bitcoin. In the latter setting, we show that the usage of our transparency overlay eliminates the need to engage in mining and allows users to store a single small value rather than the entire blockchain. Our transparency overlay is generically constructed from a signature scheme and a new primitive we call a dynamic list commitment, which in practice can be instantiated using a collision-resistant hash function.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University College London"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Melissa Chase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chase:Melissa", "Sarah Meiklejohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meiklejohn:Sarah"], "pages": 12}
