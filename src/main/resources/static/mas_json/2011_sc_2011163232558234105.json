We here report unprecedented simulations on the electron states of silicon nanowires with up to 107,292 atoms carried out during the initial performance evaluation phase of the K computer being developed at RIKEN.   The RSDFT code has been parallelized and optimized so as to make effective use of the various capabilities of the K computer. Simulation results for the self-consistent electron states of a silicon nanowire with 10,000 atoms were obtained in a run lasting about 24 hours and using 6,144 cores of the K computer. A 3.08 peta-flops sustained performance was measured for one iteration of the SCF calculation in a 107,292-atom Si nanowire calculation using 442,368 cores, which is 43.63% of the peak performance of 7.07 peta-flops.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tokyo", "Development Gro ...
