{"title": "On the steady-state of cache networks.", "fields": ["cache invalidation", "bus sniffing", "cache pollution", "cache coloring", "cache stampede"], "abstract": "Over the past few years Content-Centric Networking, a networking model in which host-to-content communication protocols are introduced, has been gaining much attention. A central component of such an architecture is a large-scale interconnected caching system. To date, the way these Cache Networks operate and perform is still poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that certain cache networks are non-ergodic in that their steady-state characterization depends on the initial state of the system. We then establish several important properties of cache networks, in the form of three independently-sufficient conditions for a cache network to comprise a single ergodic component. Each property targets a different aspect of the system - topology, admission control and cache replacement policies. Perhaps most importantly we demonstrate that cache replacement can be grouped into equivalence classes, such that the ergodicity (or lack-thereof) of one policy implies the same property holds for all policies in the class.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Dept. of Comput ...
