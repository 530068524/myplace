Due to the heterogeneity of machine configurations, datacenter jobs frequently specify  placement constraints , restricting them to run on a particular class of machines meeting specific hardware/software requirements. In addition, jobs have diverse demands across  multiple resource types , and may saturate any of the CPU, memory, or storage resources. Despite the rich body of recent work on datacenter scheduling, it remains unclear how multi-resource fair sharing is defined and achieved for jobs with placement constraints. In this paper, we propose a new sharing policy called Task Share Fairness (TSF). With TSF, jobs are better off sharing the datacenter, and are better off reporting demands and constraints truthfully. We have prototyped TSF on Apache Mesos and confirmed its service guarantees in a 50-node EC2 cluster. Trace-driven simulations have further revealed that TSF speeds up 60% of tasks over existing fair schedulers.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0030:Wei", "Baochun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baochun", "Ben Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Ben", "Jun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0017:Jun"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
