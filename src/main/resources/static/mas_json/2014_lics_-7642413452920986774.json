Consider the class of Boolean decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time in the new model by machines with no machine constants. How does this class depend on  B ? We prove that it is always contained in the class obtained for  B  = {+, -, \u00d7}. Moreover, if  B  is a set of continuous semialgebraic functions containing + and -, and such that arbitrarily small numbers can be computed using  B , then we have the following dichotomy: either our class is P or it coincides with the class obtained for  B  = {+, -, \u00d7}.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "authors": ["Marcello Mamino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mamino:Marcello"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
