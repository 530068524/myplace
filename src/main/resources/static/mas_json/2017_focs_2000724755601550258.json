This approach is, essentially, equivalent to the well-known feasible interpolation method, but is applicable to CNF formulas that do not seem suitable for interpolation. Specifically, we prove exponential lower bounds for random k-CNFs, where k is the logarithm of the number of variables, and for the Weak Bit Pigeon Hole Principle. Furthermore, we prove a monotone variant of a hypothesis of Feige [12]. We give a superpolynomial lower bound on monotone real circuits that approximately decide the satisfiability of k-CNFs, where k = \u03c9(1). For k \u2248 logn, the lower bound is exponential.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"], "authors": ["Pavel Hrubes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hrubes:Pavel", "Pavel Pudl\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pudl=aacute=k:Pavel"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
