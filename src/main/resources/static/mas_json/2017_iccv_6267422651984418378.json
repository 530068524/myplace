{"title": "SSD-6D: Making RGB-Based 3D Detection and 6D Pose Estimation Great Again.", "fields": ["feature extraction", "pattern recognition", "pose", "computer vision", "rgb color model", "solid modeling", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "We present a novel method for detecting 3D model instances and estimating their 6D poses from RGB data in a single shot. To this end, we extend the popular SSD paradigm to cover the full 6D pose space and train on synthetic model data only. Our approach competes or surpasses current state-of-the-art methods that leverage RGBD data on multiple challenging datasets. Furthermore, our method produces these results at around 10Hz, which is many times faster than the related methods. For the sake of reproducibility, we make our trained networks and detection code publicly available.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Siemens", "Johns Hopkins University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Wadim Kehl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kehl:Wadim", "Fabian Manhardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manhardt:Fabian", "Federico Tombari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tombari:Federico", "Slobodan Ilic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilic:Slobodan", "Nassir Navab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navab:Nassir"], "pages": 9}
