In this paper, we address this task by proposing a joint inference approach which well incorporates label correlations among the instances. Specifically, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed to achieve global optimization with various kinds of intra-task and extra-task constraints. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ILP-based approach to interactive gender inference.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Zhejiang Gongshang University"], "authors": ["Shoushan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shoushan", "Jingjing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingjing", "Guodong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guodong", "Hanxiao Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Hanxiao"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
