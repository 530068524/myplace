If the subdomains are not homogeneous, partition testing strategies, such as branch or statement testing, do neither perform significantly better than random input generation nor do they inspire confidence when a test suite succeeds. Yet, measuring the adequacy of test suites in terms of code coverage is still considered a common practice. The main target of our research is to develop strategies for the automatic evolution of a test suite that does inspire confidence. When the program is changed, test cases shall be augmented that witness changed output for the same input (test suite augmentation). If two test cases witness the same partition, one is to be discarded (test suite reduction).", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Marcel B\u00f6hme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hme:Marcel"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
