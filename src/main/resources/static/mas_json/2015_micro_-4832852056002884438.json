Within this shifting context,  event-driven programming  is emerging as a crucial programming model to achieve scalability. In this paper, we study the microarchitectural implications of server-side scripting, JavaScript in particular, from a unique event-driven programming model perspective. Using the  Node.js  framework, we come to several critical microarchitectural conclusions. First, unlike traditional server-workloads such as CloudSuite and BigDataBench that are based on the conventional thread-based execution model, event-driven applications are heavily single-threaded, and as such they require significant single-thread performance. Second, the single-thread performance is severely limited by the front-end inefficiencies of today's server processor microarchitecture, ultimately leading to overall execution inefficiencies. The front-end inefficiencies stem from the unique combination of limited intra-event code reuse and large inter-event reuse distance. Third, through a deep understanding of event-specific characteristics, architects can mitigate the front-end inefficiencies of the managed-language-based event-driven execution via a combination of instruction cache insertion policy and prefetcher.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Yuhao Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yuhao", "Daniel Richins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Richins:Daniel", "Matthew Halpern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halpern:Matthew", "Vijay Janapa Reddi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reddi:Vijay_Janapa"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
