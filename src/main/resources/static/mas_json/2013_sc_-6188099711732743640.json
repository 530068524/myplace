{"title": "An early performance evaluation of many integrated core architecture based SGI rackable computing system.", "fields": ["intel hub architecture", "coprocessor", "single chip cloud computer", "hyper threading", "xeon phi"], "abstract": "Intel recently introduced the Xeon Phi coprocessor based on the Many Integrated Core architecture featuring 60 cores with a peak performance of 1.0 Tflop/s. NASA has deployed a 128-node SGI Rackable system where each node has two Intel Xeon E2670 8-core Sandy Bridge processors along with two Xeon Phi 5110P coprocessors. We have conducted an early performance evaluation of the Xeon Phi. We used microbenchmarks to measure the latency and bandwidth of memory and interconnect, I/O rates, and the performance of OpenMP directives and MPI functions. We also used OpenMP and MPI versions of the NAS Parallel Benchmarks along with two production CFD applications to test four programming modes: offload, processor native, coprocessor native and symmetric (processor plus coprocessor). In this paper we present preliminary results based on our performance evaluation of various aspects of a Phi-based system.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center", "Computer Sciences Corporation", "SGI Fremont, CA"], "authors": ["Subhash Saini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saini:Subhash", "Haoqiang Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Haoqiang", "Dennis C.
