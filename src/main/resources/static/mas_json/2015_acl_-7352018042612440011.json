{"title": "Co-training for Semi-supervised Sentiment Classification Based on Dual-view Bags-of-words Representation.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "bootstrapping", "pattern recognition", "negation", "co training"], "abstract": "A review text is normally represented as a bag-of-words (BOW) in sentiment classification. Such a simplified BOW model has fundamental deficiencies in modeling some complex linguistic phenomena such as negation. In this work, we propose a dual-view co-training algorithm based on dual-view BOW representation for semisupervised sentiment classification. In dual-view BOW, we automatically construct antonymous reviews and model a review text by a pair of bags-of-words with opposite views. We make use of the original and antonymous views in pairs, in the training, bootstrapping and testing process, all based on a joint observation of two views. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our approach, in meeting the two co-training requirements, addressing the negation problem, and enhancing the semi-supervised sentiment classification efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nanjing University of Science and Technology", "Nanjing University", "Florida International University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Rui Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Rui", "Cheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Cheng", "Xin-Yu Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Xin=Yu", "Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Tao"], "pages": 10}
