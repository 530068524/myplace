{"title": "A Transition-Based Parser for 2-Planar Dependency Structures.", "fields": ["parser combinator", "planar", "top down parsing", "planar graph", "dependency grammar"], "abstract": "Finding a class of structures that is rich enough for adequate linguistic representation yet restricted enough for efficient computational processing is an important problem for dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a transition system for 2-planar dependency trees -- trees that can be decomposed into at most two planar graphs -- and show that it can be used to implement a classifier-based parser that runs in linear time and outperforms a state-of-the-art transition-based parser on four data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task. In addition, we present an efficient method for determining whether an arbitrary tree is 2-planar and show that 99% or more of the trees in existing treebanks are 2-planar.", "citation": "Citations (39)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Universidade da Coru\u00f1a, Spain"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Carlos G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=oacute=mez=Rodr=iacute=guez:Carlos", "Joakim Nivre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nivre:Joakim"], "pages": 10}
