To resist them simultaneously, a novel robust hashing method is proposed by combining the strength of music beat segmentation and chroma-based music feature. These two measures are aimed at solving the problem of desynchronization and frequency shifting respectively. Moreover, two layers of scrambling are performed to ensure the security. Experiments exhibit remarkable robustness against various attacks including pitch scaling@20%, time-scale modification@40%, and jittering@1/10 etc.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Wei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0012:Wei", "Zhurong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhurong", "Bilei Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Bilei", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
