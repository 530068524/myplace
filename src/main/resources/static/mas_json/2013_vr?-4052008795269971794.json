We propose a soft social-touchable interface called \u201cEmoballoon\u201d that can recognize the types of social touch interactions. The proposed interface consists of a balloon and some sensors including a barometric pressure sensor inside of a balloon, and has a soft surface and ability to detect the force of the touch input. We construct the prototype of Emoballoon using a simple configuration based on the features of a balloon, and evaluate the implemented prototype. The evaluation indicates that our implementation can distinguish seven types of touch interactions with 83.5% accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Kosuke Nakajima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakajima:Kosuke", "Yuichi Itoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Itoh:Yuichi", "Yusuke Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi:Yusuke", "Kazuaki Ikeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikeda:Kazuaki", "Kazuyuki Fujita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujita:Kazuyuki", "Takao Onoye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onoye:Takao"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
