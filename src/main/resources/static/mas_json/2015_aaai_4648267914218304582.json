{"title": "Budgeted Prediction with Expert Advice.", "fields": ["bounded function", "machine learning", "upper and lower bounds", "regret", "total cost"], "abstract": "We consider a budgeted variant of the problem of learning from expert advice with N experts. Each queried expert incurs a cost and there is a given budget B on the total cost of experts that can be queried in any prediction round. We provide an online learning algorithm for this setting with regret after T prediction rounds bounded by O(\u221aC/B log(N)T, where C is the total cost of all experts. We complement this upper bound with a nearly matching lower bound \u03a9 (\u221aC/B T) on the regret of any algorithm for this problem. We also provide experimental validation of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "Yahoo!", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Kareem Amin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amin:Kareem", "Satyen Kale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kale:Satyen", "Gerald Tesauro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tesauro:Gerald", "Deepak S.
