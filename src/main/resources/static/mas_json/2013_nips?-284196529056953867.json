In addition to the non-convexity shared with other matrix factorization schemes, our problem is further complicated by a combinatorial constraint set of size 2m\u00b7r, where m is the dimension of the data points and r the rank of the factorization. Despite apparent intractability, we provide \u2014 in the line of recent work on non-negative matrix factorization by Arora et al. (2012)\u2014 an algorithm that provably recovers the underlying factorization in the exact case with O(mr2r + mnr + r2n) operations for n datapoints. To obtain this result, we use theory around the Littlewood-Offord lemma from combinatorics.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "authors": ["Martin Slawski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slawski:Martin", "Matthias Hein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hein_0001:Matthias", "Pavlo Lutsik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutsik:Pavlo"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
