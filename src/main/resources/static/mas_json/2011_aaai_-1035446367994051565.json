{"title": "Dominant-Strategy Auction Design for Agents with Uncertain, Private Values.", "fields": ["strategic dominance", "machine learning", "revelation principle", "welfare economics", "common value auction"], "abstract": "We study the problem of designing auctions for agents who incur a cost if they choose to learn about their own preferences. We reformulate the revelation principle for use with such deliberative agents. Then we characterize the set of single-good auctions giving rise to dominant strategies for deliberative agents whose values are independent and private. Interestingly, this set of dominant-strategy mechanisms is exactly the set of sequential posted-price auctions, a class of mechanisms that has received much recent attention.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["David Robert Martin Thompson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thompson:David_Robert_Martin", "Kevin Leyton-Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leyton=Brown:Kevin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
