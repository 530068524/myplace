{"title": "Fully Secure Functional Encryption with General Relations from the Decisional Linear Assumption.", "fields": ["deterministic encryption", "disk encryption theory", "plaintext aware encryption", "multiple encryption", "functional encryption"], "abstract": "This paper presents a fully secure functional encryption scheme for a wide class of relations, that are specified by nonmonotone access structures combined with inner-product relations. The security is proven under a well-established assumption, the decisional linear (DLIN) assumption, in the standard model. The proposed functional encryption scheme covers, as special cases, (1) key-policy and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption with non-monotone access structures, and (2) (hierarchical) predicate encryption with inner-product relations and functional encryption with non-zero inner-product relations.", "citation": "Citations (515)", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Mitsubishi Electric"], "authors": ["Tatsuaki Okamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okamoto:Tatsuaki", "Katsuyuki Takashima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takashima:Katsuyuki"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2010", "pages": 18}
