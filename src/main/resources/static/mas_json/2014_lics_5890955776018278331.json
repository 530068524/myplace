In this paper, we introduce an extension of linear time logic including past (LTL) with new operators that impose constraints on the accumulated weight along path fragments. The fragments are characterized by regular conditions formalized by deterministic finite automata (monitor DFA). This new logic covers properties expressible by several recently proposed formalisms. We study the model-checking problem for weighted transition systems, Markov chains and Markov decision processes with rational weights. While the general problem is undecidable, we provide algorithms and sharp complexity bounds for several sublogics that arise by restricting the monitoring DFA.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Christel Baier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baier:Christel", "Joachim Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein_0001:Joachim", "Sascha Kl\u00fcppelholz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kl=uuml=ppelholz:Sascha", "Sascha Wunderlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wunderlich:Sascha"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
