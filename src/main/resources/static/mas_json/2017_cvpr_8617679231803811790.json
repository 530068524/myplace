{"title": "Efficient Diffusion on Region Manifolds: Recovering Small Objects with Compact CNN Representations.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "solver", "nearest neighbor search", "query expansion", "visual word"], "abstract": "Query expansion is a popular method to improve the quality of image retrieval with both conventional and CNN representations. It has been so far limited to global image similarity. This work focuses on diffusion, a mechanism that captures the image manifold in the feature space. An efficient off-line stage allows optional reduction in the number of stored regions. In the on-line stage, the proposed handling of unseen queries in the indexing stage removes additional computation to adjust the precomputed data. We perform diffusion through a sparse linear system solver, yielding practical query times well below one second. Experimentally, we observe a significant boost in performance of image retrieval with compact CNN descriptors on standard benchmarks, especially when the query object covers only a small part of the image. Small objects have been a common failure case of CNN-based retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ahmet Iscen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iscen:Ahmet", "Giorgos Tolias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tolias:Giorgos", "Yannis S.
