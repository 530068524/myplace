{"title": "Beta Probabilistic Databases: A Scalable Approach to Belief Updating and Parameter Learning.", "fields": ["bayesian inference", "probabilistic logic", "scalability", "independence", "tuple"], "abstract": "Tuple-independent probabilistic databases (TI-PDBs) handle uncertainty by annotating each tuple with a probability parameter; when the user submits a query, the database derives the marginal probabilities of each output-tuple, assuming input-tuples are statistically independent. While query processing in TI-PDBs has been studied extensively, limited research has been dedicated to the problems of  updating or deriving the parameters from observations of query results . Addressing this problem is the main focus of this paper. We introduce  Beta Probabilistic Databases  (B-PDBs), a generalization of TI-PDBs designed to support both (i)  belief updating  and (ii)  parameter learning  in a principled and scalable way. The key idea of B-PDBs is to treat each parameter as a latent, Beta-distributed random variable. We show how this simple expedient enables both belief updating and parameter learning in a principled way, without imposing any burden on regular query processing. We use this model to provide the following key contributions: (i) we show how to scalably compute the posterior densities of the parameters given new evidence; (ii) we study the complexity of performing Bayesian belief updates, devising efficient algorithms for tractable classes of queries; (iii) we propose a soft-EM algorithm for computing maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters; (iv) we show how to embed the proposed algorithms into a standard relational engine; (v) we support our conclusions with extensive experimental results.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "Carnegie Mellon University", "HPE Vertica, Ca ... bridge, MA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Niccol\u00f2 Meneghetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meneghetti:Niccol=ograve=", "Oliver Kennedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kennedy:Oliver", "Wolfgang Gatterbauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gatterbauer:Wolfgang"], "pages": 14}
