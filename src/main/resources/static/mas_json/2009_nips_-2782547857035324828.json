{"title": "Free energy score space.", "fields": ["test data generation", "generative topographic map", "generative grammar", "discriminative model", "generative model"], "abstract": "A score function induced by a generative model of the data can provide a feature vector of a fixed dimension for each data sample. Data samples themselves may be of differing lengths (e.g., speech segments, or other sequence data), but as a score function is based on the properties of the data generation process, it produces a fixed-length vector in a highly informative space, typically referred to as a \"score space\". Discriminative classifiers have been shown to achieve higher performance in appropriately chosen score spaces than is achievable by either the corresponding generative likelihood-based classifiers, or the discriminative classifiers using standard feature extractors. In this paper, we present a novel score space that exploits the free energy associated with a generative model. The resulting free energy score space (FESS) takes into account latent structure of the data at various levels, and can be trivially shown to lead to classification performance that at least matches the performance of the free energy classifier based on the same generative model, and the same factorization of the posterior. We also show that in several typical vision and computational biology applications the classifiers optimized in FESS outperform the corresponding pure generative approaches, as well as a number of previous approaches to combining discriminating and generative models.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Verona", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "University of Verona", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alessandro Perina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perina:Alessandro", "Marco Cristani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cristani:Marco", "Umberto Castellani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castellani:Umberto", "Vittorio Murino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murino:Vittorio", "Nebojsa Jojic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jojic:Nebojsa"], "pages": 9}
