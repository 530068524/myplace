In face-to-face support groups, health professionals facilitate peer-patients exchanging experience while adding their clinical expertise when necessary. However, the large scale of online health communities makes it challenging for such health professional moderators' involvement to happen. To address this challenge of delivering clinical expertise to where patients need them, we explore the idea of semi-automatically providing clinical expertise in online health communities. We interviewed 14 clinicians showing them example peer-patient conversation threads. From the interviews, we examined the ideal practice of clinicians providing expertise to patients. The clinicians continuously assessed when peer-patients were providing appropriate support, what kinds of clinical help they could give online, and when to defer to patients' healthcare providers. The findings inform requirements for building a semi-automated system delivering clinical expertise in online health communities.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jina Huh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huh:Jina", "Wanda Pratt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pratt:Wanda"], "pages": 10}
