{"title": "Neural Dynamic Programming for Musical Self Similarity.", "fields": ["edit distance", "recursion", "self similarity", "scaling", "synthetic data"], "abstract": "We present a neural sequence model designed specifically for symbolic music. The model is based on a learned edit distance mechanism which generalises a classic recursion from computer science, leading to a neural dynamic program. Repeated motifs are detected by learning the transformations between them. We represent the arising computational dependencies using a novel data structure, the edit tree; this perspective suggests natural approximations which afford the scaling up of our otherwise cubic time algorithm. We demonstrate our model on real and synthetic data; in all cases it out-performs a strong stacked long short-term memory benchmark.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Christian J.
