While existing software graph processing frameworks improve programmability of graph analytics, underlying general purpose processors still limit the performance and energy efficiency of graph analytics. We architect a domain-specific accelerator, Graphicionado, for high-performance, energy-efficient processing of graph analytics workloads. For efficient graph analytics processing, Graphicionado exploits not only data structure-centric datapath specialization, but also memory subsystem specialization, all the while taking advantage of the parallelism inherent in this domain. Graphicionado augments the vertex programming paradigm, allowing different graph analytics applications to be mapped to the same accelerator framework, while maintaining flexibility through a small set of reconfigurable blocks. This paper describes Graphicionado pipeline design choices in detail and gives insights on how Graphicionado combats application execution inefficiencies on general-purpose CPUs. Our results show that Graphicionado achieves a 1.76 \u2212 6.54x speedup while consuming 50 \u2212 100x less energy compared to a state-of-the-art software graph analytics processing framework executing 32 threads on a 16-core Haswell Xeon processor.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of California, Berkeley", "Intel", "Intel", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Tae Jun Ham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ham:Tae_Jun", "Lisa Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Lisa", "Narayanan Sundaram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundaram:Narayanan", "Nadathur Satish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satish:Nadathur", "Margaret Martonosi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martonosi:Margaret"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
