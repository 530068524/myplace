Despite their success, backdoors have not been used for planning, a central problem in AI that has a high computational complexity. In this work, we introduce two notions of backdoors building upon the causal graph. We analyze the complexity of finding a small backdoor (detection) and using the backdoor to solve the problem (evaluation) in the light of planning with (un)bounded plan length/domain of the variables. For each setting we present either an fpt-result or rule out the existence thereof by showing parameterized intractability. In three cases we achieve the most desirable outcome: detection and evaluation are fpt.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Masaryk University", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Martin Kronegger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kronegger:Martin", "Sebastian Ordyniak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ordyniak:Sebastian", "Andreas Pfandler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfandler:Andreas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 8}
