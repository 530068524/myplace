{"title": "Deep Value Networks Learn to Evaluate and Iteratively Refine Structured Outputs.", "fields": ["scalar", "ground truth", "value network", "f1 score", "gradient descent"], "abstract": "We approach structured output prediction by optimizing a deep value network (DVN) to precisely estimate the task loss on different output configurations for a given input. Once the model is trained, we perform inference by gradient descent on the continuous relaxations of the output variables to find outputs with promising scores from the value network. When applied to image segmentation, the value network takes an image and a segmentation mask as inputs and predicts a scalar estimating the intersection over union between the input and ground truth masks. For multi-label classification, the DVN's objective is to correctly predict the F1 score for any potential label configuration. The DVN framework achieves the state-of-the-art results on multi-label prediction and image segmentation benchmarks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "University of Toronto", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Michael Gygli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gygli:Michael", "Mohammad Norouzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norouzi_0002:Mohammad", "Anelia Angelova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angelova:Anelia"], "pages": 11}
