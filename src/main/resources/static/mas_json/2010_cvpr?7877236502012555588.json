Our goal is to construct a gaze estimator only using eye images captured from a person watching a video clip. The key is treating saliency maps of the video frames as probability distributions of gaze points. To efficiently identify gaze points from saliency maps, we aggregate saliency maps based on the similarity of eye appearances. We establish mapping between eye images to gaze points by Gaussian process regression. The experimental result shows that the proposed method works well with different people and video clips and achieves 6 degrees of accuracy, which is useful for estimating a person's attention on monitors.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Microsoft", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yusuke Sugano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugano:Yusuke", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki", "Yoichi Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Yoichi"], "pages": 8}
