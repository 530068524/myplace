{"title": "CodeHint: dynamic and interactive synthesis of code snippets.", "fields": ["code generation", "correctness", "programmer", "program synthesis", "redundant code"], "abstract": "There are many tools that help programmers find code fragments, but most are inexpressive and rely on static information. We present a new technique for synthesizing code that is dynamic (giving accurate results and allowing programmers to reason about concrete executions), easy-to-use (supporting a wide range of correctness specifications), and interactive (allowing users to refine the candidate code snippets). Our implementation, which we call CodeHint, generates and evaluates code at runtime and hence can synthesize real-world Java code that involves I/O, reflection, native calls, and other advanced language features. We have evaluated CodeHint in two user studies and show that its algorithms are efficient and that it improves programmer productivity by more than a factor of two.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Joel Galenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galenson:Joel", "Philip Reames.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reames:Philip", "Rastislav Bod\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bod=iacute=k:Rastislav", "Bj\u00f6rn Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartmann:Bj=ouml=rn", "Koushik Sen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sen:Koushik"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
