{"title": "Specification engineering and modular verification using a web-integrated verifying compiler.", "fields": ["software development", "compiler", "functional verification", "verification", "software verification"], "abstract": "This demonstration will present the RESOLVE web-integrated environment, which has been especially built to capture component relationships and allow construction and composition of verified generic components. The environment facilitates team-based software development and has been used in undergraduate CS education at multiple institutions. The environment makes it easy to simulate \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios, including the impact of alternative specification styles on verification, and has spawned much research and experimentation. The demonstration will illustrate the issues in generic software verification and the role of higher-order assertions. It will show how logical errors are pinpointed when verification fails.
