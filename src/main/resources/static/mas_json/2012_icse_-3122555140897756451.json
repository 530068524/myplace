WorkItemExplorer enables developers and managers to investigate activity and correlations in their task management system by making data exploration flexible and interactive, and by utilizing multiple coordinated views. Our preliminary evaluation shows that WorkItemExplorer is able to answer questions that developers ask, while also enabling them to gain new insights through the free exploration of data.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Christoph Treude.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Treude:Christoph", "Patrick Gorman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorman:Patrick", "Lars Grammel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grammel:Lars", "Margaret-Anne D.
