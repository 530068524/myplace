Using our system, two or more users with a common information need search together, simultaneously. The collaborative system provides tools, user interfaces and, most importantly, algorithmically-mediated retrieval to focus, enhance and augment the team's search and communication activities. Collaborative search outperformed  post hoc  merging of similarly instrumented single user runs. Algorithmic mediation improved both collaborative search (allowing a team of searchers to find relevant information more efficiently and effectively), and exploratory search (allowing the searchers to find relevant information that cannot be found while working individually).", "citation": "Citations (210)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "FX Palo Alto La ... o Alto, CA, USA", "FX Palo Alto La ... o Alto, CA, USA", "FX Palo Alto La ... o Alto, CA, USA", "FX Palo Alto La ... o Alto, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Jeremy Pickens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pickens:Jeremy", "Gene Golovchinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovchinsky:Gene", "Chirag Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Chirag", "Pernilla Qvarfordt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qvarfordt:Pernilla", "Maribeth Back.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Back:Maribeth"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
