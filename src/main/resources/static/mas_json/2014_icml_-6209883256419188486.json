In general reading the value of a variable is done at the expense of some cost (computational or possibly a fee to pay the corresponding experiment). The goal is to design a strategy for evaluating the function incurring little cost (in the worst case or in expectation according to a prior distribution on the possible variables' assignments).\n\nOur algorithm builds a strategy (decision tree) which attains a logarithmic approximation simultaneously for the expected and worst cost spent. This is best possible since, under standard complexity assumption, no algorithm can guarantee o(log n) approximation.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Salerno", "Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro", "Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ferdinando Cicalese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cicalese:Ferdinando", "Eduardo Sany Laber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laber:Eduardo_Sany", "Aline Medeiros Saettler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saettler:Aline_Medeiros"], "pages": 9}
