{"title": "A Deep Architecture for Semantic Matching with Multiple Positional Sentence Representations.", "fields": ["semantic matching", "pooling", "perceptron", "sentence completion tests", "sentence"], "abstract": "Matching natural language sentences is central for many applications such as information retrieval and question answering. Existing deep models rely on a single sentence representation or multiple granularity representations for matching. However, such methods cannot well capture the contextualized local information in the matching process. To tackle this problem, we present a new deep architecture to match two sentences with multiple positional sentence representations. Specifically, each positional sentence representation is a sentence representation at this position, generated by a bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM). The matching score is finally produced by aggregating interactions between these different positional sentence representations, through k-Max pooling and a multi-layer perceptron. Our model has several advantages: (1) By using Bi-LSTM, rich context of the whole sentence is leveraged to capture the contextualized local information in each positional sentence representation; (2) By matching with multiple positional sentence representations, it is flexible to aggregate different important contextualized local information in a sentence to support the matching; (3) Experiments on different tasks such as question answering and sentence completion demonstrate the superiority of our model.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Shengxian Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Shengxian", "Yanyan Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Yanyan", "Jiafeng Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jiafeng", "Jun Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Jun", "Liang Pang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pang:Liang", "Xueqi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xueqi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
