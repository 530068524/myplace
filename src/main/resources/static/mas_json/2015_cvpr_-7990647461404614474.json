{"title": "Towards Open World Recognition.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "thresholding", "feature vector", "monotonic function", "downtime"], "abstract": "With the of advent rich classification models and high computational power visual recognition systems have found many operational applications. Recognition in the real world poses multiple challenges that are not apparent in controlled lab environments. The datasets are dynamic and novel categories must be continuously detected and then added. At prediction time, a trained system has to deal with myriad unseen categories. Operational systems require minimal downtime, even to learn. To handle these operational issues, we present the problem of Open World Recognition and formally define it. We prove that thresholding sums of monotonically decreasing functions of distances in linearly transformed feature space can balance \u201copen space risk\u201d and empirical risk. Our theory extends existing algorithms for open world recognition. We present a protocol for evaluation of open world recognition systems. We present the Nearest Non-Outlier (NNO) algorithm that evolves model efficiently, adding object categories incrementally while detecting outliers and managing open space risk. We perform experiments on the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M+ images to validate the effectiveness of our method on large scale visual recognition tasks. NNO consistently yields superior results on open world recognition.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Colorado Colorado Springs", "University of Colorado Colorado Springs"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Abhijit Bendale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bendale:Abhijit", "Terrance E.
