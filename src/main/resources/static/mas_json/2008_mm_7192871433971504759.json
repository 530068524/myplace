We propose an environment for the design, the parameterization and the control in real-time of mass-spring systems. Control is based on live image analysis, whether video capture or real-time 3D image synthesis. Efficient and fluid rendering is ensured by parallel computing on the graphic processor. Several setups are presented to illustrate the wide variety of designs that can be implemented through this platform.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Christian Jacquemin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacquemin:Christian"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
