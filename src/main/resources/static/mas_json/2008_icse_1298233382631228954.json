We built a toolset named SpyWare which, using a monitoring plug-in for integrated development environments (IDEs), tracks the changes that a developer performs on a program  as they happen . SpyWare stores these first-class changes in a change repository and offers a plethora of productivity-enhancing IDE extensions to exploit the recorded information.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Romain Robbes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robbes:Romain", "Michele Lanza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lanza:Michele"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
