{"title": "Dynamic and Non-uniform Pricing Strategies for Revenue Maximization.", "fields": ["subadditivity", "revenue", "maximization", "pricing strategies", "work in process", "multiplicative function"], "abstract": "We study the Item Pricing problem for revenue maximization in the limited supply setting, where a single seller with n distinct items caters to m buyers with unknown subadditive valuation functions who arrive in a sequence. The seller sets the prices on individual items, and each buyer buys a subset of yet unsold items that maximizes her utility. The goal is to design pricing strategies that guarantee an expected revenue that is within a small factor of the optimal social welfare -- an upper bound on the maximum revenue possible. We design poly-logarithmic approximation algorithms for revenue maximization in this setting, and in process highlight a strong separation between the power of some natural classes of pricing strategies.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Tanmoy Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty_0001:Tanmoy", "Zhiyi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0002:Zhiyi", "Sanjeev Khanna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khanna:Sanjeev"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
