While most embedding algorithms binarize both query and database signatures, it has been noted that this is not strictly a requirement. Indeed, asymmetric schemes that binarize the database signatures but not the query still enjoy the same two benefits but may provide superior accuracy. In this work, we propose two general asymmetric distances that are applicable to a wide variety of embedding techniques including locality sensitive hashing (LSH), locality sensitive binary codes (LSBC), spectral hashing (SH), PCA embedding (PCAE), PCAE with random rotations (PCAE-RR), and PCAE with iterative quantization (PCAE-ITQ). We experiment on four public benchmarks containing up to 1M images and show that the proposed asymmetric distances consistently lead to large improvements over the symmetric Hamming distance for all binary embedding techniques.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Xerox", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Xerox"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Albert Gordo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gordo:Albert", "Florent Perronnin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perronnin:Florent"], "pages": 8}
