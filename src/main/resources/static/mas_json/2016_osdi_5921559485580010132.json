{"title": "Simplifying Datacenter Network Debugging with PathDump.", "fields": ["network packet", "snapshot", "forwarding plane", "edge device", "network element"], "abstract": "Datacenter networks continue to grow complex due to larger scales, higher speeds and higher link utilization. Existing tools to manage and debug these networks are even more complex, requiring in-network techniques like collecting per-packet per-switch logs, dynamic switch rule updates, periodically collecting data plane snapshots, packet mirroring, packet sampling, traffic replay, etc.\n\nThis paper calls for a radically different approach to network management and debugging: in contrast to implementing the functionality entirely in-network, we should carefully partition the debugging tasks between the edge devices and the network elements. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of PathDump, a minimalistic tool that utilizes resources at edge devices for network debugging. PathDump currently runs over a real network comprising only of commodity hardware, and yet, can support a surprisingly large class of network debugging problems. Evaluation results show that Path-Dump requires minimal switch and edge resources, while enabling network debugging at fine-grained time scales.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Cornell University", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Praveen Tammana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tammana:Praveen", "Rachit Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal_0001:Rachit", "Myungjin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Myungjin"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2016", "pages": 16}
