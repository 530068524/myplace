{"title": "Reality-based interaction: a framework for post-WIMP interfaces.", "fields": ["post wimp", "ubiquitous computing", "virtual reality", "multimedia", "interaction styles"], "abstract": "We are in the midst of an explosion of emerging human-computer interaction techniques that redefine our understanding of both computers and interaction. We propose the notion of  Reality-Based Interaction  (RBI) as a unifying concept that ties together a large subset of these emerging interaction styles. Based on this concept of RBI, we provide a framework that can be used to understand, compare, and relate current paths of recent HCI research as well as to analyze specific interaction designs. We believe that viewing interaction through the lens of RBI provides insights for design and uncovers gaps or opportunities for future research.", "citation": "Citations (721)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Tufts University", "Tufts University", "Tufts University", "Tufts University", "Tufts University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Robert J.
