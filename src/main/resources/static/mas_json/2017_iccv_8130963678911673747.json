This makes the process of capturing outdoor environment maps notoriously challenging since special equipment must be used. In this work, we propose an alternative approach. We first capture lighting with a regular, LDR omnidirectional camera, and aim to recover the HDR after the fact via a novel, learning-based inverse tonemapping method. We propose a deep autoencoder framework which regresses linear, high dynamic range data from non-linear, saturated, low dynamic range panoramas. We validate our method through a wide set of experiments on synthetic data, as well as on a novel dataset of real photographs with ground truth. Our approach finds applications in a variety of settings, ranging from outdoor light capture to image matching.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Laval University", "Beihang University", "Laval University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jinsong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jinsong", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lalonde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lalonde:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 10}
