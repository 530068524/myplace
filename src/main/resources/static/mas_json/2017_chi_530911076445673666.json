{"title": "Tunneled In: Drivers with Active Secondary Tasks Need More Time to Transition from Automation.", "fields": ["driving simulator", "simulation", "computer science", "automation"], "abstract": "In partially automated driving, rapid transitions of control present a severe hazard. How long does it take a driver to take back control of the vehicle when engaged with other non-driving tasks? In this driving simulator study, we examined the performance of participants (N=30) after an abrupt loss of automated vehicle control. We tested three transition time conditions, with an unstructured transition of control occurring 2s, 5s, or 8s before entering a curve. As participants were occupied with an active secondary task (playing a game on a tablet) while the automated driving mode was enabled, they needed to disengage from the task and regain control of the car when the transition occurred. Few drivers in the 2 second condition were able to safely negotiate the road hazard situation, while the majority of drivers in the 5 or 8 second conditions were able to navigate the hazard situation safely.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Brian K.
