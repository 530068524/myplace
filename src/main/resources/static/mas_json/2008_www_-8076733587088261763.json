In this scheme, instead of paying per click, the advertisers pay only when a user takes a specific action (e.g. fills out a form) or completes a transaction on their websites.   We focus on designing efficient and incentive compatible mechanisms that use this charging scheme. We describe a mechanism based on a sampling-based learning algorithm that under suitable assumptions is asymptotically individually rational, asymptotically Bayesian incentive compatible and asymptotically ex-ante efficient.   In particular, we demonstrate our mechanism for the case where the utility functions of the advertisers are independent and identically-distributed random variables as well as the case where they evolve like independent reflected Brownian motions.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Hamid Nazerzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nazerzadeh:Hamid", "Amin Saberi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saberi:Amin", "Rakesh Vohra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vohra:Rakesh"], "conf": "www", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
