{"title": "Steering with eyes closed: Mm-Wave beam steering without in-band measurement.", "fields": ["link budget", "beamwidth", "beam steering", "throughput", "beamforming"], "abstract": "Millimeter-wave communication achieves multi-Gbps data rates via highly directional beamforming to overcome pathloss and provide the desired SNR. Unfortunately, establishing communication with sufficiently narrow beamwidth to obtain the necessary link budget is a high overhead procedure in which the search space scales with device mobility and the product of the sender-receiver beam resolution. In this paper, we design, implement, and experimentally evaluate Blind Beam Steering (BBS) a novel architecture and algorithm that removes in-band overhead for directional mm-Wave link establishment. Our system architecture couples mm-Wave and legacy 2.4/5 GHz bands using out-of-band direction inference to establish (overhead-free) multi-Gbps mm-Wave communication. Further, BBS evaluates direction estimates retrieved from passively overheard 2.4/5 GHz frames to assure highest mm-Wave link quality on unobstructed direct paths. By removing in-band overhead, we leverage mm-Wave's very high throughput capabilities, beam-width scalability and provide robustness to mobility. We demonstrate that BBS achieves 97.8% accuracy estimating direction between pairing nodes using at least 5 detection band antennas. Further, BBS successfully detects unobstructed direct path conditions with an accuracy of 96.5% and reduces the IEEE 802.11ad beamforming training overhead by 81%.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "departments": ["IMDEA", "Rice University", "Rice University", "IMDEA"], "authors": ["Thomas Nitsche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nitsche:Thomas", "Adriana B.
