A novel and efficient nearest neighbor matching scheme, the ANN bilateral matching scheme, is proposed. Based on the proposed matching scheme, we first retrieve some partially similar images for each given test image from the training image database. The test image can be well explained by these retrieved images, with similar regions existing in the retrieved images for each region in the test image. Then, we match the test image to the retrieved training images with the ANN bilateral matching scheme, and parse the test image by integrating multiple cues in a markov random field. Experiment on three datasets shows our method achieved promising parsing accuracy and outperformed two state-of-the-art nonparametric image parsing methods.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Honghui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Honghui", "Tian Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Tian", "Xiaowu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiaowu", "Qinping Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Qinping", "Long Quan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quan:Long"], "pages": 8}
