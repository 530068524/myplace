{"title": "Architectural Specialization for Inter-Iteration Loop Dependence Patterns.", "fields": ["cache", "nested loop join", "microarchitecture", "spite", "instruction set"], "abstract": "Hardware specialization is an increasingly common technique to enable improved performance and energy efficiency in spite of the diminished benefits of technology scaling. This paper proposes a new approach called explicit loop specialization (XLOOPS) based on the idea of elegantly encoding inter-iteration loop dependence patterns in the instruction set. XLOOPS supports a variety of inter-iteration data-and control-dependence patterns for both single and nested loops. The XLOOPS hardware/software abstraction requires only lightweight changes to a general-purpose compiler to generate XLOOPS binaries and enables executing these binaries on: (1) traditional micro architectures with minimal performance impact, (2) specialized micro architectures to improve performance and/or energy efficiency, and (3) adaptive micro architectures that can seamlessly migrate loops between traditional and specialized execution to dynamically trade-off performance vs. Energy efficiency. We evaluate XLOOPS using a vertically integrated research methodology and show compelling performance and energy efficiency improvements compared to both simple and complex general-purpose processors.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Shreesha Srinath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinath:Shreesha", "Berkin Ilbeyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilbeyi:Berkin", "Mingxing Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Mingxing", "Gai Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Gai", "Zhiru Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhiru", "Christopher Batten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Batten:Christopher"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2014", "pages": 13}
