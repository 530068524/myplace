{"title": "Cost-efficient and differentiated data availability guarantees in data clouds.", "fields": ["data center", "server", "maximization", "application software", "cost efficiency"], "abstract": "Failures of any type are common in current datacenters. As data scales up, its availability becomes more complex, while different availability levels per application or per data item may be required. In this paper, we propose a self-managed key-value store that dynamically allocates the resources of a data cloud to several applications in a cost-efficient and fair way. Our approach offers and dynamically maintains multiple differentiated availability guarantees to each different application despite failures. We employ a virtual economy, where each data partition acts as an individual optimizer and chooses whether to migrate, replicate or remove itself based on net benefit maximization regarding the utility offered by the partition and its storage and maintenance cost. Comprehensive experimental evaluations suggest that our solution is highly scalable and adaptive to query rate variations and to resource upgrades/failures.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Nicolas Bonvin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonvin:Nicolas", "Thanasis G.
