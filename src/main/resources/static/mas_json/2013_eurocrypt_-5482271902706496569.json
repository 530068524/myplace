The standard interpretation of \u201cjust as well\u201d is that the translation from the real to the ideal world, usually called a simulator, is achieved by a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm. This means that a polynomial blow-up of the adversary\u2019s time and memory requirements is considered acceptable.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Gr\u00e9gory Demay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demay:Gr=eacute=gory", "Peter Gazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gazi:Peter", "Martin Hirt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirt:Martin", "Ueli Maurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maurer:Ueli"], "pages": 20}
