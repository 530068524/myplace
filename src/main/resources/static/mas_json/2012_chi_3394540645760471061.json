{"title": "Investigating the presence, form and behavior of virtual possessions in the context of a teen bedroom.", "fields": ["emerging technologies", "design research", "design methods", "information design", "bedroom"], "abstract": "Over the past several years, people have acquired more and more virtual possessions. While virtual possessions have become ubiquitous, little work exists to inform designers on how these growing collections should be displayed and how they should behave. We generated four design concepts that changed the form and behavior of these digital things, making them more present within a teen bedroom. We then conducted speed dating sessions to investigate how these new forms and behaviors influence perceptions of value. Sessions revealed how new technologies might better support self-exploration and reflection, as well as how they could complicate identity construction processes. Findings are interpreted to detail opportunities and tensions that can guide future research and practice in this emerging space.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["William Odom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Odom:William", "John Zimmerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmerman:John", "Jodi Forlizzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forlizzi:Jodi", "Hajin Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Hajin", "Stephanie Meier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meier:Stephanie", "Angela Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Angela"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
