{"title": "A Unified Robust Regression Model for Lasso-like Algorithms.", "fields": ["elastic net regularization", "robust regression", "regularization", "generalization", "lasso"], "abstract": "We develop a unified robust linear regression model and show that it is equivalent to a general regularization framework to encourage sparse-like structure that contains group Lasso and fused Lasso as specific examples. This provides a robustness interpretation of these widely applied Lasso-like algorithms, and allows us to construct novel generalizations of Lasso-like algorithms by considering different uncertainty sets. Using this robustness interpretation, we present new sparsity results, and establish the statistical consistency of the proposed regularized linear regression. This work extends a classical result from Xu et al. (2010) that relates standard Lasso with robust linear regression to learning problems with more general sparse-like structures, and provides new robustness-based tools to to understand learning problems with sparse-like structures.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Wenzhuo Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Wenzhuo", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
