{"title": "Meta-Graph Based Recommendation Fusion over Heterogeneous Information Networks.", "fields": ["recommender system", "data type", "matrix decomposition", "collaborative filtering", "lasso"], "abstract": "Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) is a natural and general representation of data in modern large commercial recommender systems which involve heterogeneous types of data. HIN based recommenders face two problems: how to represent the high-level semantics of recommendations and how to fuse the heterogeneous information to make recommendations. In this paper, we solve the two problems by first introducing the concept of meta-graph to HIN-based recommendation, and then solving the information fusion problem with a \"matrix factorization (MF) + factorization machine (FM)\" approach. For the similarities generated by each meta-graph, we perform standard MF to generate latent features for both users and items. With different meta-graph based features, we propose to use FM with Group lasso (FMG) to automatically learn from the observed ratings to effectively select useful meta-graph based features. Experimental results on two real-world datasets, Amazon and Yelp, show the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art FM and other HIN-based recommendation algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Huan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Huan", "Quanming Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Quanming", "Jianda Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianda", "Yangqiu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yangqiu", "Dik Lun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Dik_Lun"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
