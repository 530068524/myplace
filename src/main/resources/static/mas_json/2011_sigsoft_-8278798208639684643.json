It describes the techniques that are incorporated in a tool called PCCA (Producer-Consumer Conformance Analyzer), which attempts to (i) determine whether the consumer is prepared to accept all messages that the producer can emit, or (ii) find a counter-example: a message that the producer can emit and the consumer considers ill-formed.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Evan Driscoll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Driscoll:Evan", "Amanda Burton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burton:Amanda", "Thomas W.
