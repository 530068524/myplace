{"title": "Performance evaluation of NEC SX-9 using real science and engineering applications.", "fields": ["scalar processor", "memory bandwidth", "cache", "hpc challenge benchmark", "performance tuning"], "abstract": "This paper describes a new-generation vector parallel supercomputer, NEC SX-9 system. The SX-9 processor has an outstanding core to achieve over 100Gflop/s, and a software-controllable on-chip cache to keep the high ratio of the memory bandwidth to the floating-point operation rate. Moreover, its large SMP nodes of 16 vector processors with 1.6Tflop/s performance and 1TB memory are connected with dedicated network switches, which can achieve inter-node communication at 128GB/s per direction. The sustained performance of the SX-9 processor is evaluated using six practical applications in comparison with conventional vector processors and the latest scalar processor such as Nehalem-EP. Based on the results, this paper discusses the performance tuning strategies for new-generation vector systems. An SX-9 system of 16 nodes is also evaluated by using the HPC challenge benchmark suite and a CFD code. Those evaluation results clarify the highest sustained performance and scalability of the SX-9 system.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Tohoku University", "NEC", "Tohoku University", "Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology", "NEC Software Tohoku"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Takashi Soga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soga:Takashi", "Akihiro Musa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Musa:Akihiro", "Youichi Shimomura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimomura:Youichi", "Ryusuke Egawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egawa:Ryusuke", "Ken'ichi Itakura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Itakura:Ken=ichi", "Hiroyuki Takizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takizawa:Hiroyuki", "Koki Okabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okabe:Koki", "Hiroaki Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Hiroaki"], "pages": -1}
