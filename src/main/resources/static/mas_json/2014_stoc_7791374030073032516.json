An algorithm is called a tester for  P  if, given a query access to the input function  f , with high probability, it accepts when  f  satisfies  P  and rejects when  f  is \"far\" from satisfying  P . In this paper, we give a characterization of affine-invariant properties that are (two-sided error) testable with a constant number of queries. The characterization is stated in terms of decomposition theorems, which roughly claim that any function can be decomposed into a structured part that is a function of a constant number of polynomials, and a pseudo-random part whose Gowers norm is small. We first give an algorithm that tests whether the structured part of the input function has a specific form. Then we show that an affine-invariant property is testable with a constant number of queries if and only if it can be reduced to the problem of testing whether the structured part of the input function is close to one of a constant number of candidates.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yuichi Yoshida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshida:Yuichi"], "pages": 10}
