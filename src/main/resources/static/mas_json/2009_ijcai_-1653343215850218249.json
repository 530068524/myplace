While existing Gaussian process models focus on modeling one single relation, we present a generalized GP model, named multi-relational Gaussian process model, that is able to deal with an arbitrary number of relations in a domain of interest. The proposed model is analyzed in the context of bipartite, directed, and undirected univariate relations. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that exploiting the correlations among different entity types and relations can indeed improve prediction performance.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Siemens"], "authors": ["Zhao Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Zhao", "Kristian Kersting.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kersting:Kristian", "Volker Tresp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tresp:Volker"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
