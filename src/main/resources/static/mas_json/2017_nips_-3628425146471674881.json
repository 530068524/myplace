{"title": "Eigenvalue Decay Implies Polynomial-Time Learnability for Neural Networks.", "fields": ["sigmoid function", "open problem", "gramian matrix", "gaussian", "marginal distribution"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning function classes computed by neural networks with various activations (e.g. ReLU or Sigmoid), a task believed to be computationally intractable in the worst-case. A major open problem is to understand the minimal assumptions under which these classes admit provably efficient algorithms. In this work we show that a natural distributional assumption corresponding to {\\em eigenvalue decay} of the Gram matrix yields polynomial-time algorithms in the non-realizable setting for expressive classes of networks (e.g. feed-forward networks of ReLUs). We make no assumptions on the structure of the network or the labels. Given sufficiently-strong eigenvalue decay, we obtain {\\em fully}-polynomial time algorithms in {\\em all} the relevant parameters with respect to square-loss. This is the first purely distributional assumption that leads to polynomial-time algorithms for networks of ReLUs. Further, unlike prior distributional assumptions (e.g., the marginal distribution is Gaussian), eigenvalue decay has been observed in practice on common data sets.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Surbhi Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Surbhi", "Adam R.
