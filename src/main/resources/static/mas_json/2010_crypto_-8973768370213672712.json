{"title": "Toward Basing Fully Homomorphic Encryption on Worst-Case Hardness.", "fields": ["homomorphic encryption", "key generation", "subset sum problem", "prime ideal", "public key cryptography"], "abstract": "Gentry proposed a fully homomorphic public key encryption scheme that uses ideal lattices. He based the security of his scheme on the hardness of two problems: an average-case decision problem over ideal lattices, and the sparse (or \"low-weight\") subset sum problem (SSSP).\n\nWe provide a key generation algorithm for Gentry's scheme that generates ideal lattices according to a \"nice\" average-case distribution. Then, we prove a worst-case / average-case connection that bases Gentry's scheme (in part) on the quantum hardness of the shortest independent vector problem (SIVP) over ideal lattices in the worst-case. (We cannot remove the need to assume that the SSSP is hard.) Our worst-case / average-case connection is the first where the average-case lattice is an ideal lattice, which seems to be necessary to support the security of Gentry's scheme.", "citation": "Citations (160)", "departments": ["IBM"], "authors": ["Craig Gentry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentry:Craig"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2010", "pages": 22}
