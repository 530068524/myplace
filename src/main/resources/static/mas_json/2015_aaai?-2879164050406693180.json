{"title": "Game-Theoretic Approach for Non-Cooperative Planning.", "fields": ["multi agent system", "nash equilibrium", "stochastic game", "deferral", "schedule"], "abstract": "When two or more self-interested agents put their plans to execution in the same environment, conflicts may arise as a consequence, for instance, of a common utilization of resources. In this case, an agent can postpone the execution of a particular action, if this punctually solves the conflict, or it can resort to execute a different plan if the agent's payoff significantly diminishes due to the action deferral. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic approach to non-cooperative planning that helps predict before execution what plan schedules agents will adopt so that the set of strategies of all agents constitute a Nash equilibrium. We perform some experiments and discuss the solutions obtained with our game-theoretical approach, analyzing how the conflicts between the plans determine the strategic behavior of the agents.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Valencia", "Polytechnic University of Valencia"], "authors": ["Jaume Jord\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jord=aacute=n:Jaume", "Eva Onaindia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onaindia:Eva"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
