Matching Erd\u0151s\u2019 result with a constructive proof is considered a central problem in combinatorics, that has gained a significant attention in the literature. The state of the art result was obtained in the celebrated paper by Barak, Rao, Shaltiel, and Wigderson who constructed a 2 2 (loglog n ) 1\u2212\u03b1   -Ramsey graph, for some small universal constant \u03b1 > 0.   In this work, we significantly improve this result and construct 2 (loglog n )  c   -Ramsey graphs, for some universal constant  c . In the language of theoretical computer science, this resolves the problem of explicitly constructing dispersers for two  n -bit sources with entropy ( n ). In fact, our disperser is a zero-error disperser that outputs a constant fraction of the entropy. Prior to this work, such dispersers could only support entropy \u03a9( n ).", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Gil Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Gil"], "pages": 7}
