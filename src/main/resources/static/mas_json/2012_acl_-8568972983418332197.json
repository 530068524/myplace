{"title": "Translation Model Adaptation for Statistical Machine Translation with Monolingual Topic Information.", "fields": ["example based machine translation", "machine translation", "natural language processing", "nist", "probability distribution"], "abstract": "To adapt a translation model trained from the data in one domain to another, previous works paid more attention to the studies of parallel corpus while ignoring the in-domain monolingual corpora which can be obtained more easily. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for translation model adaptation by utilizing in-domain monolingual topic information instead of the in-domain bilingual corpora, which incorporates the topic information into translation probability estimation. Our method establishes the relationship between the out-of-domain bilingual corpus and the in-domain monolingual corpora via topic mapping and phrase-topic distribution probability estimation from in-domain monolingual corpora. Experimental result on the NIST Chinese-English translation task shows that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline system.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Xiamen University", "Baidu", "Baidu", "Xiamen University", "Xiamen University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jinsong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Jinsong", "Hua Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0003:Hua", "Haifeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haifeng", "Yidong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yidong", "Xiaodong Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Xiaodong", "Huailin Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Huailin", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun"], "pages": 10}
