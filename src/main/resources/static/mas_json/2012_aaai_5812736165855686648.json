Several approaches have been reported for mining comparable entities from Web sources to improve user experience in comparing entities online. However, these efforts extract only entities explicitly compared in the corpora, and may exclude entities that occur less-frequently but potentially comparable. To build a more complete comparison machine that can infer such missing relations, here we develop a solution to predict transitivity of known comparable relations. Named CLIQUEGROW, our approach predicts missing links given a comparable entity graph obtained from versus query logs. Our approach achieved the highest F1-score among five link prediction approaches and a commercial comparison engine provided by Yahoo!.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Myungha Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:Myungha", "Jin-Woo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jin=Woo", "Seung-won Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Seung=won"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
