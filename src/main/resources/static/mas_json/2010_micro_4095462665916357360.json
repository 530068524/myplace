One key reason is the nondeterminism of thread interaction, which may result in one code input producing different outputs in different runs. Unfortunately, enforcing determinism by construction typically comes at a performance, hardware, or programmability cost. An alternative is to check during testing whether code is deterministic. This paper presents Instant Check, a novel technique that checks determinism with a very small runtime overhead while requiring only a minor hardware extension. During code testing, Instant-Check can check whether the code under test ends up in a deterministic state in various runs. The idea is to compute a 64-bit hash of the memory state and compare the hashes of different test runs that have the same input. If two runs have different hashes, Instant-Check reports state nondeterminism. For efficient operation, Instant Checkuses on-the-fly incremental hashing in hardware. The hash is kept in a per-core 64-bit register, which trivially supports virtualization, migration, and context switching. We use Instant Check to understand the determinism properties of 17 popular applications, including Sphinx3, PBZip2, PARSEC, and SPLASH-2. Instant Check incurs a negligible average runtime overhead of 0.3% over native testing runs. We also show how using Instant Check programmers can find bugs and discuss other applications of fast memory-state hashing. While using Instant Check, we found a real bug in the widely used PARSEC benchmark.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Adrian Nistor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nistor:Adrian", "Darko Marinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinov:Darko", "Josep Torrellas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torrellas:Josep"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
