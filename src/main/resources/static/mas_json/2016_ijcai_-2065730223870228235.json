Prior work framed learning a heuristic as an ordinary regression problem. However, in a greedy best-first search, the ordering of states induced by a heuristic is more indicative of the resulting planner's performance than mean squared error. Thus, we instead frame learning a heuristic as a learning to rank problem which we solve using a RankSVM formulation. Additionally, we introduce new methods for computing features that capture temporal interactions in an approximate plan. Our experiments on recent International Planning Competition problems show that the RankSVM learned heuristics outperform both the original heuristics and heuristics learned through ordinary regression.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Caelan Reed Garrett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garrett:Caelan_Reed", "Leslie Pack Kaelbling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaelbling:Leslie_Pack", "Tom\u00e1s Lozano-P\u00e9rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lozano=P=eacute=rez:Tom=aacute=s"], "pages": 7}
