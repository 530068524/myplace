We introduce a systematic method for large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of online activity for thousands of mobile users across 79 buildings over 100 web domains. We propose a modeling approach based on self-organizing maps for discovering, organizing and visualizing different mobile users' trends from billions of WLAN and netflow records. We find surprisingly that users' trends based on domains or locations can be modeled using a self-organizing map with clearly distinct characteristics. This is the first study to acquire such detailed results for wireless users Internet access patterns.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Saeed Moghaddam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moghaddam:Saeed", "Ahmed Helmy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmy:Ahmed"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
