{"title": "Attacks Only Get Better: Password Recovery Attacks Against RC4 in TLS.", "fields": ["rc4", "password", "application layer", "proof of concept", "truism"], "abstract": "Despite recent high-profile attacks on the RC4 algorithm in TLS, its usage is still running at about 30% of all TLS traffic. We provide new attacks against RC4 in TLS that are focussed on recovering user passwords, still the pre-eminent means of user authentication on the Internet today. Our new attacks use a generally applicable Bayesian inference approach to transform a priori information about passwords in combination with gathered ciphertexts into a posteriori likelihoods for passwords. We report on extensive simulations of the attacks. We also report on a \"proof of concept\" implementation of the attacks for a specific application layer protocol, namely BasicAuth. Our work validates the truism that attacks only get better with time: we obtain good success rates in recovering user passwords with 226 encryptions, whereas the previous generation of attacks required around 234 encryptions to recover an HTTP session cookie.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "Royal Holloway, University of London"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Christina Garman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garman:Christina", "Kenneth G.
