{"title": "Probabilistic detection of short events, with application to critical care monitoring.", "fields": ["inference", "data collection", "probabilistic logic", "raw data", "statistical model"], "abstract": "We describe an application of probabilistic modeling and inference technology to the problem of analyzing sensor data in the setting of an intensive care unit (ICU). In particular, we consider the arterial-line blood pressure sensor, which is subject to frequent data artifacts that cause false alarms in the ICU and make the raw data almost useless for automated decision making. The problem is complicated by the fact that the sensor data are averaged over fixed intervals whereas the events causing data artifacts may occur at any time and often have durations significantly shorter than the data collection interval. We show that careful modeling of the sensor, combined with a general technique for detecting sub-interval events and estimating their duration, enables detection of artifacts and accurate estimation of the underlying blood pressure values. Our model's performance identifying artifacts is superior to two other classifiers' and about as good as a physician's.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University", "National U. of  ... reland, Galway", "U.C.
