{"title": "Progressive Reasoning over Recursively-Defined Strings.", "fields": ["recursion", "internet security", "strings", "string", "solver"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of reasoning over an expressive constraint language for unbounded strings. The difficulty comes from \u201crecursively defined\u201d functions such as replace, making state-of-the-art algorithms non-terminating. Our first contribution is a progressive search algorithm to not only mitigate the problem of non-terminating reasoning but also guide the search towards a \u201cminimal solution\u201d when the input formula is in fact satisfiable. We have implemented our method using the state-of-the-art Z3 framework. Importantly, we have enabled conflict clause learning for string theory so that our solver can be used effectively in the setting of program verification. Finally, our experimental evaluation shows leadership in a large benchmark suite, and a first deployment for another benchmark suite which requires reasoning about string formulas of a class that has not been solved before.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Minh-Thai Trinh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trinh:Minh=Thai", "Duc-Hiep Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Duc=Hiep", "Joxan Jaffar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaffar:Joxan"], "pages": 23}
