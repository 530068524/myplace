The success of these solvers has been theoretically explained by showing that the clause learning framework is an implementation of a proof system which is as poweful as resolution. However, exponential lower bounds are known for resolution, which suggests that significant advances in SAT solving must come from implementations of more powerful proof systems.\n\nWe present a clause learning SAT solver that uses extended resolution. It is based on a restriction of the application of the extension rule. This solver outperforms existing solvers on application instances from recent SAT competitions as well as on instances that are provably hard for resolution, such as XOR-SAT instances.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["university of lille", "university of lille", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Gilles Audemard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Audemard:Gilles", "George Katsirelos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katsirelos:George", "Laurent Simon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simon:Laurent"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
