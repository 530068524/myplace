First, from a set of random depth features, Random Forest is used to infer a set of label probabilities for each data sample. This vector of probabilities is used as unary term in \u03b1-\u03b2 swap Graph-cuts algorithm. Moreover, depth of spatio-temporal neighboring data points are used as boundary potentials. Results on a new multi-label human depth data set show high performance in terms of segmentation overlapping of the novel methodology compared to classical approaches.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Computer Vision ... arcelona, Spain", "Inst. of Inform ...  1113, Bulgaria", "Inst. of Inform ...  1113, Bulgaria", "Computer Vision ... arcelona, Spain", "Computer Vision ... arcelona, Spain"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez-Vela.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hern=aacute=ndez=Vela:Antonio", "Nadezhda Zlateva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zlateva:Nadezhda", "Alexander Marinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinov:Alexander", "Miguel Reyes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reyes:Miguel", "Petia Radeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radeva:Petia", "Dimo Dimov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimov:Dimo", "Sergio Escalera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Escalera:Sergio"], "pages": 7}
