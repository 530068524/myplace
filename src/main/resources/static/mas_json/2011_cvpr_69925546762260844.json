The approach combines the output of local detectors with a non-parametric set of global models for the part locations based on over one thousand hand-labeled exemplar images. By assuming that the global models generate the part locations as hidden variables, we derive a Bayesian objective function. This function is optimized using a consensus of models for these hidden variables. The resulting localizer handles a much wider range of expression, pose, lighting and occlusion than prior ones. We show excellent performance on a new dataset gathered from the internet and show that our localizer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the less challenging BioID dataset.", "citation": "Citations (618)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Columbia University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of California, San Diego", "University of Washington", "Kriegman-Belhum ... on Technologies", "Kriegman-Belhum ... on Technologies", "Kriegman-Belhum ... on Technologies", "Kriegman-Belhum ... on Technologies"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Peter N.
