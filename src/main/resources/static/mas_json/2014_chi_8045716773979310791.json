We held a workshop with 5 PD patients and 2 carers exploring perceptions of Glass. This was followed by 5-day field trials of Glass with 4 PD patients, where participants wore the device during everyday activities at home and in public. We report generally positive responses to Glass as a device to instil confidence and safety for this potentially vulnerable group. We also raise concerns related to the potential for Glass to reaffirm dependency on others and stigmatise wearers.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "University of Sussex", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Roisin McNaney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McNaney:Roisin", "John Vines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vines:John", "Daniel Roggen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roggen:Daniel", "Madeline Balaam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balaam:Madeline", "Pengfei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Pengfei", "Ivan Poliakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poliakov:Ivan", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick"], "pages": 4}
