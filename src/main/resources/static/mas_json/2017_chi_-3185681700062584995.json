{"title": "Advancing UX Education: A Model for Integrated Studio Pedagogy.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "pedagogy", "curriculum", "studio", "multimedia"], "abstract": "The rapid growth of the UX profession has led to an increased need for qualified practitioners and a proliferation of UX educational programs offered in both academia and industry. In this note, we present the design and initial evaluation of a new studio-based undergraduate program in UX--the first of its kind at a large, research-intensive US university. The program includes several curricular innovations, such as an integrated studio pedagogy in which six topical strands are interwoven across two types of studios. These studios are interconnected and span five semesters of the undergraduate experience. We present the curriculum model and the foundational principles that informed its design. We describe the two types of studios and their interconnection, and present early evaluation data showing that students are building valuable skills. The program described in this note provides a trailblazing model for UX pedagogy at the undergraduate level.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mihaela Vorvoreanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vorvoreanu:Mihaela", "Colin M.
