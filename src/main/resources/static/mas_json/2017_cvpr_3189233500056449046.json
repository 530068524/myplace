One indispensable component is non-maximum suppression (NMS), a post-processing algorithm responsible for merging all detections that belong to the same object. The de facto standard NMS algorithm is still fully hand-crafted, suspiciously simple, and \u2014 being based on greedy clustering with a fixed distance threshold \u2014 forces a trade-off between recall and precision. We propose a new network architecture designed to perform NMS, using only boxes and their score. We report experiments for person detection on PETS and for general object categories on the COCO dataset. Our approach shows promise providing improved localization and occlusion handling.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jan Hendrik Hosang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosang:Jan_Hendrik", "Rodrigo Benenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benenson:Rodrigo", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 9}
