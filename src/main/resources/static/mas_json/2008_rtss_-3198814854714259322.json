New schedulability tests are presented for determining whether a set of sporadic tasks with arbitrary relative deadlines can be scheduled under either preemptive or non-preemptive GEDF so that pre-defined tardiness bounds are met. These tests are of pseudo-polynomial time complexity, and can be used in hard real-time, soft real-time, and mixed contexts.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Hennadiy Leontyev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leontyev:Hennadiy", "James H.
