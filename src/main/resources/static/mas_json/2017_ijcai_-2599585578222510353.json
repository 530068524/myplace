However, the previous neural models cannot extract the complicated feature compositions as the traditional methods with discrete features. In this work, we propose a feature-enriched neural model for joint Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging task. Specifically, to simulate the feature templates of traditional discrete feature based models, we use different filters to model the complex compositional features with convolutional and pooling layer, and then utilize long distance dependency information with recurrent layer. Experimental results on five different datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed model.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xinchi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xinchi", "Xipeng Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Xipeng", "Xuanjing Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xuanjing"], "pages": 7}
