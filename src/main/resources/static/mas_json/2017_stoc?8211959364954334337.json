The main result of the paper is an almost optimal bound on the probability that a random restriction of a PTF is not close to a constant function, where a boolean function  g  is called I\ufffd-close to constant if, for some  v \u00e2  {1,\u00e2  1}, we have  g ( x )= v  for all but at most I\ufffd fraction of inputs. We show for every PTF  f  of degree  d \u00e2 \ufffd 1, and parameters 0 r \u00e2 \ufffd 1/16, that      Pr  \ufffd \u00e2 \ufffd\ufffd  R   r   \ufffd [ f  \ufffd  \ufffd is not \ufffd I\ufffd\ufffd -close to constant]\ufffd \u00e2 \ufffd\ufffd   \u00e2            r      \ufffd\u00b7\ufffd (log r  \u00e2  1 \ufffd \ufffd\u00b7\ufffd logI\ufffd \u00e2  1 )  O ( d  2 ) ,\ufffd \ufffd      where \ufffd \u00e2 \ufffd  R   r   is a random restriction leaving each variable, independently, free with probability  r , and otherwise assigning it 1 or \u00e2  1 uniformly at random. In fact, we show a more general result for random  block  restrictions: given an arbitrary partitioning of input variables into  m  blocks, a random block restriction picks a uniformly random block \u00e2  \u00e2   [ m ] and assigns 1 or \u00e2  1, uniformly at random, to all variable outside the chosen block \u00e2  . We prove the Block Restriction Lemma saying that a PTF  f  of degree  d  becomes I\ufffd-close to constant when hit with a random block restriction, except with probability at most  m  \u00e2  1/2  \ufffd\u00b7 (log m \ufffd\u00b7 logI\ufffd \u00e2  1 )  O ( d  2 ) . As an application of our Restriction Lemma, we prove lower bounds against constant-depth circuits with PTF gates of any degree 1\u00e2 \ufffd  d \u00e2 \ufffd \u00e2  log n /loglog n , generalizing the recent bounds against constant-depth circuits with linear threshold gates (LTF gates) proved by Kane and Williams ( STOC , 2016) and Chen, Santhanam, and Srinivasan ( CCC , 2016). In particular, we show that there is an  n -variate boolean function  F   n   \u00e2    P  such that every depth-2 circuit with PTF gates of degree  d \u00e2 \ufffd 1 that computes  F   n   must have at least ( n  3/2+1/ d  )\ufffd\u00b7 (log n ) \u00e2   O ( d  2 )  wires. For constant depths greater than 2, we also show average-case lower bounds for such circuits with super-linear number of wires. These are the first super-linear bounds on the number of wires for circuits with PTF gates. We also give short proofs of the optimal-exponent average sensitivity bound for degree- d  PTFs due to Kane ( Computational Complexity , 2014), and the Littlewood-Offord type anticoncentration bound for degree- d  multilinear polynomials due to Meka, Nguyen, and Vu ( Theory of Computing , 2016). Finally, we give  derandomized  versions of our Block Restriction Lemma and Littlewood-Offord type anticoncentration bounds, using a pseudorandom generator for PTFs due to Meka and Zuckerman ( SICOMP , 2013).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "University of California, San Diego", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Valentine Kabanets.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kabanets:Valentine", "Daniel M.
