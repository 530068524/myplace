In particular, we address semantic variations (sub-tags) of the tag. Each video in the training set is assumed to be associated with a sub-tag label, and we treat this sub-tag label as latent information. A latent learning framework based on LogitBoost is proposed, which jointly considers both the tag label and the latent sub-tag label. The latent sub-tag information is exploited in our framework to assist the learning of our end goal, i.e., tag prediction. We use the cowatch information to initialize the learning process. In experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves significantly better results over baselines on a large-scale testing video set which contains about 50 million YouTube videos.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Google"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Weilong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Weilong", "George Toderici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toderici:George"], "pages": 8}
