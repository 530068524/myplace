However, it requires a lot of computational resources and tremendous processes in order to setup an execution environment based on hardware acceleration such as GPGPU. Therefore, providing DNN applications to end-users is very hard. To solve this problem, we have developed an installation-free web browser-based DNN execution framework, WebDNN. WebDNN optimizes the trained DNN model to compress model data and accelerate the execution. It executes the DNN model with novel JavaScript API to achieve zero-overhead execution. Empirical evaluations show that it achieves more than two-hundred times the unusual acceleration. WebDNN is an open source framework and you can download it from https://github.com/mil-tokyo/webdnn.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Masatoshi Hidaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hidaka:Masatoshi", "Yuichiro Kikura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kikura:Yuichiro", "Yoshitaka Ushiku.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ushiku:Yoshitaka", "Tatsuya Harada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harada:Tatsuya"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
