We propose the Novel Object Captioner (NOC), a deep visual semantic captioning model that can describe a large number of object categories not present in existing image-caption datasets. Our model takes advantage of external sources \u2013 labeled images from object recognition datasets, and semantic knowledge extracted from unannotated text. We propose minimizing a joint objective which can learn from these diverse data sources and leverage distributional semantic embeddings, enabling the model to generalize and describe novel objects outside of image-caption datasets. We demonstrate that our model exploits semantic information to generate captions for hundreds of object categories in the ImageNet object recognition dataset that are not observed in MSCOCO image-caption training data, as well as many categories that are observed very rarely. Both automatic evaluations and human judgements show that our model considerably outperforms prior work in being able to describe many more categories of objects.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Subhashini Venugopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venugopalan:Subhashini", "Lisa Anne Hendricks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hendricks:Lisa_Anne", "Marcus Rohrbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rohrbach:Marcus", "Raymond J.
