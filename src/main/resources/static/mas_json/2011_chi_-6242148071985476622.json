Many of those changes are invisible to us - they have become habits, deeply engrained in our society. To make us more aware of our bodily ways of living with mobiles and open the design space for novel ways of designing mobiles and their interactions, we decided to study one of the last groups of users on earth who had not been exposed to mobiles: the people of Vanuatu. As they had so recently started using mobiles, their use was still in flux: the fragility of the mobile was unusual to them as was the need to move in order to find coverage. They were still getting used to carrying their mobiles and keeping them safe. Their encounters with mobile use exposed the need to consider somaesthetics practices when designing mobiles as they profoundly affect our bodily ways of being in the world.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stockholm University", "Stockholm University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Pedro Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Pedro", "Kristina H\u00f6\u00f6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml==ouml=k:Kristina"], "pages": 10}
