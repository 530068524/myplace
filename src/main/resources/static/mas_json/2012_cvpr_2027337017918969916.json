However, the detailed annotation of cancer cells is often an ambiguous and challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new learning method, multiple clustered instance learning (MCIL), to classify, segment and cluster cancer cells in colon histopathology images. The proposed MCIL method simultaneously performs image-level classification (cancer vs. non-cancer image), pixel-level segmentation (cancer vs. non-cancer tissue), and patch-level clustering (cancer subclasses). We embed the clustering concept into the multiple instance learning (MIL) setting and derive a principled solution to perform the above three tasks in an integrated framework. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of MCIL in analyzing colon cancers.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Yan", "Jun-Yan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jun=Yan", "Eric I-Chao Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Eric_I=Chao", "Zhuowen Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Zhuowen"], "pages": 8}
