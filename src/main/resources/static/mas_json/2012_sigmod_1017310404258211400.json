We focus in this tutorial on a particular form of crowdsourcing, namely crowd (or mob) datasourcing whose goal is to obtain, aggregate or process data. We overview crowd datasourcing solutions in various contexts, explain the need for a principled solution, describe advances towards achieving such a solution, and highlight remaining gaps.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Daniel Deutch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deutch:Daniel", "Tova Milo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milo:Tova"], "pages": 4}
