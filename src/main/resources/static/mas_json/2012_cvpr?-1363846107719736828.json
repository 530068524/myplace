Although binary codes are motivated by their use as direct indices (addresses) into a hash table, codes longer than 32 bits are not being used in this way, as it was thought to be ineffective. We introduce a rigorous way to build multiple hash tables on binary code substrings that enables exact K-nearest neighbor search in Hamming space. The algorithm is straightforward to implement, storage efficient, and it has sub-linear run-time behavior for uniformly distributed codes. Empirical results show dramatic speed-ups over a linear scan baseline and for datasets with up to one billion items, 64- or 128-bit codes, and search radii up to 25 bits.", "citation": "Citations (193)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mohammad Norouzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norouzi_0002:Mohammad", "Ali Punjani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Punjani:Ali", "David J.
