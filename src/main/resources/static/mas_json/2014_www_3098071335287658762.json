Collaborative filtering approaches to recommendation systems typically assume that the rating matrix (e.g., movie ratings by viewers) is low-rank. In this paper, we examine an alternative approach in which the rating matrix is locally low-rank. Concretely, we assume that the rating matrix is low-rank within certain neighborhoods of the metric space defined by (user, item) pairs. We combine a recent approach for local low-rank approximation based on the Frobenius norm with a general empirical risk minimization for ranking losses. Our experiments indicate that the combination of a mixture of local low-rank matrices each of which was trained to minimize a ranking loss outperforms many of the currently used state-of-the-art recommendation systems. Moreover, our method is easy to parallelize, making it a viable approach for large scale real-world rank-based recommendation systems.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Google", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Amazon.com", "Google"], "authors": ["Joonseok Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joonseok", "Samy Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Samy", "Seungyeon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seungyeon", "Guy Lebanon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lebanon:Guy", "Yoram Singer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singer:Yoram"], "conf": "www", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
