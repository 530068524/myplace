The investigation shows how innovations around 'crossposting' to create a more persistent form of visual data management were important. It describes how these innovations produced an improvised case management system around which members of the pet-advocacy crowd could collectively work to help displaced pets. The paper connects to the CSCW and organizational science literature to consider how this emergent community articulated work and structured the mission of the Page.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Joanne I.
