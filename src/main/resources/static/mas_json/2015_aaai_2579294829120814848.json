{"title": "Logic Programming in Assumption-Based Argumentation Revisited - Semantics and Graphical Representation.", "fields": ["multimodal logic", "well founded semantics", "game semantics", "formal semantics", "axiomatic semantics"], "abstract": "Logic Programming and Argumentation Theory have been existing side by side as two separate, yet related, techniques in the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning for many years. When Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) was first introduced in the nineties, the authors showed how a logic program can be encoded in an ABA framework and proved that the stable semantics of a logic program corresponds to the stable extension semantics of the ABA framework encoding this logic program. We revisit this initial work by proving that the 3-valued stable semantics of a logic program coincides with the complete semantics of the encoding ABA framework, and that the L-stable semantics of this logic program coincides with the semi-stable semantics of the encoding ABA framework. Furthermore, we show how to graphically represent the structure of a logic program encoded in an ABA framework and that not only logic programming and ABA semantics but also Abstract Argumentation semantics can be easily applied to a logic program using these graphical representations.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Claudia Schulz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schulz_0001:Claudia", "Francesca Toni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toni:Francesca"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
