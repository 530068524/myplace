We give definitions, relations between them, generic attacks and two transforms of FPE schemes to IB-FPE schemes. As a special case, we introduce and cover identity-based tweakable blockciphers. We apply all this to analyze DFF, an FPE scheme proposed to NIST for standardization.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Florida State University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Viet Tung Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Viet_Tung"], "pages": 18}
