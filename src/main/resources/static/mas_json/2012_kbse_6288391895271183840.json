{"title": "Automatic recovery of statecharts from procedural code.", "fields": ["transmission control protocol", "implementation", "procedural programming", "finite state machine", "java"], "abstract": "We have developed a static-analysis algorithm that extracts statecharts from procedural implementations of state machines. The extracted statecharts are semantically-equivalent to the original program, and can be used for further development instead of the procedural code. We have implemented this algorithm in a tool called StatRec. We report on the results of running StatRec on a number of examples, including an implementation of the TCP protocol.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "IBM"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Moria Abadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abadi:Moria", "Yishai A.
