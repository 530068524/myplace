However, the recent prevalence of markets specializing in zero-day exploits on the darknet make exploits widely available to potential attackers. The cost associated with these sophisticated kits generally precludes penetration testers from simply obtaining such exploits \u145b so an alternative approach is needed to understand what exploits an attacker will most likely purchase and how to defend against them. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven security game framework to model an attacker and provide policy recommendations to the defender. In addition to providing a formal framework and algorithms to develop strategies, we present experimental results from applying our framework, for various system configurations, on real-world exploit market data actively mined from the dark-net.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["John Robertson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robertson:John", "Vivin Paliath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paliath:Vivin", "Jana Shakarian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shakarian:Jana", "Amanda Thart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thart:Amanda", "Paulo Shakarian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shakarian:Paulo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 6}
