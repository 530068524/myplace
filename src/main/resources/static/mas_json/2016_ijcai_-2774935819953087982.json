{"title": "Optimal Status Enforcement in Abstract Argumentation.", "fields": ["enforcement", "argumentation theory", "argumentation framework", "semantics", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present complexity results and algorithms for optimal status enforcement in abstract argumentation. Status enforcement is the task of adjusting a given argumentation framework (AF) to support given positive and negative argument statuses, i.e., to accept and reject specific arguments. We study optimal status enforcement as the problem of finding a structurally closest AF supporting given argument statuses. We establish complexity results for optimal status enforcement under several central AF semantics, develop constraint-based algorithms for NP and second-level complete variants of the problem, and empirically evaluate the procedures.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Andreas Niskanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niskanen:Andreas", "Johannes Peter Wallner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wallner:Johannes_Peter", "Matti J\u00e4rvisalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=auml=rvisalo:Matti"], "pages": 7}
