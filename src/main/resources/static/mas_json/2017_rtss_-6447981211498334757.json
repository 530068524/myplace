{"title": "Functionally and Temporally Correct Simulation of Cyber-Systems for Automotive Systems.", "fields": ["real time simulation", "cyber physical system", "scheduling", "correctness", "automotive industry"], "abstract": "The current simulation tools used in the automotive industry do not correctly model timing behaviors of cyber-systems such as varying execution times and preemptions. Thus, they cannot correctly predict the real control performance. Motivated by this limitation, this paper proposes functionally and temporally correct simulation for the cyber-side of an automotive system. The key idea is to keep the data and time correctness only at physical interaction points and enjoy freedom of scheduling simulated jobs for all other cases. This way, the proposed approach significantly improves the real-time simulation capacity of the state-of-the-art simulation methods while keeping the functional and temporal correctness.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Kyoung-Soo We.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/We:Kyoung=Soo", "Seunggon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seunggon", "Wonseok Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wonseok", "Chang-Gun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chang=Gun"], "pages": 12}
