Software development projects require that various types of traces be modeled between and within development artifacts. For any given artifact (e.g., requirements, architecture models and source code), Tarski allows the user to specify new trace types and their configurable semantics, while, using the semantics, it automatically infers new traces based on existing traces provided by the user, and checks the consistency of traces. It has been evaluated on three industrial case studies in the automotive domain (https://modelwriter.github.io/Tarski/).", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Wageningen University and Research Centre", "University of Luxembourg", "Wageningen University and Research Centre", "Ege University"], "authors": ["Ferhat Erata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erata:Ferhat", "Arda Goknil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goknil:Arda", "Bedir Tekinerdogan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tekinerdogan:Bedir", "Geylani Kardas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kardas:Geylani"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
