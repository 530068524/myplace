Applications of bonsai trees include:\n\nAn efficient, stateless \u2018hash-and-sign\u2019 signature scheme in the standard model (i.e., no random oracles), and\n\nThe first hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) scheme (also in the standard model) that does not rely on bilinear pairings.\n\nInterestingly, the abstract properties of bonsai trees seem to have no known realization in conventional number-theoretic cryptography.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "IBM", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Cryptology & In ... he Netherlands"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["David Cash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cash:David", "Dennis Hofheinz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofheinz:Dennis", "Eike Kiltz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiltz:Eike", "Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris"], "pages": 30}
