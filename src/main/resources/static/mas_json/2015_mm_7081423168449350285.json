{"title": "Theia: A Fast and Scalable Structure-from-Motion Library.", "fields": ["structure from motion", "multimedia", "giant impact hypothesis", "scalability", "modular design"], "abstract": "In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive multi-view geometry library, Theia, that focuses on large-scale SfM. In addition to state-of-the-art scalable SfM pipelines, the library provides numerous tools that are useful for students, researchers, and industry experts in the field of multi-view geometry. Theia contains clean code that is well documented (with code comments and the website) and easy to extend. The modular design allows for users to easily implement and experiment with new algorithms within our current pipeline without having to implement a full end-to-end SfM pipeline themselves. Theia has already gathered a large number of diverse users from universities, startups, and industry and we hope to continue to gather users and active contributors from the open-source community.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Christopher Sweeney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sweeney:Christopher", "Tobias H\u00f6llerer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=llerer:Tobias", "Matthew Turk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turk:Matthew"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
