The copy-on-write nature of the flash translation layer and the fast random access makes flash memory the right medium to support such an interface. We further develop a novel commit protocol called cyclic commit for TxFlash; the protocol has been specified formally and model checked.\n\nOur evaluation, both on a simulator and an emulator on top of a real SSD, shows that TxFlash does not increase the flash firmware complexity significantly and provides transactional features with very small overheads (less than 1%), thereby making file systems easier to build. It further shows that the new cyclic commit protocol significantly outperforms traditional commit for small transactions (95% improvement in transaction throughput) and completely eliminates the space overhead due to commit records.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Sungkyunkwan University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Sungkyunkwan University", "Sungkyunkwan University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Reutlingen University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science", "Fusion-io", "Fusion-io"], "authors": ["Vijayan Prabhakaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakaran:Vijayan", "Thomas L.
