For  r  =  o ( n /log n  \u00b7 loglog n ), this improves over the \u03a9( n  2 / r  \u00b7 log( n / r )) bound that is known for many explicit matrices.   Our result implies that the explicit trilinear [ n ]\u00d7 [ n ] \u00d7 [2 n ] function defined by  F ( x , y , z ) = \u2211  i , j   x   i    y   j    z   i + j   has complexity \u03a9( n  3/5 ) in the multilinear circuit model suggested by Goldreich and Wigderson (ECCC, 2013), which yields an exp( n  3/5 ) lower bound on the size of the so-called  canonical  depth-three circuits for  F . We also prove that  F  has complexity \u03a9( n  2/3 ) if the multilinear circuits are further restricted to be of depth 2.   In addition, we show that a matrix whose entries are sampled from a 2 \u2212 n  -biased distribution has complexity \u03a9( n  2/3 ), regardless of depth restrictions, almost matching the known  O ( n  2/3 ) upper bound for any matrix. We turn this randomized construction into an explicit 4-linear construction with similar lower bounds, using the quadratic small-biased construction of Mossel et al.
