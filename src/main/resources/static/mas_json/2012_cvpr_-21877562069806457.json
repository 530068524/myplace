{"title": "Pedestrian detection at 100 frames per second.", "fields": ["pedestrian detection", "object detection", "frame rate", "graphics processing unit", "monocular"], "abstract": "We present a new pedestrian detector that improves both in speed and quality over state-of-the-art. By efficiently handling different scales and transferring computation from test time to training time, detection speed is improved. When processing monocular images, our system provides high quality detections at 50 fps. We also propose a new method for exploiting geometric context extracted from stereo images. On a single CPU+GPU desktop machine, we reach 135 fps, when processing street scenes, from rectified input to detections output.", "citation": "Citations (554)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Rodrigo Benenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benenson:Rodrigo", "Markus Mathias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathias:Markus", "Radu Timofte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Timofte:Radu", "Luc J.
