{"title": "Extending BM25 with multiple query operators.", "fields": ["okapi bm25", "ranking", "query expansion", "weighting"], "abstract": "Traditional probabilistic relevance frameworks for informational retrieval refrain from taking positional information into account, due to the hurdles of developing a sound model while avoiding an explosion in the number of parameters. Nonetheless, the well-known BM25F extension of the successful Okapi ranking function can be seen as an embryonic attempt in that direction. In this paper, we proceed along the same line, defining the notion of  virtual region : a virtual region is a part of the document that, like a BM25F-field, can provide a (larger or smaller, depending on a tunable weighting parameter) evidence of relevance of the document; differently from BM25F fields, though, virtual regions are generated implicitly by applying suitable (usually, but not necessarily, positional-aware) operators to the query. This technique fits nicely in the eliteness model behind BM25 and provides a principled explanation to BM25F; it specializes to BM25(F) for some trivial operators, but has a much more general appeal. Our experiments (both on standard collections, such as TREC, and on Web-like repertoires) show that the use of virtual regions is beneficial for retrieval effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... , Milano, Italy"], "authors": ["Roi Blanco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanco:Roi", "Paolo Boldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boldi:Paolo"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
