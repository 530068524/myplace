We then present a comparative analysis of the vanilla memory management scheme of Memcached and our approach, using real traces from a major content delivery network operator. Our results indicate that our scheme achieves near-optimal performance, striking a good balance between the performance perceived by end-users and the pressure imposed on back-end servers.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Verona", "Institut Eur\u00e9com"], "authors": ["Damiano Carra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carra:Damiano", "Pietro Michiardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michiardi:Pietro"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
