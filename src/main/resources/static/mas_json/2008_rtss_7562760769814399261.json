{"title": "The Rationale for Time-Triggered Ethernet.", "fields": ["carrier ethernet", "ieee 802 1q", "connection oriented ethernet", "fiber distributed data interface", "ethernet over sdh"], "abstract": "Time-triggered (TT) Ethernet is a new real-time communication protocol that is fully compatible with Ethernet and provides in addition to the standard Ethernet service a deterministic real-time communication service for distributed real-time systems. This paper elaborates on basic concepts in real-time communication, elicits real-time communication requirements and discusses some innate conflicts that must be considered in any realtime protocol design. In the second part, the rationale and the principles of operation of TT-Ethernet are presented and common properties of all members of the TT-Ethernet protocol family are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Hermann Kopetz, ... v.
