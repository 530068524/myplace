This flow is computed by solving a sequence of electrical flow problems. Each electrical flow is given by the solution of a system of linear equations in a Laplacian matrix, and thus may be approximately computed in nearly-linear time. Using this approach, we develop the fastest known algorithm for computing approximately maximum s-t flows. For a graph having n vertices and m edges, our algorithm computes a (1-e)-approximately maximum s-t flow in time ~O(mn 1/3 e -11/3 ). A dual version of our approach gives the fastest known algorithm for computing a (1+e)-approximately minimum s-t cut. It takes ~O(m+n 4/3 e -16/3 ) time. Previously, the best dependence on m and n was achieved by the algorithm of Goldberg and Rao (J. ACM 1998), which can be used to compute approximately maximum s-t flows in time ~O({m\u221ane -1 ), and approximately minimum s-t cuts in time ~O(m+n 3/2 e -3 ).", "citation": "Citations (214)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Yale University", "USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Paul Christiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christiano:Paul", "Jonathan A.
