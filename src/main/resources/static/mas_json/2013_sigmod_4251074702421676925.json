Determining similarity using tree edit distance has been proven useful in a variety of application areas. While subtree similarity-search has been studied in the past, solutions required traversal of all of  T , which poses a severe bottleneck in processing time, as  T  grows larger. This paper proposes the first index structure for subtree similarity-search, provided that the unit cost function is used. Extensive experimentation and comparison to previous work shows the huge improvement gained when using the proposed index structure and processing algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sara Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Sara"], "pages": 12}
