Moreover, we prove that this holds also for the cut polytope and the stable set polytope. These results were discovered through a new connection that we make between one-way quantum communication protocols and semidefinite programming reformulations of LPs.", "citation": "Citations (197)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "University of Amsterdam", "Friedrich-Alexa ... langen, Germany"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Samuel Fiorini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiorini:Samuel", "Serge Massar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massar:Serge", "Sebastian Pokutta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pokutta:Sebastian", "Hans Raj Tiwary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwary:Hans_Raj", "Ronald de Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Ronald_de"], "pages": 12}
