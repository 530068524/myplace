{"title": "The Intersection of Two Halfspaces Has High Threshold Degree.", "fields": ["conjecture", "combinatorics", "open problem", "rational function", "discrete mathematics", "boolean function", "exponential function", "mathematics", "binary logarithm", "perceptron"], "abstract": "The threshold degree of a Boolean function f:{0,1}^n-\u226b{-1,+1} is the least degree of a real polynomial p such f(x)=sgn p(x). We construct two halfspaces on {0,1}^n whose intersection has threshold degree Theta(sqrt n), an exponential improvement on previous lower bounds. This solves an open problem due to Klivans (2002) and rules out the use of perceptron-based techniques for PAC learning the intersection of two halfspaces, a central unresolved challenge in computational learning. We also prove that the intersection of two majority functions has threshold degree Omega(log n), which is tight and settles a conjecture of O'Donnell and Servedio (2003).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Alexander A.
