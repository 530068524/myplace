The proposed method augments the state-of-the-art bilinear compatibility model by incorporating latent variables. Instead of learning a single bilinear map, it learns a collection of maps with the selection, of which map to use, being a latent variable for the current image-class pair. We train the model with a ranking based objective function which penalizes incorrect rankings of the true class for a given image. We empirically demonstrate that our model improves the state-of-the-art for various class embeddings consistently on three challenging publicly available datasets for the zero-shot setting. Moreover, our method leads to visually highly interpretable results with clear clusters of different fine-grained object properties that correspond to different latent variable maps.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yongqin Xian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xian:Yongqin", "Zeynep Akata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akata:Zeynep", "Gaurav Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma_0004:Gaurav", "Quynh N.
