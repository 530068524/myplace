M obile I nsight  runs on commercial off-the-shelf phones without extra hardware or additional support from operators. It exposes protocol messages on both control plane and (below IP) data plane from the 3G/4G chipset. It provides in-device protocol analysis and operation logic inference. It further offers a simple API, through which developers and researchers obtain access to low-level network information for their mobile applications. We have built three showcases to illustrate how M obile I nsight  is applied to cellular network research.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "Ohio State University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Yuanjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanjie", "Chunyi Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Chunyi", "Zengwen Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Zengwen", "Jiayao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiayao", "Haotian Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Haotian", "Tao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Tao"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
