{"title": "Hiding Local State in Direct Style: A Higher-Order Anti-Frame Rule.", "fields": ["direct style", "soundness", "c dynamic memory allocation", "modularity", "continuation passing style"], "abstract": "Separation logic involves two dual forms of modularity: local reasoning makes part of the store invisible within a static scope, whereas hiding local state makes part of the store invisible outside a static scope. In the recent literature, both idioms are explained in terms of a higher-order frame rule. I point out that this approach to hiding local state imposes continuation-passing style, which is impractical. Instead, I introduce a higher-order anti-frame rule, which permits hiding local state in direct style. I formalize this rule in the setting of a type system, equipped with linear capabilities, for an ML-like programming language, and prove type soundness via a syntactic argument. Several applications illustrate the expressive power of the new rule.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2008", "departments": [], "conf": "lics", "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Pottier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pottier:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 10}
