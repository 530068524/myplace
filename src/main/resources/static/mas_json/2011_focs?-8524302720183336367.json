{"title": "Efficient Computation of Approximate Pure Nash Equilibria in Congestion Games.", "fields": ["epsilon equilibrium", "congestion game", "nash equilibrium", "degree", "approximation algorithm"], "abstract": "Congestion games constitute an important class of games in which computing an exact or even approximate pure Nash equilibrium is in general {\\sf PLS}-complete. We present a surprisingly simple polynomial-time algorithm that computes $O(1)$-approximate Nash equilibria in these games. In particular, for congestion games with linear latency functions, our algorithm computes $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximate pure Nash equilibria in time polynomial in the number of players, the number of resources and $1/\\epsilon$. It also applies to games with polynomial latency functions with constant maximum degree $d$; there, the approximation guarantee is $d^{O(d)}$. The algorithm essentially identifies a polynomially long sequence of best-response moves that lead to an approximate equilibrium, the existence of such short sequences is interesting in itself. These are the first positive algorithmic results for approximate equilibria in non-symmetric congestion games. We strengthen them further by proving that, for congestion games that deviate from our mild assumptions, computing $\\rho$-approximate equilibria is {\\sf PLS}-complete for any polynomial-time computable $\\rho$.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Patras", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Ioannis Caragiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caragiannis:Ioannis", "Angelo Fanelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fanelli_0001:Angelo", "Nick Gravin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gravin:Nick", "Alexander Skopalik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skopalik:Alexander"], "pages": 10}
