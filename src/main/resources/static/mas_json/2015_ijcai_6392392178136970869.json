{"title": "Open Domain Short Text Conceptualization: A Generative + Descriptive Modeling Approach.", "fields": ["conceptualization", "discriminative model", "generative grammar", "document clustering", "topic model"], "abstract": "Concepts embody the knowledge to facilitate our cognitive processes of learning. Mapping short texts to a large set of open domain concepts has gained many successful applications. In this paper, we unify the existing conceptualization methods from a Bayesian perspective, and discuss the three modeling approaches: descriptive, generative, and discriminative models. Motivated by the discussion of their advantages and shortcomings, we develop a generative + descriptive modeling approach. Our model considers term relatedness in the context, and will result in disambiguated conceptualization. We show the results of short text clustering using a news title data set and a Twitter message data set, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach compared with the state-of-the-art conceptualization and topic modeling approaches.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Zhejiang University", "Google"], "authors": ["Yangqiu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yangqiu", "Shusen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shusen", "Haixun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haixun"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
