{"title": "ICT Use by Prominent Activists in Republika Srpska.", "fields": ["politics", "social media", "data security", "outsourcing", "information sharing"], "abstract": "Bosnia-Herzegovina and its administrative unit or \"entity\", Republika Srpska are divided, transitional post-war societies. The aim of this paper is to present a preliminary analysis of regional activists' use of information and communication technology (ICT) and to identify improvement potential. Empirical investigations of social media use and qualitative interviews with the country's activists indicate strong interest in ICT. Benefits for the use of ICT by activists include more efficient access to their target group, easier information sharing with the general population, and quicker reaction to spontaneous \"offline\" activities. Simultaneously, data points to problems such as limited budgets and know-how, intensive outsourcing practices, and a significant lack of awareness regarding data security. Activists see improvement potential in areas of training on content optimization, campaign management, ICT use and maintenance, security, and privacy. Additionally, there is potential to improve upon the sustainability of activist's work and patterns related to their ICT outsourcing.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Borislav Tadic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tadic:Borislav", "Markus Rohde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rohde:Markus", "Volker Wulf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulf:Volker", "David Randall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Randall:David"], "pages": 14}
