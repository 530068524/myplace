{"title": "WebRanz: web page randomization for better advertisement delivery and web-bot prevention.", "fields": ["client side scripting", "web accessibility initiative", "web development", "web design", "html element"], "abstract": "Nowadays, a rapidly increasing number of web users are using Ad-blockers to block online advertisements. Ad-blockers are browser-based software that can block most Ads on the websites, speeding up web browsers and saving bandwidth. Despite these benefits to end users, Ad-blockers could be catastrophic for the economic structure underlying the web, especially considering the rise of Ad-blocking as well as the number of technologies and services that rely exclusively on Ads to compensate their cost. In this paper, we introduce WebRanz that utilizes a randomization mechanism to circumvent Ad-blocking. Using WebRanz, content publishers can constantly mutate the internal HTML elements and element attributes of their web pages, without affecting their visual appearances and functionalities. Randomization invalidates the pre-defined patterns that Ad-blockers use to filter out Ads. Though the design of WebRanz is motivated by evading Ad-blockers, WebRanz also benefits the defense against bot scripts. We evaluate the effectiveness of WebRanz and its overhead using 221 randomly sampled top Alexa web pages and 8 representative bot scripts.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "IBM", "Pennsylvania State University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Weihang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Weihang", "Yunhui Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yunhui", "Xinyu Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Xinyu", "Yonghwi Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Yonghwi", "Xiangyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Xiangyu", "Patrick Th.
