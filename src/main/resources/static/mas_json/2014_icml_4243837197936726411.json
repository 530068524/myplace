Rectangular partitioning is used in relational data analysis, and is classified into three types: regular grid, hierarchical, and arbitrary. Conventionally, a variety of probabilistic models have been advanced for the first two, including the product of Chinese restaurant processes and the Mondrian process. However, existing models for arbitrary partitioning are too complicated to permit the analysis of the statistical behaviors of models, which places very severe capability limits on relational data analysis. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic model of arbitrary partitioning called the rectangular tiling process (RTP). Our model has a sound mathematical base in projective systems and infinite extension of conditional probabilities, and is capable of representing partitions of infinite elements as found in ordinary Bayesian nonparametric models.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["NTT communicati ... i-shi, Kanagawa", "NTT communicati ... i-shi, Kanagawa", "NTT communicati ... i-shi, Kanagawa", "NTT communicati ... i-shi, Kanagawa", "NTT communicati ... i-shi, Kanagawa"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Masahiro Nakano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakano:Masahiro", "Katsuhiko Ishiguro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishiguro:Katsuhiko", "Akisato Kimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimura:Akisato", "Takeshi Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Takeshi", "Naonori Ueda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ueda:Naonori"], "pages": 9}
