{"title": "Hyperloop: group-based NIC-offloading to accelerate replicated transactions in multi-tenant storage systems.", "fields": ["data availability", "hyperloop", "root cause", "central processing unit", "remote direct memory access"], "abstract": "Storage systems in data centers are an important component of large-scale online services. They typically perform replicated transactional operations for high data availability and integrity. Today, however, such operations suffer from high tail latency even with recent kernel bypass and storage optimizations, and thus affect the predictability of end-to-end performance of these services. We observe that the root cause of the problem is the involvement of the CPU, a precious commodity in multi-tenant settings, in the critical path of replicated transactions. In this paper, we present HyperLoop, a new framework that removes CPU from the critical path of replicated transactions in storage systems by offloading them to commodity RDMA NICs, with non-volatile memory as the storage medium. To achieve this, we develop new and general NIC offloading primitives that can perform memory operations on all nodes in a replication group while guaranteeing ACID properties without CPU involvement. We demonstrate that popular storage applications can be easily optimized using our primitives. Our evaluation results with microbenchmarks and application benchmarks show that HyperLoop can reduce 99  th   percentile latency \u2248 800X with close to 0% CPU consumption on replicas.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, San Diego", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Daehyeok Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Daehyeok", "Amirsaman Memaripour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Memaripour:Amirsaman", "Anirudh Badam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badam:Anirudh", "Yibo Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yibo", "Hongqiang Harry Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hongqiang_Harry", "Jitu Padhye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padhye:Jitu", "Shachar Raindel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raindel:Shachar", "Steven Swanson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swanson:Steven", "Vyas Sekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sekar:Vyas", "Srinivasan Seshan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seshan:Srinivasan"], "pages": 16}
