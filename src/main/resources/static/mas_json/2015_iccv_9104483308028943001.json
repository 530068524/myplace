One powerful approach for generating region proposals is based on minimizing parametric energy functions with parametric maxflow. In this paper, we introduce Parametric Min-Loss (PML), a novel structured learning framework for parametric energy functions. While PML is generally applicable to different domains, we use it in the context of region proposals to learn to combine a set of mid-level grouping cues to yield a small set of object region proposals with high recall. Our learning framework accounts for multiple diverse outputs, and is complemented by diversification seeds based on image location and color. This approach casts perceptual grouping and cue combination in a novel structured learning framework which yields baseline improvements on VOC 2012 and COCO 2014.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Tom Sie Ho Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Tom_Sie_Ho", "Sanja Fidler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fidler:Sanja", "Sven J.
