Through a 3-month study of 161 deliberations over whether a news item should appear on Wikipedia's front page, we demonstrate that elite users fulfill a unique gatekeeping role that permits them to leverage their community position to block the promotion of inappropriate items. However, these elite users are unable to promote their supported news items more effectively than other types of editors. These findings suggest that \"one-sided gatekeeping\" may reflect a crucial stasis in social media where the community has to balance the experience of its elite users while encouraging contributions from non-elite users.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Brian Keegan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keegan:Brian", "Darren Gergle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gergle:Darren"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
