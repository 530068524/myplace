{"title": "Discovering Long Range Properties of Social Networks with Multi-Valued Time-Inhomogeneous Models.", "fields": ["data set", "exponential family", "machine learning", "dynamic network analysis", "social network"], "abstract": "The current methods used to mine and analyze temporal social network data make two assumptions: all edges have the same strength, and all parameters are time-homogeneous. We show that those assumptions may not hold for social networks and propose an alternative model with two novel aspects: (1) the modeling of edges as multi-valued variables that can change in intensity, and (2) the use of a curved exponential family framework to capture time-inhomogeneous properties while retaining a parsimonious and interpretable model. We show that our model outperforms traditional models on two real-world social network data sets.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Dartmouth College", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Danny Wyatt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wyatt:Danny", "Tanzeem Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Tanzeem", "Jeff A.
