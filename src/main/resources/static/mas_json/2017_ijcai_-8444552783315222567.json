It is urgent to achieve goals of misinformation identification and early detection in social media. In dynamic and complicated social media scenarios, some conventional methods mainly concentrate on feature engineering which fail to cover potential features in new scenarios and have difficulty in shaping elaborate high-level interactions among significant features. Moreover, a recent Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based method suffers from deficiencies that it is not qualified for practical early detection of misinformation and poses a bias to the latest input. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Convolutional Approach for Misinformation Identification (CAMI) based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CAMI can flexibly extract key features scattered among an input sequence and shape high-level interactions among significant features, which help effectively identify misinformation and achieve practical early detection. Experiment results on two large-scale datasets validate the effectiveness of CAMI model on both misinformation identification and early detection tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Center for Excellence in Education", "Center for Excellence in Education", "Center for Rese ... rn Recognition"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Feng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Feng", "Qiang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0006:Qiang", "Shu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Shu", "Liang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Liang", "Tieniu Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Tieniu"], "pages": 7}
