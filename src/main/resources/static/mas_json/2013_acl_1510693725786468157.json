However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jiajun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jiajun", "Chengqing Zong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zong:Chengqing"], "pages": 10}
