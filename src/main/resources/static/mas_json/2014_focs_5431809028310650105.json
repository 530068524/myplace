{"title": "Local Tests of Global Entanglement and a Counterexample to the Generalized Area Law.", "fields": ["no communication theorem", "entanglement witness", "squashed entanglement", "one way quantum computer", "multipartite entanglement"], "abstract": "We introduce a technique for applying quantum expanders in a distributed fashion, and use it to solve two basic questions: testing whether a bipartite quantum state shared by two parties is the maximally entangled state and disproving a generalized area law. In the process these two questions which appear completely unrelated turn out to be two sides of the same coin. Strikingly in both cases a constant amount of resources are used to verify a global property.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "Slovak Acad. of ... slava, Slovakia", "Slovak Acad. of ... slava, Slovakia"], "authors": ["Dorit Aharonov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aharonov:Dorit", "Aram Wettroth Harrow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrow:Aram_Wettroth", "Zeph Landau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Landau:Zeph", "Daniel Nagaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagaj:Daniel", "Mario Szegedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szegedy:Mario", "Umesh V.
