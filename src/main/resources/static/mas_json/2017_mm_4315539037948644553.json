This paper addresses the problem integrating the cross-OSN information to facilitate an immersive social media search experience. We exploit hashtag, which is widely used to annotate and organize multi-modal items in different OSNs, as the bridge for information aggregation and organization. A three-stage solution framework is proposed for hashtag representation, clustering and demonstration. Given an event query, the related items from three OSNs, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube, are organized in cluster-hashtag-item hierarchy for display. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated by qualitative and quantitative experiments on hundreds of trending event queries.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nanjing University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Yuqi Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yuqi", "Jitao Sang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sang:Jitao", "Tongwei Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Tongwei", "Changsheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Changsheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
