Specifically, in information-theoretic, k-server PIR protocols the database is replicated among k servers, and each server learns nothing about the item the user retrieves. The cost of such protocols is measured by the communication complexity of retrieving one out of n bits of data. For any fixed k, the complexity of the best protocols prior to our work was O(n/sup 1/2k-1/). Since then several methods were developed in an attempt to beat this bound, but all these methods yielded the same asymptotic bound. In this paper, this barrier is finally broken and the complexity of information-theoretic k-server PIR is improved to n/sup O(log log k/k log k)/. The new PIR protocols can also be used to construct k-query binary locally decodable codes of length exp(n/sup O(log log k/k log k)/), compared to exp(n/sup 1/k-1/) in previous constructions. The improvements presented in this paper apply even for small values of k: the PIR protocols are more efficient than previous ones for every k/spl ges/3, and the locally decodable codes are shorter for every k/spl ges/4.", "citation": "Citations (237)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Victoria", "University of New Mexico", "University of California, Berkeley", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "University of Victoria", "University of New Mexico", "Dipartimento di ... me Univ., Italy", "Inst.
