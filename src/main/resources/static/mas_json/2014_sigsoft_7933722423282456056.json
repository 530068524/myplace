{"title": "Apposcopy: semantics-based detection of Android malware through static analysis.", "fields": ["cryptovirology", "user information", "blossom algorithm", "taint checking", "call graph"], "abstract": "We present Apposcopy, a new semantics-based approach for identifying a prevalent class of Android malware that steals private user information. Apposcopy incorporates (i) a high-level language for specifying signatures that describe semantic characteristics of malware families and (ii) a static analysis for deciding if a given application matches a malware signature. The signature matching algorithm of Apposcopy uses a combination of static taint analysis and a new form of program representation called Inter-Component Call Graph to efficiently detect Android applications that have certain control- and data-flow properties. We have evaluated Apposcopy on a corpus of real-world Android applications and show that it can effectively and reliably pinpoint malicious applications that belong to certain malware families.", "citation": "Citations (230)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Stanford University", "University of Texas at Austin", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Yu Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Yu", "Saswat Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Saswat", "Isil Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Isil", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
