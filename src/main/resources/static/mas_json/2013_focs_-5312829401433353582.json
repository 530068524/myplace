{"title": "The Parity of Directed Hamiltonian Cycles.", "fields": ["hamiltonian path problem", "foster graph", "hopcroft karp algorithm", "pancyclic graph", "pseudoforest"], "abstract": "We present a deterministic algorithm that given any directed graph on n vertices computes the parity of its number of Hamiltonian cycles in O(1.619n) time and polynomial space. For bipartite graphs, we give a 1.5npoly(n) expected time algorithm. Our algorithms are based on a new combinatorial formula for the number of Hamiltonian cycles modulo a positive integer.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Lund University", "Lund University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Andreas Bj\u00f6rklund.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bj=ouml=rklund:Andreas", "Thore Husfeldt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Husfeldt:Thore"], "pages": 9}
