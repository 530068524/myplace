{"title": "Commitment Semantics for Sequential Decision Making under Reward Uncertainty.", "fields": ["bayesian probability", "machine learning", "probabilistic logic", "semantics", "computation", "artificial intelligence", "computer science"], "abstract": "Cooperating agents can make commitments to help each other, but commitments might have to be probabilistic when actions have stochastic outcomes. We consider the additional complication in cases where an agent might prefer to change its policy as it learns more about its reward function from experience. How should such an agent be allowed to change its policy while still faithfully pursuing its commitment in a principled decision-theoretic manner? We address this question by defining a class of Dec-POMDPs with Bayesian reward uncertainty, and by developing a novel Commitment Constrained Iterative Mean Reward algorithm that implements the semantics of faithful commitment pursuit while still permitting the agent's response to the evolving understanding of its rewards. We bound the performance of our algorithm theoretically, and evaluate empirically how it effectively balances solution quality and computation cost.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Quora, Inc.", "Nissan Research Center", "Electrical Engi ... and Engineering", "Electrical Engi ... and Engineering"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Qi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qi", "Edmund H.
