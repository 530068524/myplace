Prior work in agent modeling has largely been task-specific and driven by hand-engineering domain-specific prior knowledge. We propose a general learning framework for modeling agent behavior in any multiagent system using only a handful of interaction data. Our framework casts agent modeling as a representation learning problem. Consequently, we construct a novel objective inspired by imitation learning and agent identification and design an algorithm for unsupervised learning of representations of agent policies. We demonstrate empirically the utility of the proposed framework in (i) a challenging high-dimensional competitive environment for continuous control and (ii) a cooperative environment for communication, on supervised predictive tasks, unsupervised clustering, and policy optimization using deep reinforcement learning.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Stanford University", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Aditya Grover.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grover:Aditya", "Maruan Al-Shedivat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Al=Shedivat:Maruan", "Jayesh K.
