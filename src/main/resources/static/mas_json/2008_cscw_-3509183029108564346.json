{"title": "Resilience in collaboration: technology as a resource for new patterns of action.", "fields": ["psychological resilience", "structural change", "computer supported cooperative work", "working group", "socialization"], "abstract": "In CSCW, there has been little or no attention given to how people use technology to restore collaborations when there is a major environmental disruption. We are especially interested in studying resilience in collaboration-the extent to which people continue to collaborate with work groups or to socialize despite prolonged disruption. We conducted an empirical study of people living in two countries that experienced prolonged disruption through war in their work and personal lives. We describe how technology played a major role in providing people with alternative resources to reconstruct, modify, and develop new routines, or patterns of action, for work and socializing. People created new assemblages of technological and physical resources. We discuss how the use of new resources in creating new routines led to more of a reliance on virtual work and in some cases to deeper structural changes.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Gloria Mark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mark:Gloria", "Bryan C.
