This paper provides a novel theoretical bound on 3D reconstruction error, arguing that the existing definition of reconstructability is fundamentally flawed in that it fails to consider system condition. This insight motivates a novel strategy whereby the trajectory's response to a set of high-pass filters is minimised. The new approach eliminates the need to tune the basis size and is more efficient for long sequences. Additionally, the truncated DCT basis is shown to have a dual interpretation as a high-pass filter. The success of trajectory filter reconstruction is demonstrated quantitatively on synthetic projections of real motion capture sequences and qualitatively on real image sequences.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jack Valmadre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valmadre:Jack", "Simon Lucey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucey:Simon"], "pages": 8}
