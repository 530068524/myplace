In this paper, we show how to automatically construct such proofs for probabilistic programs. First, we present f-coupled postconditions, an abstraction describing two correlated program executions. Second, we show how properties of f-coupled postconditions can imply various probabilistic properties of the original programs. Third, we demonstrate how to reduce the proof-search problem to a purely logical synthesis problem of the form Open image in new window , making probabilistic reasoning unnecessary. We develop a prototype implementation to automatically build coupling proofs for probabilistic properties, including uniformity and independence of program expressions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University College London", "Cornell University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Aws Albarghouthi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albarghouthi:Aws", "Justin Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Justin"], "pages": 20}
