By using MI as the registration criterion, our method is able to work in situ without the need for any specific calibration targets, which makes it practical for in-field calibration. The calibration parameters are estimated by maximizing the mutual information obtained between the sensor-measured surface intensities. We calculate the Cramer-Rao-Lower-Bound (CRLB) and show that the sample variance of the estimated parameters empirically approaches the CRLB for a sufficient number of views. Furthermore, we compare the calibration results to independent ground-truth and observe that the mean error also empirically approaches to zero as the number of views are increased. This indicates that the proposed algorithm, in the limiting case, calculates a minimum variance unbiased (MVUB) estimate of the calibration parameters. Experimental results are presented for data collected by a vehicle mounted with a 3D laser scanner and an omnidirectional camera system.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Ford Motor Company", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Gaurav Pandey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandey:Gaurav", "James R.
