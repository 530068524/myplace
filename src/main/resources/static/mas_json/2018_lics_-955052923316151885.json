{"title": "A van Benthem Theorem for Fuzzy Modal Logic.", "fields": ["predicate logic", "modal logic", "modal", "bisimulation", "description logic"], "abstract": "We present a fuzzy (or quantitative) version of the van Benthem theorem, which characterizes propositional modal logic as the bisimulation-invariant fragment of first-order logic. Specifically, we consider a first-order fuzzy predicate logic along with its modal fragment, and show that the fuzzy first-order formulas that are non-expansive w.r.t. the natural notion of bisimulation distance are exactly those that can be approximated by fuzzy modal formulas.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "Australian National University", "Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen"], "authors": ["Paul Wild.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wild:Paul", "Lutz Schr\u00f6der.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schr=ouml=der:Lutz", "Dirk Pattinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pattinson:Dirk", "Barbara K\u00f6nig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=nig_0001:Barbara"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
