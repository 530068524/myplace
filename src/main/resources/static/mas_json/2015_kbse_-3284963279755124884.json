{"title": "Synthesising Interprocedural Bit-Precise Termination Proofs (T).", "fields": ["mathematical proof", "abstract interpretation", "termination analysis", "software bug", "ranking"], "abstract": "Proving program termination is key to guaranteeing absence of undesirable behaviour, such as hanging programs and even security vulnerabilities such as denial-of-service attacks. To make termination checks scale to large systems, interprocedural termination analysis seems essential, which is a largely unexplored area of research in termination analysis, where most effort has focussed on difficult single-procedure problems. We present a modular termination analysis for C programs using template-based interprocedural summarisation. Our analysis combines a context-sensitive, over-approximating forward analysis with the inference of under-approximating preconditions for termination. Bit-precise termination arguments are synthesised over lexicographic linear ranking function templates. Our experimental results show that our tool 2LS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, and demonstrate the clear advantage of interprocedural reasoning over monolithic analysis in terms of efficiency, while retaining comparable precision.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Hong-Yi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hong=Yi", "Cristina David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/David:Cristina", "Daniel Kroening.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kroening:Daniel", "Peter Schrammel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schrammel:Peter", "Bj\u00f6rn Wachter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wachter:Bj=ouml=rn"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
