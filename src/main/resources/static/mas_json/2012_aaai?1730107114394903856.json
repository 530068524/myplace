One way of dealing with symmetry is to add constraints that eliminate symmetric solutions. We survey recent results in this area, focusing especially on two common and useful cases: symmetry breaking constraints for row and column symmetry, and symmetry breaking constraints for eliminating value symmetry.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["NICTA"], "authors": ["Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
