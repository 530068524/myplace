{"title": "Spectral Sparsification and Regret Minimization Beyond Matrix Multiplicative Updates.", "fields": ["minification", "multiplicative function", "regularization", "novelty", "regret"], "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a novel construction of the linear-sized spectral sparsifiers of Batson, Spielman and Srivastava [11]. While previous constructions required \u03a9(n 4 ) running time [11, 45], our sparsification routine can be implemented in almost-quadratic running time O(n 2+e ). The fundamental conceptual novelty of our work is the leveraging of a strong connection between sparsification and a regret minimization problem over density matrices. This connection was known to provide an interpretation of the randomized sparsifiers of Spielman and Srivastava [39] via the application of matrix multiplicative weight updates (MWU) [17, 43]. In this paper, we explain how matrix MWU naturally arises as an instance of the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework and generalize this approach to yield a larger class of updates. This new class allows us to accelerate the construction of linear-sized spectral sparsifiers, and give novel insights on the motivation behind Batson, Spielman and Srivastava [11].", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Boston University", "Boston University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Zeyuan Allen Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Zeyuan_Allen", "Zhenyu Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Zhenyu", "Lorenzo Orecchia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orecchia:Lorenzo"], "pages": 9}
