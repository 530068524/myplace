Relational learning algorithms learn the definition of a new relation in terms of existing relations in the database. Nevertheless, the same database may be represented under different schemas for various reasons, such as data quality, efficiency and usability. The output of current relational learning algorithms tends to vary quite substantially over the choice of schema. This variation complicates their off-the-shelf application. We introduce and formalize the property of schema independence of relational learning algorithms, and study both the theoretical and empirical dependence of existing algorithms on the common class of (de) composition schema transformations. We show that current algorithms are not schema independent. We propose Castor, a relational learning algorithm that achieves schema independence by leveraging data dependencies.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jose Picado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Picado:Jose", "Arash Termehchy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Termehchy:Arash", "Alan Fern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern:Alan", "Parisa Ataei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ataei:Parisa"], "pages": 16}
