Yet these results form only a part of the decision-making process and surrounding contextual information is a highly important aspect. Those who suffer from diabetes have described the daily challenges of dealing with unexpected results and a feeling of 'failure' at managing the disease. This paper describes ongoing research which focuses on using technology to assist in the capture of the contextual information to both aid the understanding of results and to potentially reduce the emotional impact of perceived 'bad' results.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Swansea University"], "authors": ["Tom Owen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Owen:Tom"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
