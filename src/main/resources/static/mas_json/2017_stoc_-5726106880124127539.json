We demonstrate several connections with matrix rigidity, communication complexity, and circuit lower bounds. The most interesting outcomes are:    The Walsh-Hadamard Transform is  Not  Very Rigid.  We give surprising  upper bounds  on the rigidity of a family of matrices whose rigidity has been extensively studied, and was conjectured to be highly rigid. For the 2  n   \ufffd  2  n   Walsh-Hadamard transform  H   n   (a.k.a. Sylvester matrices, a.k.a. the communication matrix of Inner Product modulo 2), we show how to modify only 2 I\u00b5  n   entries in each row and make the rank of  H   n   drop below 2  n (1\u00e2  I\u00a9(I\u00b5 2 /log(1/I\u00b5))) , for all small I\u00b5 > 0, over any field. That is, it is  not possible  to prove arithmetic circuit lower bounds on Hadamard matrices such as  H   n  , via L.\ufffd Valiant\u00e2  s matrix rigidity approach. We also show non-trivial rigidity upper bounds for  H   n   with smaller target rank.    Matrix Rigidity and Threshold Circuit Lower Bounds.  We give new consequences of rigid matrices for Boolean circuit complexity. First, we show that explicit  n  \ufffd   n  Boolean matrices which maintain rank at least 2 (log n ) 1\u00e2  I\ufffd   after  n  2 /2 (log n ) I\ufffd/2   modified entries (over  any  field, for any I\ufffd > 0) would yield an explicit function that does not have sub-quadratic-size  AC  0  circuits with two layers of arbitrary linear threshold gates. Second, we prove that explicit 0/1 matrices over the reals which are modestly more rigid than the best known rigidity lower bounds for  sign-rank  would imply  exponential-gate  lower bounds for the infamously difficult class of depth-two linear threshold circuits with arbitrary weights on both layers. In particular, we show that matrices defined by these seemingly-difficult circuit classes actually have low probabilistic rank and sign-rank, respectively.    An Equivalence Between Communication, Probabilistic Rank, and Rigidity.  It has been known since Razborov [1989] that explicit rigidity lower bounds would resolve longstanding lower-bound problems in communication complexity, but it seemed possible that communication lower bounds could be proved without making progress on matrix rigidity. We show that for every function  f  which is randomly self-reducible in a natural way (the inner product mod 2 is an example), bounding the communication complexity of  f  (in a precise technical sense) is  equivalent  to bounding the rigidity of the matrix of  f , via an equivalence with probabilistic rank.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Josh Alman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alman:Josh", "R.
