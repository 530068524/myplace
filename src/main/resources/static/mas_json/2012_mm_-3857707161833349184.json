{"title": "Distributional semantics with eyes: using image analysis to improve computational representations of word meaning.", "fields": ["computational semantics", "automatic image annotation", "distributional semantics", "visual word", "statistical semantics"], "abstract": "The current trend in image analysis and multimedia is to use information extracted from text and text processing techniques to help vision-related tasks, such as automated image annotation and generating semantically rich descriptions of images. In this work, we claim that image analysis techniques can \"return the favor\" to the text processing community and be successfully used for a general-purpose representation of word meaning. We provide evidence that simple low-level visual features can enrich the semantic representation of word meaning with information that cannot be extracted from text alone, leading to improvement in the core task of estimating degrees of semantic relatedness between words, as well as providing a new, perceptually-enhanced angle on word semantics. Additionally, we show how distinguishing between a concept and its context in images can improve the quality of the word meaning representations extracted from images.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento"], "authors": ["Elia Bruni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruni:Elia", "Jasper R.
