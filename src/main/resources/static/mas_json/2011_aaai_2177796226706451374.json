It is an open problem to determine if BDDs work well for a certain domain.\n\nMotivated by finding evidences for BDD growths for state space search, in this paper we are concerned with symbolic search in the domain of CONNECT FOUR. We prove that there is a variable ordering for which the set of all possible states \u2013 when continuing after a terminal state has been reached \u2013 can be represented by polynomial sized BDDs, whereas the termination criterion leads to an exponential number of nodes in the BDD given any variable ordering.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Bremen"], "authors": ["Stefan Edelkamp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edelkamp:Stefan", "Peter Kissmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kissmann:Peter"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
