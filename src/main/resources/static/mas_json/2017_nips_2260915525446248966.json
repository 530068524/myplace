{"title": "Unsupervised Learning of Disentangled and Interpretable Representations from Sequential Data.", "fields": ["prior probability", "autoencoder", "latent variable", "scenario testing", "graphical model"], "abstract": "We present a factorized hierarchical variational autoencoder, which learns disentangled and interpretable representations from sequential data without supervision. Specifically, we exploit the multi-scale nature of information in sequential data by formulating it explicitly within a factorized hierarchical graphical model that imposes sequence-dependent priors and sequence-independent priors to different sets of latent variables. The model is evaluated on two speech corpora to demonstrate, qualitatively, its ability to transform speakers or linguistic content by manipulating different sets of latent variables; and quantitatively, its ability to outperform an i-vector baseline for speaker verification and reduce the word error rate by as much as 35% in mismatched train/test scenarios for automatic speech recognition tasks.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Wei-Ning Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Wei=Ning", "Yu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0033:Yu", "James R.
