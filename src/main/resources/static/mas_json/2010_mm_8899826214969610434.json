The aim of the development is to fill in the gap between the academic and commercial utilization of image processing. The openIP libraries are interoperable, open source and easy to install. To provide fast codes, assembler optimization, OpenMP parallelization and OpenCL based GPU utilization is integrated.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Debrecen", "University of Debrecen", "University of Debrecen", "University of Debrecen"], "authors": ["Gy\u00f6rgy Kov\u00e1cs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kov=aacute=cs:Gy=ouml=rgy", "J\u00e1nos Istv\u00e1n Iv\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iv=aacute=n:J=aacute=nos_Istv=aacute=n", "\u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1nyik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=aacute=nyik:=Aacute=rp=aacute=d", "Attila Fazekas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fazekas:Attila"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
