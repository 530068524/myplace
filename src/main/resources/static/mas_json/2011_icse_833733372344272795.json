They are often composed out of visually distinctive user-interface (UI) elements that encapsulate a certain behavior - the so called UI controls. Similar controls are often used in a large number of web pages, and facilitating their reuse would offer considerable benefits. Unfortunately, because of a very short time-to-market, and a fast pace of technology development, preparing controls for reuse is usually not a primary concern. The focus of my research will be to circumvent this limitation by developing a method, and the accompanying tool for supporting web UI control reuse.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Split"], "authors": ["Josip Maras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maras:Josip"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
