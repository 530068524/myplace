{"title": "A Box-Based Distance between Regions for Guiding the Reachability Analysis of SpaceEx.", "fields": ["reachability", "theoretical computer science", "hybrid system", "data structure", "heuristics"], "abstract": "A recent technique used in falsification methods for hybrid systems relies on distance-based heuristics for guiding the search towards a goal state. The question is whether the technique can be carried over to reachability analyses that use regions as their basic data structure. In this paper, we introduce a box-based distance measure between regions. We present an algorithm that, given two regions, efficiently computes the box-based distance between them. We have implemented the algorithm in SpaceEx and use it for guiding the region-based reachability analysis of SpaceEx. We illustrate the practical potential of our approach in a case study for the navigation benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "Joseph Fourier University", "Vienna University of Technology", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Sergiy Bogomolov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogomolov:Sergiy", "Goran Frehse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frehse:Goran", "Radu Grosu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grosu:Radu", "Hamed Ladan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ladan:Hamed", "Andreas Podelski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podelski:Andreas", "Martin Wehrle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wehrle:Martin"], "pages": 16}
