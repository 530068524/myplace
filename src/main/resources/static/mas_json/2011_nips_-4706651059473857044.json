In the last two decades virtually all works have concentrated on exploiting edge information to address this problem. We take a different route by introducing a new prior on reflectance, that models reflectance values as being drawn from a sparse set of basis colors. This results in a Random Field model with global, latent variables (basis colors) and pixel-accurate output reflectance values. We show that without edge information high-quality results can be achieved, that are on par with methods exploiting this source of information. Finally, we are able to improve on state-of-the-art results by integrating edge information into our model. We believe that our new approach is an excellent starting point for future developments in this field.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "authors": ["Emin Orhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orhan:Emin", "Robert A.
