{"title": "Problems of data mobility and reuse in the provision of computer-based training for screening mammography.", "fields": ["data sharing", "reuse", "breast cancer screening", "data curation", "mammography", "data archive", "metadata"], "abstract": "This paper explores some of the problems encountered in using a data archive to build tools for training radiologists to interpret breast screening images. We detail our experiences of taking images and case notes created as part of the work of breast cancer screening and using them as resources for training. Four instances of the use of the archive in training are described in detail and the problems they reveal are discussed. We formulate some general lessons for the mobility and re-use of rich ensembles of data and artefacts drawn from complex professional settings. We argue for a richer representation of the context from which the data was taken than can be achieved through making selected relations explicit in metadata. We also conclude that facilities for correcting and elaborating data should be available at the point of use, and not separated out as distinct activities.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "University College London", "University of York", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Mark Hartswood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartswood:Mark", "Rob Procter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Procter:Rob", "Paul Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Paul", "Lilian Blot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blot:Lilian", "Stuart Anderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anderson:Stuart", "Mark Rouncefield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rouncefield:Mark", "Roger Slack.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slack:Roger"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
