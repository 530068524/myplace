Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.", "citation": "Citations (445)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong Obser ... ng Kong, China"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Xingjian Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Xingjian", "Zhourong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhourong", "Hao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0014:Hao", "Dit-Yan Yeung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeung:Dit=Yan", "Wai-Kin Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Wai=Kin", "Wang-chun Woo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woo:Wang=chun"], "pages": 9}
