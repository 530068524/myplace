Our infrastructure consists of OpenWrt-based Access Points (APs) that have been given away to residents for free to be installed as their primary wireless access mechanism. These APs are configured with our specialized measurement and monitoring software that communicates with our measurement controller through an open API. We have collected wireless performance traces from 30 homes for a period in excess of 6 months. To analyze the characteristics of these home wireless environments, we have also developed a simple metric that estimates the likely TCP throughput different clients can expect based on current channel and environmental conditions. With this infrastructure, we provide multiple quantitative observations, some of which are anecdotally understood in our community. For example, while a majority of links performed well most of the time, we observed cases of poor client experience about 2.1% of the total time.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Ashish Patro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patro:Ashish", "Srinivas Govindan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Govindan:Srinivas", "Suman Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Suman"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
