{"title": "Linking Heterogeneous Input Features with Pivots for Domain Adaptation.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "matrix decomposition", "training set", "domain adaptation", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Sentiment classification aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of user generated sentiment data (e.g., reviews, blogs). In real applications, these user generated sentiment data can span so many different domains that it is difficult to manually label training data for all of them. Hence, this paper studies the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classification where a system trained using labeled reviews from a source domain is deployed to classify sentiments of reviews in a different target domain. In this paper, we propose to link heterogeneous input features with pivots via joint non-negative matrix factorization. This is achieved by learning the domain-specific information from different domains into unified topics, with the help of pivots across all domains. We conduct experiments on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of Amazon products. Experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline method, and achieves an accuracy which is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods for sentiment classification adaptation.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Central China Normal University", "Central China Normal University", "University of Southern California", "Central China Normal University"], "authors": ["Guangyou Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guangyou", "Tingting He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Tingting", "Wensheng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wensheng", "Xiaohua Tony Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Xiaohua_Tony"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
