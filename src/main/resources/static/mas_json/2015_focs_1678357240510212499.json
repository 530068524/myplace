This problem has been extensively studied in both theory and practice, but all existing algorithms read the entire graph. In this work we design a sublinear-time algorithm for approximating the number of triangles in a graph, where the algorithm is given query access to the graph. The allowed queries are degree queries, vertex-pair queries, and neighbor queries. We show that for any given approximation parameter $0<\\epsilon<1$, the algorithm provides an estimate $\\widehat{t}$ such that, with high constant probability, $(1-\\epsilon)\\cdot t< \\widehat{t}<(1+\\epsilon)\\cdot t$, where $t$ is the number of triangles in the graph $G$. The expected query complexity of the algorithm is $(\\frac{n}{t^{1/3}} + \\min\\{m, \\frac{m^{3/2}}{t}\\})\\cdot {poly}(\\log n, \\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph and $m$ is the number of edges. The expected running time of the algorithm is $(\\frac{n}{t^{1/3}} + \\frac{m^{3/2}}{t})...", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Talya Eden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eden:Talya", "Amit Levi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levi:Amit", "Dana Ron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ron:Dana", "C.
