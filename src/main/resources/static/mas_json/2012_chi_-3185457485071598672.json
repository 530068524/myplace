An example is a personal telepresence robot, which acts as a physical proxy for a remote visitor, and uses cameras and microphones to capture its surroundings, which are transmitted back to the visitor. We propose the use of spherical displays to represent telepresent visitors at a destination. We suggest that the use of such 360 degree displays in a telepresence system has two key advantages: it is possible to understand the identity of the visitor from any viewpoint; and with suitable graphical representation, it is possible to tell where the visitor is looking from any viewpoint. In this paper, we investigate how to optimally represent a visitor as an avatar on a spherical display by evaluating how varying representations are able to accurately convey head gaze.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Oyewole Oyekoya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oyekoya:Oyewole", "William Steptoe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steptoe:William", "Anthony Steed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steed:Anthony"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
