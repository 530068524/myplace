These issues become a major algorithmic challenge in view of the dynamic nature of the wireless domain. We consider in this paper the single-transmitter power assignment problem under time-varying channels, with the objective of maximizing the data throughput. It is assumed that the transmitter has a limited power budget, to be sequentially divided during the lifetime of the battery. We deviate from the classic work in this area, which leads to explicit \"water-filling\" solutions, by considering a realistic scenario where the channel state quality changes arbitrarily from one transmission to the other. The problem is accordingly tackled within the framework of competitive analysis, which allows for worst-case performance guarantees in setups with arbitrarily varying channel conditions. We address both a \"discrete\" case, where the transmitter can transmit only at a fixed power level, and a \"continuous\" case, where the transmitter can choose any power level out of a bounded interval. For both cases, we propose online power-allocation algorithms with proven worst-case performance bounds. In addition, we establish lower bounds on the worst-case performance of any online algorithm and show that our proposed algorithms are optimal.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Open University", "IBM", "Microsoft", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "IBM", "Microsoft", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Niv Buchbinder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buchbinder:Niv", "Liane Lewin-Eytan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lewin=Eytan:Liane", "Ishai Menache.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menache:Ishai", "Joseph Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Joseph", "Ariel Orda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orda:Ariel"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
