{"title": "Generalized Rank Pooling for Activity Recognition.", "fields": ["pooling", "subspace topology", "grassmannian", "activity recognition", "manifold"], "abstract": "Most popular deep models for action recognition split video sequences into short sub-sequences consisting of a few frames, frame-based features are then pooled for recognizing the activity. Usually, this pooling step discards the temporal order of the frames, which could otherwise be used for better recognition. Towards this end, we propose a novel pooling method, generalized rank pooling (GRP), that takes as input, features from the intermediate layers of a CNN that is trained on tiny sub-sequences, and produces as output the parameters of a subspace which (i) provides a low-rank approximation to the features and (ii) preserves their temporal order. We propose to use these parameters as a compact representation for the video sequence, which is then used in a classification setup. We formulate an objective for computing this subspace as a Riemannian optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold, and propose an efficient conjugate gradient scheme for solving it. Experiments on several activity recognition datasets show that our scheme leads to state-of-the-art performance.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anoop Cherian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherian:Anoop", "Basura Fernando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fernando:Basura", "Mehrtash Harandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harandi:Mehrtash", "Stephen Gould.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gould:Stephen"], "pages": 10}
