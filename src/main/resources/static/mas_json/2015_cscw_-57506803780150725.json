In our study we examine how social practices relate to a newly developed energy management system introduced to households. We explore how design fiction can be used to identify current design limitations and to showcase future design directions to overcome these limitations. In particular, we investigated how energy consumption feedback is leaving users in a state of \"helplessness\" despite raising awareness of their environmental impact. Through participatory fictional future story-writing workshops we identified five levels of empowerment that design for sustainability practitioners can engage with. Our proposal is to use those levels of empowerment to reframe sustainable design by shifting from behaviour to social practices and from awareness to empowerment.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Austrian Institute of Technology", "Austrian Institute of Technology", "Austrian Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sebastian Prost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prost:Sebastian", "Elke E.
