A key advantage of the new formulation is that one can compute the Fisher information matrix despite varying sequence lengths and varying sampling intervals. This avoids the commonly-used ad hoc replacement of the Fisher information matrix with the identity which destroys the geometric invariance of the kernel. Our construction retains the geometric invariance, resulting in a kernel that is properly invariant under change of coordinates in the model parameter space. Experiments on detecting cognitive decline show that classifiers based on the proposed kernel out-perform those based on generative models and other feature extraction routines, and on Fisher kernels that use the identity in place of the Fisher information.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Oregon Health & Science University", "Oregon Health & Science University", "Oregon Health & Science University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zhengdong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhengdong", "Todd K.
