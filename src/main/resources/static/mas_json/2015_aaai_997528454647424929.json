A classical answer to this fundamental problem is given by the decision-theoretic value of information. Unfortunately, optimizing this objective is intractable, and myopic (greedy) approximations are known to perform poorly. In this paper, we introduce DIRECT, an efficient yet near-optimal algorithm for nonmyopically optimizing value of information. Crucially, DIRECT uses a novel surrogate objective that is: (1) aligned with the value of information problem (2) efficient to evaluate and (3) adaptive submod-ular. This latter property enables us to utilize an efficient greedy optimization while providing strong approximation guarantees. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on four diverse case-studies: touch-based robotic localization, comparison-based preference learning, wild-life conservation management, and preference elicitation in behavioral economics. In the first application, we demonstrate DIRECT in closed-loop on an actual robotic platform.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Yale University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Yuxin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yuxin", "Shervin Javdani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Javdani:Shervin", "Amin Karbasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karbasi:Amin", "J.
