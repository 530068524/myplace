{"title": "Micro Phase Shifting.", "fields": ["frequency modulation", "global illumination", "small number", "subsurface scattering", "structured light"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of shape recovery for real world scenes, where a variety of global illumination (interreflections, subsurface scattering, etc.) and illumination defocus effects are present. These effects introduce systematic and often significant errors in the recovered shape. We introduce a structured light technique called Micro Phase Shifting, which overcomes these problems. The key idea is to project sinusoidal patterns with frequencies limited to a narrow, high-frequency band. These patterns produce a set of images over which global illumination and defocus effects remain constant for each point in the scene. This enables high quality reconstructions of scenes which have traditionally been considered hard, using only a small number of images. We also derive theoretical lower bounds on the number of input images needed for phase shifting and show that Micro PS achieves the bound.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mohit Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta_0001:Mohit", "Shree K.
