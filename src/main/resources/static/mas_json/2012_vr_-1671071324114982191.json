Most previous works employ tactile devices such as vibration actuators. However, the place where the system can stimulate a user depends on the place which is covered by the devices. In addition the accuracy of user's tactile perception is low, so it is difficult to present tactile feedback at intended locations. The purpose of this study is to establish a method that represents smooth two-dimensional tactile moving strokes independent of locations of the tactile devices. Our aim is to let a user perceive that locations of vibrotactile perception are on those of visual stimuli. Thus we can present tactile feedback in larger places with higher resolution by controlling visual stimuli. In this paper we have investigated the correlation between visual stimuli and tactile perception. The results of experiments showed that visual stimuli can induce tactile illusion, which resembles the position of virtual objects.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Arinobu Niijima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niijima:Arinobu", "Takefumi Ogawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogawa:Takefumi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
