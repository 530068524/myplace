This essay is a C programmer's reaction to the call to abandon ship. It questions several aspects commonly held to define the experience of using C; these include unsafety, undefined behaviour, and the motivation of performance. It argues all these are in fact inessential; rather, it traces C's ultimate strength to a communicative design which cannot be understood within the usual conception of \"a programming language\", but can be seen as the antithesis of so-called \"managed\" languages. This communicativity is understood as facilitating the essential aspect of system-building: creating parts which interact with other remote parts---being \"alongside\" not \"within\", and of \"alien\" origin.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Cambridge"], "conf": "oopsla", "authors": ["Stephen Kell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kell:Stephen"], "pages": 17}
