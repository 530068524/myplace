The exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff strategy is a well-known technique for online learning with incomplete feedback (i.e., bandit setup). Banditron [8], a multi-class online learning algorithm for bandit setting, maximizes the run-time gain by balancing between exploration and exploitation with a fixed tradeoff parameter. The performance of Banditron can be quite sensitive to the choice of the tradeoff parameter and therefore effective algorithms to automatically tune this parameter is desirable. In this paper, we propose three learning strategies to automatically adjust the tradeoff parameter for Banditron. Our extensive empirical study with multiple real-world data sets verifies the efficacy of the proposed approach in learning the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff parameter.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "Michigan State University", "National Institutes of Health"], "authors": ["Hamed Valizadegan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valizadegan:Hamed", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Shijun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shijun"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
