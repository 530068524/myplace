{"title": "Taming MATLAB.", "fields": ["scientific language", "graph", "rapid prototyping", "matlab", "extensibility"], "abstract": "MATLAB is a dynamic scientific language used by scientists, engineers and students worldwide. Although MATLAB is very suitable for rapid prototyping and development, MATLAB users often want to convert their final MATLAB programs to a static language such as FORTRAN. This paper presents an extensible object-oriented toolkit for supporting the generation of static programs from dynamic MATLAB programs. Our open source toolkit, called the MATLAB Tamer, identifies a large tame subset of MATLAB, supports the generation of a specialized Tame IR for that subset, provides a principled approach to handling the large number of builtin MATLAB functions, and supports an extensible interprocedural value analysis for estimating MATLAB types and call graphs.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Anton Willy Dubrau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dubrau:Anton_Willy", "Laurie J.
