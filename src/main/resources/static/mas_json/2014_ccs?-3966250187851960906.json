{"title": "MACE: Detecting Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities in Web Applications.", "fields": ["privilege escalation", "secure coding", "internet security", "web application security", "web application"], "abstract": "We explore the problem of identifying unauthorized privilege escalation instances in a web application. These vulnerabilities are typically caused by missing or incorrect authorizations in the server side code of a web application. The problem of identifying these vulnerabilities is compounded by the lack of an access control policy specification in a typical web application, where the only supplied documentation is in fact its source code. This makes it challenging to infer missing checks that protect a web application's sensitive resources. To address this challenge, we develop a notion of authorization context consistency, which is satisfied when a web application consistently enforces its authorization checks across the code. We then present an approach based on program analysis to check for authorization state consistency in a web application. Our approach is implemented in a tool called MACE that uncovers vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the form of privilege escalation attacks. In particular, MACE is the first tool reported in the literature to identify a new class of web application vulnerabilities called Horizontal Privilege Escalation (HPE) vulnerabilities. MACE works on large codebases, and discovers serious, previously unknown, vulnerabilities in 5 out of 7 web applications tested. Without MACE, a comparable human-driven security audit would require weeks of effort in code inspection and testing.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "IBM", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Maliheh Monshizadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monshizadeh:Maliheh", "Prasad Naldurg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naldurg:Prasad", "V.
