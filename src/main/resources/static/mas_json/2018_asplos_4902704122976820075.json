{"title": "Skyway: Connecting Managed Heaps in Distributed Big Data Systems.", "fields": ["serialization", "byte", "cpu time", "heap", "scala"], "abstract": "Managed languages such as Java and Scala are prevalently used in development of large-scale distributed systems. Under the managed runtime, when performing data transfer across machines, a task frequently conducted in a Big Data system, the system needs to serialize a sea of objects into a byte sequence before sending them over the network. The remote node receiving the bytes then deserializes them back into objects. This process is both performance-inefficient and labor-intensive: (1) object serialization/deserialization makes heavy use of reflection, an expensive runtime operation and/or (2) serialization/deserialization functions need to be hand-written and are error-prone. This paper presents Skyway, a JVM-based technique that can directly connect managed heaps of different (local or remote) JVM processes. Under Skyway, objects in the source heap can be directly written into a remote heap without changing their formats. Skyway provides performance benefits to any JVM-based system by completely eliminating the need (1) of invoking serialization/deserialization functions, thus saving CPU time, and (2) of requiring developers to hand-write serialization functions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Khanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Khanh", "Lu Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Lu", "Christian Navasca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navasca:Christian", "Guoqing (Harry) Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Guoqing_=Harry=", "Brian Demsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demsky:Brian", "Shan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Shan"], "pages": 14}
