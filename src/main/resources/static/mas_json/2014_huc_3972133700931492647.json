Typically, it is challenging for MMA applications to implement advanced sound features (e.g., surround sound) accurately in mobile environments, especially due to unknown, irregular loudspeaker configurations. Towards an illusion that MMA applications run over specific loudspeaker configurations (i.e., speaker type, layout), this work proposes AMAC, a new  Adaptive Mobile Audio Coordination  system that senses the acoustic characteristics of mobile environments and controls individual loud-speakers adaptively and accurately. The prototype of AMAC implemented on commodity smartphones shows that it provides the coordination accuracy in sound arrival time in several tens of microseconds and reduces the variance in sound level substantially.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["KAIST", "Samsung", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Hyosu Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyosu", "Sang Jeong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sang_Jeong", "Jung-Woo Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jung=Woo", "Hwidong Bae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bae:Hwidong", "Jiyeon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jiyeon", "Junehwa Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junehwa", "Insik Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Insik"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
