At the same time, current systems have a number of fundamental limitations that inhibit more general social interactions among multiple groups of participants. In our work, we describe the development, implementation and evaluation of a domestic video conferencing system that is geared to providing true 'togetherness' among conference participants. We show that such interactions require sophisticated support for high-quality audiovisual presentation, and processing support for person identification and localisation. In this paper, we describe user requirements for effective interpersonal interaction. We then report on a system that implements these requirements. We conclude with a systems and user evaluation of this work. We present results that show that participants in a video conference can be made feel as 'together' as collocated players of a board game.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["BT Research", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "BT Research"], "authors": ["Ian Kegel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kegel:Ian", "Pablo C\u00e9sar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/C=eacute=sar:Pablo", "Jack Jansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jansen:Jack", "Dick C.
