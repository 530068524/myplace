This review selected 26 studies from the highest quality journals, conferences, and workshop in the field. The results were compiled and organized following the grounded theory approach. Results from the grounded theory were further categorized using the Ishikawa (or fishbone) diagram. The Ishikawa Diagram models all the factors potentially impacting software developers, and shows both the positive and negative impacts. Positive impacts include a reduction in the number of crises, and an increase in team communications and morale, as well as better requirements and documentation. Negative impacts include increased overhead on developers through the need to collect data and compile documentation, an undue focus on technical approaches, and the fact that SPI is oriented toward management and process quality, and not towards developers and product quality. This systematic review should support future practice through the identification of important obstacles and opportunities for achieving SPI success. Future research should also benefit from the problems and advantages of SPI identified by developers.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Mathieu Lavall\u00e9e.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lavall=eacute=e:Mathieu", "Pierre N.
