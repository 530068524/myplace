NRM takes the general encoder-decoder framework: it formalizes the generation of response as a decoding process based on the latent representation of the input text, while both encoding and decoding are realized with recurrent neural networks (RNN). The NRM is trained with a large amount of one-round conversation data collected from a microblogging service. Empirical study shows that NRM can generate grammatically correct and content-wise appropriate responses to over 75% of the input text, outperforming state-of-the-arts in the same setting, including retrieval-based and SMT-based models.", "citation": "Citations (355)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Lifeng Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Lifeng", "Zhengdong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhengdong", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Hang"], "pages": 10}
