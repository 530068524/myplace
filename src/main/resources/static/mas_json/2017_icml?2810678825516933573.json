{"title": "Video Pixel Networks.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "ground truth", "joint probability distribution", "mnist database", "video tracking"], "abstract": "We propose a probabilistic video model, the Video Pixel Network (VPN), that estimates the discrete joint distribution of the raw pixel values in a video. The model and the neural architecture reflect the time, space and color structure of video tensors and encode it as a four-dimensional dependency chain. The VPN approaches the best possible performance on the Moving MNIST benchmark, a leap over the previous state of the art, and the generated videos show only minor deviations from the ground truth. The VPN also produces detailed samples on the action-conditional Robotic Pushing benchmark and generalizes to the motion of novel objects.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "Ghent University", "University of Oxford", "Google", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Nal Kalchbrenner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalchbrenner:Nal", "A\u00e4ron van den Oord.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oord:A=auml=ron_van_den", "Karen Simonyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simonyan:Karen", "Ivo Danihelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danihelka:Ivo", "Oriol Vinyals.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vinyals:Oriol", "Alex Graves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graves:Alex", "Koray Kavukcuoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kavukcuoglu:Koray"], "pages": 9}
