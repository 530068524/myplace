{"title": "A Unified Programming Model for Intra- and Inter-Node Offloading on Xeon Phi Clusters.", "fields": ["large segment offload", "coprocessor", "xeon", "cuda", "xeon phi"], "abstract": "Standard offload programming models for the Xeon Phi, e.g. Intel LEO and OpenMP 4.0, are restricted to a single compute node and hence a limited number of coprocessors. Scaling applications across a Xeon Phi cluster/supercomputer thus requires hybrid programming approaches, usually MPI+X. In this work, we present a framework based on heterogeneous active messages (HAM-Offload) that provides the means to offload work to local and remote (co)processors using a unified offload API. Since HAM-Offload provides similar primitives as current local offload frameworks, existing applications can be easily ported to overcome the single-node limitation while keeping the convenient offload programming model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework by using it to enable a real-world application from the field of molecular dynamics to use multiple local and remote Xeon Phis. The evaluation shows good scaling behavior. Compared with LEO, performance is equal for large offloads and significantly better for small offloads.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Zuse Institute Berlin", "Zuse Institute Berlin", "Zuse Institute Berlin", "GETLIG & TAR GbR, Falkensee"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Matthias Noack.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noack:Matthias", "Florian Wende.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wende:Florian", "Thomas Steinke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinke:Thomas", "Frank Cordes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cordes:Frank"], "pages": 12}
