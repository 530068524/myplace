{"title": "Cohort Analysis with Ease.", "fields": ["computer science", "data mining", "cohort study", "operability", "use case"], "abstract": "The tremendous volume of user behavior records generated in various domains provides data analysts new opportunities to mine valuable insights into user behavior. Cohort analysis, which aims to find user behavioral trends hidden in time series, is one of the most commonly used techniques. Since traditional database systems suffer from both operability and efficiency when processing cohort analysis queries, we proposed COHANA, a query processing system specialized for cohort analysis. In order to make COHANA easy-to-use, we present a comprehensive and powerful tool in this demo, covering the major use cases in cohort analysis with intuitive and accessible operations. Analysts can easily adapt COHANA to their own use with provided visualizations which can help verify their analysis assumptions and inconspicuous trends hidden in user behavior data.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Shentilium Priv ... pore, Singapore", "Shentilium Priv ... pore, Singapore"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Zhongle Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Zhongle", "Qingchao Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Qingchao", "Fei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Fei", "Gene Yan Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Gene_Yan", "Weilong Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Weilong", "Beng Chin Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Beng_Chin"], "pages": 4}
