The DC-IGN model is composed of multiple layers of convolution and de-convolution operators and is trained using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) algorithm [10]. We propose a training procedure to encourage neurons in the graphics code layer to represent a specific transformation (e.g. pose or light). Given a single input image, our model can generate new images of the same object with variations in pose and lighting. We present qualitative and quantitative tests of the model's efficacy at learning a 3D rendering engine for varied object classes including faces and chairs.", "citation": "Citations (344)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tejas D.
