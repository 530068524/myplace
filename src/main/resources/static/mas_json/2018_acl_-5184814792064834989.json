{"title": "AMR dependency parsing with a typed semantic algebra.", "fields": ["graph", "machine learning", "decoding methods", "dependency grammar", "parsing"], "abstract": "We present a semantic parser for Abstract Meaning Representations which learns to parse strings into tree representations of the compositional structure of an AMR graph. This allows us to use standard neural techniques for supertagging and dependency tree parsing, constrained by a linguistically principled type system. We present two approximative decoding algorithms, which achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and outperform strong baselines.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Potsdam", "Macquarie University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mark Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Mark", "Alexander Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Alexander", "Jonas Groschwitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Groschwitz:Jonas", "Meaghan Fowlie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fowlie:Meaghan", "Matthias Lindemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindemann:Matthias"], "pages": 11}
