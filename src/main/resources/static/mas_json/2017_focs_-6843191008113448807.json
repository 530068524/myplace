We give a deterministic algorithm which, given an n-variable \\poly(n)-clause CNF formula F that has at least \u2265 2^n satisfying assignments, runs in time \\[ n^{\\tilde{O}(\\log\\log n)^2} \\] for \u2265 \\ge 1/\\polylog(n) and outputs a satisfying assignment of F. Prior to our work the fastest known algorithm for this problem was simply to enumerate over all seeds of a pseudorandom generator for CNFs; using the best known PRGs for CNFs \\cite{DETT10, this takes time n^{\\tilde{\u03a9}(\\log n)} even for constant \u2265. Our approach is based on a new general framework relating deterministic search and deterministic approximate counting, which we believe may find further applications.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "authors": ["Rocco A.
