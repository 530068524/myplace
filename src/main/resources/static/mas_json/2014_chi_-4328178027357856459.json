Our work builds on this. We present results from an exploratory qualitative study on the family communication practices of family members who communicate both within and between rural, suburban, and urban settings in Kenya. Our findings reveal that family communication focuses on economic support, well-being, life advice, and everyday coordination of activities. We also outline social factors that affect family communication, including being an eldest child, having a widowed sibling, and having reduced access to technology because of gender, literacy, or one's financial situation. Lastly, we discuss new opportunities for technology design and articulate the challenges that designers will face if creating or deploying family communication technologies in Kenya.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Google", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Erick Oduor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oduor:Erick", "Carman Neustaedter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neustaedter:Carman", "Tejinder K.
