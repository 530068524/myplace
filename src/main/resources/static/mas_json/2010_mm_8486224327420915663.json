Such videos are enriched by additional content. Possible forms of additional content are plaintext, richtext, images and videos. Interactivity is implemented based upon selection buttons which allow the user to follow different plotlines. Additional forms of interactivity are realized as clickable objects in the video and a table of contents for the video. The software provides a tool for manually cutting videos and an automated shot detection. The non-linear flow of the video can be designed using a scene graph with fork nodes. Editors for text and images support the user in adding information to the video. A finished video project is exported to an XML file with a specific schema and Flash video (flv) files. The player processes the XML file, plays the interactive video and shows additional contents. It can be customized to the requirements of the presentation of the video and the corporate design of the homepage the video is embedded in.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau"], "authors": ["Britta Meixner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meixner:Britta", "Beate Siegel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siegel:Beate", "G\u00fcnther H\u00f6lbling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=lbling:G=uuml=nther", "Franz Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Franz", "Harald Kosch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosch:Harald"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
