{"title": "Non-local Deep Features for Salient Object Detection.", "fields": ["grid", "salience", "object detection", "convolutional neural network", "image segmentation"], "abstract": "Saliency detection aims to highlight the most relevant objects in an image. Methods using conventional models struggle whenever salient objects are pictured on top of a cluttered background while deep neural nets suffer from excess complexity and slow evaluation speeds. In this paper, we propose a simplified convolutional neural network which combines local and global information through a multi-resolution 4\u00d75 grid structure. Instead of enforcing spacial coherence with a CRF or superpixels as is usually the case, we implemented a loss function inspired by the Mumford-Shah functional which penalizes errors on the boundary. We trained our model on the MSRA-B dataset, and tested it on six different saliency benchmark datasets. Results show that our method is on par with the state-of-the-art while reducing computation time by a factor of 18 to 100 times, enabling near real-time, high performance saliency detection.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Xiamen University", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Xiamen University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhiming Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Zhiming", "Akshaya Kumar Mishra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mishra:Akshaya_Kumar", "Andrew Achkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achkar:Andrew", "Justin A.
