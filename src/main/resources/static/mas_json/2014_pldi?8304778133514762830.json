We present a technique that recovers hand-coded levels of performance from a universal probabilistic language, for the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) MCMC inference algorithm. It takes a Church program as input and traces its execution to remove computation overhead. It then analyzes the trace for each proposal, using slicing, to identify the minimal computation needed to evaluate the MH acceptance probability. Generated incremental code is much faster than a baseline implementation (up to 600x) and usually as fast as handcoded MH kernels.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Seoul National University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Chung-Kil Hur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hur:Chung=Kil", "Aditya V.
