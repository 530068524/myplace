{"title": "On Randomizing Hash Functions to Strengthen the Security of Digital Signatures.", "fields": ["secure hash standard", "mdc 2", "swifft", "sha 2", "collision attack", "merkle signature scheme"], "abstract": "Halevi and Krawczyk proposed a message randomization algorithm called RMX as a front-end tool to the hash-then-sign digital signature schemes such as DSS and RSA in order to free their reliance on the collision resistance property of the hash functions. They have shown that to forge a RMX-hash-then-sign signature scheme, one has to solve a cryptanalytical task which is related to finding second preimages for the hash function. In this article, we will show how to use Dean's method of finding expandable messages for finding a second preimage in the Merkle-Damgard hash function to existentially forge a signature scheme based on a  t  -bit RMX-hash function which uses the Davies-Meyer compression functions (e.g., MD4, MD5, SHA family) in 2  t  /2 chosen messages plus 2  t  /2 + 1 off-line operations of the compression function and similar amount of memory. This forgery attack also works on the signature schemes that use Davies-Meyer schemes and a variant of RMX published by NIST in its Draft Special Publication (SP) 800-106. We discuss some important applications of our attack.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Praveen Gauravaram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gauravaram:Praveen", "Lars R.
