Assuming a stored data set of user preferences, reverse top-k queries have been introduced for retrieving the users that deem a given database object as one of their top- k  results. Reverse top- k  queries have already attracted significant interest in research, due to numerous real-life applications such as market analysis and product placement. Currently, the most efficient algorithm for computing the reverse top- k  set is  RTA .  RTA  has two main drawbacks when processing a reverse top- k  query: (i) it needs to access all stored user preferences, and (ii) it cannot avoid executing a top- k  query for each user preference that belongs to the result set. To address these limitations, in this paper, we identify useful properties for processing reverse top- k  queries without accessing each user's individual preferences nor executing the top- k  query. We propose an intuitive branch-and-bound algorithm for processing reverse top- k  queries efficiently and discuss novel optimizations to boost its performance. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed algorithm that outperforms RTA by a large margin.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "University of Piraeus", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Athens University of Economics and Business"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Akrivi Vlachou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vlachou:Akrivi", "Christos Doulkeridis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doulkeridis:Christos", "Kjetil N\u00f8rv\u00e5g.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/N=oslash=rv=aring=g:Kjetil", "Yannis Kotidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotidis:Yannis"], "pages": 12}
