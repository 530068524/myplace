{"title": "EchoTag: Accurate Infrastructure-Free Indoor Location Tagging with Smartphones.", "fields": ["phone", "embedded system", "multimedia", "audio signal", "usability"], "abstract": "We propose a novel mobile system, called EchoTag, that enables phones to tag and remember indoor locations without requiring any additional sensors or pre-installed infrastructure. The main idea behind EchoTag is to actively generate acoustic signatures by transmitting a sound signal with a phone's speakers and sensing its reflections with the phone's microphones. This active sensing provides finer-grained control of the collected signatures than the widely-used passive sensing. For example, because the sensing signal is controlled by EchoTag, it can be intentionally chosen to enrich the sensed signatures and remove noises from useless reflections. Extensive experiments show that EchoTag distinguishes 11 tags at 1cm resolution with 98% accuracy and maintains 90% accuracy even a week after its training. With this accurate location tagging, one can realize many interesting applications, such as automatically turning on the silent mode of a phone when it is placed at a pre-defined location/area near the bed or streaming favorite songs to speakers if it is placed near a home entertainment system. Most participants of our usability study agree on the usefulness of EchoTag's potential applications and the adequacy of its sensing accuracy for supporting these applications.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Yu-Chih Tung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tung:Yu=Chih", "Kang G.
