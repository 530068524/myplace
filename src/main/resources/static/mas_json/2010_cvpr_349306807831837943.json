The system is based on a novel hierarchical scheme which reduces the total complexity by one order of magnitude. We assess the quality of our approach analytically by comparing the recovered point clouds with laser scans, which serves as ground truth data.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Verona", "University of Verona", "University of Verona"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Riccardo Gherardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gherardi:Riccardo", "Michela Farenzena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farenzena:Michela", "Andrea Fusiello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fusiello:Andrea"], "pages": 7}
