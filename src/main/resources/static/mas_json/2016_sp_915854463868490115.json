We undertake an extensive examination of real censors by surveying prior measurement studies and analyzing field reports and bug tickets from practitioners. We assess both deployed circumvention approaches and research proposals to consider the criteria employed in their evaluations and compare these to the observed behaviors of real censors, identifying areas where evaluations could more faithfully and effectively incorporate the practices of modern censors. These observations lead to an agenda realigning research with the predominant problems of today.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["International Computer Science Institute", "International Computer Science Institute", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Michael Carl Tschantz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tschantz:Michael_Carl", "Sadia Afroz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Afroz:Sadia", "anonymous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/anonymous:", "Vern Paxson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paxson:Vern"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2016", "pages": 20}
