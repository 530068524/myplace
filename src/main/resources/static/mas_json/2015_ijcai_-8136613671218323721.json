Nevertheless, supervising and operating multiple robots at once is a difficult task for a single operator to execute. In this paper we propose a novel approach for utilizing advising automated agents when assisting an operator to better manage a team of multiple robots in complex environments. We introduce the Myopic Advice Optimization (MYAO) Problem and exemplify its implementation using an agent for the Search And Rescue (SAR) task. Our intelligent advising agent was evaluated through extensive field trials, with 44 non-expert human operators and 10 low-cost mobile robots, in simulation and physical deployment, and showed a significant improvement in both team performance and the operator's satisfaction.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University"], "authors": ["Ariel Rosenfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenfeld:Ariel", "Noa Agmon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agmon:Noa", "Oleg Maksimov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maksimov:Oleg", "Amos Azaria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azaria:Amos", "Sarit Kraus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraus:Sarit"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
