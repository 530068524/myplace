While systems that employ traditional WIMP-based interfaces have a well-established body of work describing their integration into classroom environments, more novel technologies generally lack such a foundation to guide their advancement. In this paper we present Robo-Tangible Activities for Geometry (rTAG), a tangible learning environment that utilizes a teachable agent framing, together with a physical robotic agent. We describe its deployment in a school environment, qualitatively analyzing how teachers chose to orchestrate its use, the value they saw in it, and the barriers they faced while organizing the sessions with their students. Based on this analysis, we extract four recommendations that aid in designing and deploying systems that make use of affordances that are similar to those of the rTAG system.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Carleton University", "New York University", "Arizona State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Victor Girotto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Girotto:Victor", "Cecil Lozano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lozano:Cecil", "Kasia Muldner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muldner:Kasia", "Winslow Burleson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burleson:Winslow", "Erin Walker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walker:Erin"], "pages": 12}
