Many real-world applications such as localized content-based image retrieval and text categorization can be viewed as MIL problems. In this paper, we propose a new graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for multiple instance learning. By defining an instance-level graph on the data, we first propose a new approach to construct an optimization framework for multiple instance semi-supervised learning, and derive an efficient way to overcome the non-convexity of MIL. We empirically show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MIL algorithms on several real-world data sets.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yangqing Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yangqing", "Changshui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changshui"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
