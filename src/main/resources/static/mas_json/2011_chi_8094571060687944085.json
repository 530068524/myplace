Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we introduce tech-niques to non-invasively measure a range of cognitive workload states that have implications to HCI research, most directly usability testing. We present a set of usability experiments that illustrates how fNIRS brain measurement provides information about the cognitive demands placed on computer users by different interface designs.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Hamilton College", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Hamilton College", "Hamilton College", "Hamilton College"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Leanne M.
