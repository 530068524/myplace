{"title": "Using rhythmic patterns as an input method.", "fields": ["repertoire", "input method", "channel", "rhythm", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "While interaction techniques that use the temporal dimension have been used for a long time, such as multiple clicks or spring-loaded widgets, more advanced uses of  rhythmic patterns  have received little attention in HCI. Using such temporal structures to convey information can be particularly useful in situations where the visual channel is overloaded or even not available. In this paper we introduce  Rhythmic Interaction  as the use of rhythms for input. We report the results of two experiments that show that (i) rhythmic patterns can be efficiently reproduced by novice users and recognized by computer algorithms, and (ii) rhythmic patterns can be memorized as efficiently as traditional shortcuts when associating them with visual commands. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of Rhythmic Interaction and open the way to a richer repertoire of interaction techniques.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Emilien Ghomi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghomi:Emilien", "Guillaume Faure.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faure:Guillaume", "St\u00e9phane Huot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huot:St=eacute=phane", "Olivier Chapuis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chapuis:Olivier", "Michel Beaudouin-Lafon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beaudouin=Lafon:Michel"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
