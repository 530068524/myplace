The primary defining characteristic of the ABL is that wind dynamics within this layer are influenced by the Earth's topography, as well as time-dependent temperature changes in the Earth's surface. In forests and connected valleys, weak-wind flows transport moisture, heat, gases and potential contaminants, directly impacting adjacent ecosystems [Thomas et al. 2012].", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Willamette University", "University of Bayreuth", "The Evergreen State College", "Willamette University"], "authors": ["Kendra A.
