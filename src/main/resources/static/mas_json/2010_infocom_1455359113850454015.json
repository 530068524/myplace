The proposed mechanism authenticates and monitors nodes with the so-called controller sets, which are resistant to the dynamic network membership. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme is robust even to collusion attacks and provides availability up to 90% better than proposals based on threshold cryptography. The performance improvement arises mostly from the controller sets autonomy to recover after network partitions.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Federal University of Rio de Janeiro", "Federal University of Rio de Janeiro", "Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"], "authors": ["Natalia Castro Fernandes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fernandes:Natalia_Castro", "Marcelo D.
