{"title": "Haptic Wave: A Cross-Modal Interface for Visually Impaired Audio Producers.", "fields": ["multimodal interaction", "dialog box", "digital audio", "studio", "participatory design"], "abstract": "We present the Haptic Wave, a device that allows cross-modal mapping of digital audio to the haptic domain, intended for use by audio producers/engineers with visual impairments. We describe a series of participatory design activities adapted to non-sighted users where the act of prototyping facilitates dialog. A series of workshops scoping user needs, and testing a technology mock up and lo-fidelity prototype fed into the design of a final high-spec prototype. The Haptic Wave was tested in the laboratory, then deployed in real world settings in recording studios and audio production facilities. The cross-modal mapping is kinesthetic and allows the direct manipulation of sound without the translation of an existing visual interface. The research gleans insight into working with users with visual impairments, and transforms perspective to think of them as experts in non-visual interfaces for all users.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Goldsmiths, University of London", "Goldsmiths, University of London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Atau Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Atau", "Adam Parkinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parkinson:Adam"], "pages": 12}
