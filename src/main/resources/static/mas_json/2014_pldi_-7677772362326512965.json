{"title": "Accurate application progress analysis for large-scale parallel debugging.", "fields": ["debugging", "accuracy and precision", "supercomputer", "overhead", "static analysis"], "abstract": "Debugging large-scale parallel applications is challenging. In most HPC applications, parallel tasks progress in a coordinated fashion, and thus a fault in one task can quickly propagate to other tasks, making it difficult to debug. Finding the least-progressed tasks can significantly reduce the effort to identify the task where the fault originated. However, existing approaches for detecting them suffer low accuracy and large overheads; either they use imprecise static analysis or are unable to infer progress dependence inside loops. We present a loop-aware progress-dependence analysis tool, Prodometer, which determines relative progress among parallel tasks via dynamic analysis. Our fault-injection experiments suggest that its accuracy and precision are over 90% for most cases and that it scales well up to 16,384 MPI tasks. Further, our case study shows that it significantly helped diagnosing a perplexing error in MPI, which only manifested at large scale.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Purdue University", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Subrata Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Subrata", "Ignacio Laguna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laguna:Ignacio", "Dong H.
