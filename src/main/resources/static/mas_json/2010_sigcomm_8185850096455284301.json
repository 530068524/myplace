To inform discussions of which variant should be deployed in the Internet, we quantify the ability of the main protocols (origin authentication, soBGP, S-BGP, and data-plane verification) to blunt traffic-attraction attacks; i.e., an attacker that deliberately attracts traffic to drop, tamper, or eavesdrop on packets.   Intuition suggests that an attacker can maximize the traffic he attracts by widely announcing a short path that is not flagged as bogus by the secure protocol. Through simulations on an empirically-determined AS-level topology, we show that this strategy is surprisingly effective, even when the network uses an advanced security solution like S-BGP or data-plane verification. Worse yet, we show that these results underestimate the severity of attacks. We prove that finding the most damaging strategy is NP-hard, and show how counterintuitive strategies, like announcing longer paths, announcing to fewer neighbors, or triggering BGP loop-detection, can be used to attract even more traffic than the strategy above. These counterintuitive examples are not merely hypothetical; we searched the empirical AS topology to identify specific ASes that can launch them. Finally, we find that a clever export policy can often attract almost as much traffic as a bogus path announcement. Thus, our work implies that mechanisms that police export policies (e.g., defensive filtering) are crucial, even if S-BGP is fully deployed.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of California, Berkeley", "AT&T", "Princeton University", "Boston University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "AT&T", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Sharon Goldberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldberg:Sharon", "Michael Schapira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schapira:Michael", "Peter Hummon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hummon:Peter", "Jennifer Rexford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rexford:Jennifer"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
