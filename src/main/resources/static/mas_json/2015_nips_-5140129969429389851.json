{"title": "Sparse PCA via Bipartite Matchings.", "fields": ["data matrix", "data point", "sparse pca", "small number", "disjoint sets"], "abstract": "We consider the following multi-component sparse PCA problem: given a set of data points, we seek to extract a small number of sparse components with disjoint supports that jointly capture the maximum possible variance. Such components can be computed one by one, repeatedly solving the single-component problem and deflating the input data matrix, but this greedy procedure is suboptimal. We present a novel algorithm for sparse PCA that jointly optimizes multiple disjoint components. The extracted features capture variance that lies within a multiplicative factor arbitrarily close to 1 from the optimal. Our algorithm is combinatorial and computes the desired components by solving multiple instances of the bipartite maximum weight matching problem. Its complexity grows as a low order polynomial in the ambient dimension of the input data, but exponentially in its rank. However, it can be effectively applied on a low-dimensional sketch of the input data. We evaluate our algorithm on real datasets and empirically demonstrate that in many cases it outperforms existing, deflation-based approaches.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Megasthenis Asteris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asteris:Megasthenis", "Dimitris S.
