These systems at higher performance are promising privacy preserving solutions for social applications. This paper contributes a realistic analytical model and a novel routing algorithm with provable polylog expected routing length. Using the model, we additionally prove that this can not be achieved by Freenet's routing. Simulations support that our proposed algorithm achieves a better performance than Freenet for realistic network sizes.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Stefanie Roos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roos:Stefanie", "Thorsten Strufe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strufe:Thorsten"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
