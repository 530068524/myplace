In particular, we consider an 802.11ac scenario in which the access point transmits on the downlink via MU-MIMO, whereas stations must employ single-user transmissions on the uplink. With the help of analytical models built for the different regimes that can occur in the considered system, we identify and explain crucial performance anomalies that can result in very low throughput in some scenarios, completely offsetting the theoretical gains achievable by MU-MIMO. We discuss solutions to mitigate the risk of this performance degradation and alternative uplink strategies allowing WLANs to approach their maximum theoretical capacity under MU-MIMO.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Rice University", "University of Turin", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Peshal Nayak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nayak:Peshal", "Michele Garetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garetto:Michele", "Edward W.
