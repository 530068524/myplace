{"title": "Frank-Wolfe with Subsampling Oracle.", "fields": ["oracle", "rate of convergence", "exponential function", "sublinear function", "lasso"], "abstract": "We analyze two novel randomized variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) or conditional gradient algorithm. While classical FW algorithms require solving a linear minimization problem over the domain at each iteration, the proposed method only requires to solve a linear minimization problem over a small \\emph{subset} of the original domain. The first algorithm that we propose is a randomized variant of the original FW algorithm and achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ sublinear convergence rate as in the deterministic counterpart. The second algorithm is a randomized variant of the Away-step FW algorithm, and again as its deterministic counterpart, reaches linear (i.e., exponential) convergence rate making it the first provably convergent randomized variant of Away-step FW. In both cases, while subsampling reduces the convergence rate by a constant factor, the linear minimization step can be a fraction of the cost of that of the deterministic versions, especially when the data is streamed. We illustrate computational gains of the algorithms on regression problems, involving both $\\ell_1$ and latent group lasso penalties.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Thomas Kerdreux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kerdreux:Thomas", "Fabian Pedregosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedregosa:Fabian", "Alexandre d'Aspremont.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/d=Aspremont:Alexandre"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
