{"title": "Reverse Engineering Queries in Ontology-Enriched Systems: The Case of Expressive Horn Description Logic Ontologies.", "fields": ["reverse engineering", "conjunctive query", "ontology", "description logic"], "abstract": "We introduce the query-by-example (QBE)\nparadigm for query answering in the presence of\nontologies. Intuitively, QBE permits non-expert\nusers to explore the data by providing examples\nof the information they (do not) want, which the\nsystem then generalizes into a query. Formally, we\nstudy the following question: given a knowledge\nbase and sets of positive and negative examples, is\nthere a query that returns all positive but none of\nthe negative examples? We focus on description\nlogic knowledge bases with ontologies formulated\nin Horn-ALCI and (unions of) conjunctive queries.\nOur main contributions are characterizations,\nalgorithms and tight complexity bounds for QBE.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Cardiff University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of Bremen", "University of Bremen"], "authors": ["V\u00edctor Guti\u00e9rrez-Basulto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guti=eacute=rrez=Basulto:V=iacute=ctor", "Jean Christoph Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Jean_Christoph", "Leif Sabellek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabellek:Leif"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
