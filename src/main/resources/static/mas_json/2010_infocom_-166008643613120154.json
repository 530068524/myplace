Unlike terrestrial networks, satellite networks face a unique set of challenges, such as signal fading and interference from multiple transmitters combined with long propagation delays. A well known challenge is that these unique characteristics can have an adverse impact on various protocols, making it necessary to study protocol behavior in satellite networks. The challenge of our research, and the focus of this paper, is to develop an architecture for a high-fidelity and scalable emulation testbed tailored for mobile satellite communications research. The testbed is designed to provide multi-beam, multi-satellite, TDMA, and mobility functionality. Our validation studies demonstrate that the testbed is capable of achieving delay, loss, and jitter that can be associated with a mobile satellite link.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Roman Chertov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chertov:Roman", "Daniel M.
