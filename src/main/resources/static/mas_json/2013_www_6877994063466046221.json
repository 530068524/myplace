Social media data can be very useful for expertise mining due to the variety of existing applications, the rich metadata, and the diversity of user associations with content. In this work, we provide an extensive study that explores the use of social media to infer expertise within a large global organization. We examine eight different social media applications by evaluating the data they produce through a large user survey, with 670 enterprise social media users. We distinguish between two semantics that relate a user to a topic: expertise in the topic and interest in it and compare these two semantics across the different social media applications.", "citation": "Citations (103)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Ido Guy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guy:Ido", "Uri Avraham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avraham:Uri", "David Carmel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carmel:David", "Sigalit Ur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ur:Sigalit", "Michal Jacovi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacovi:Michal", "Inbal Ronen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ronen:Inbal"], "conf": "www", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
