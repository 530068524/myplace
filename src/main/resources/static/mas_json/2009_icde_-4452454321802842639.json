{"title": "Best-Effort Top-k Query Processing Under Budgetary Constraints.", "fields": ["scheduling", "budget constraint", "probability density function", "financial management", "approximation algorithm"], "abstract": "We consider a novel problem of top-k query processing under budget constraints. We provide both a framework and a set of algorithms to address this problem. Existing algorithms for top-k processing are budget-oblivious, i.e., they do not take budget constraints into account when making scheduling decisions, but focus on the performance to compute the final top-k results. Under budget constraints, these algorithms therefore often return results that are a lot worse than the results that can be achieved with a clever, budget-aware scheduling algorithm. This paper introduces novel algorithms for budget-aware top-k processing that produce results that have a significantly higher quality than those of state-of-the-art budget-oblivious solutions.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "authors": ["Michal Shmueli-Scheuer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shmueli=Scheuer:Michal", "Chen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Chen", "Yosi Mass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mass:Yosi", "Haggai Roitman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roitman:Haggai", "Ralf Schenkel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schenkel:Ralf", "Gerhard Weikum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weikum:Gerhard"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
