By focusing on transactional access to a well-defined set of data structure operations, we strike a balance between the ease-of-programming of transactions and the efficiency of custom-tailored data structures. We exemplify this concept by designing and implementing a library supporting transactions on any number of maps, sets (implemented as skiplists), and queues. Our library offers efficient and scalable transactions, which are an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art transactional memory toolkits. Moreover, our approach treats stand-alone data structure operations (like put and enqueue) as first class citizens, and allows them to execute with virtually no overhead, at the speed of the original data structure library.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Yahoo!", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Alexander Spiegelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spiegelman:Alexander", "Guy Golan-Gueta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golan=Gueta:Guy", "Idit Keidar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keidar:Idit"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2016", "pages": 15}
