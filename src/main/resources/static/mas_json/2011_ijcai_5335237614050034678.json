We pursue the aim of reducing the search space by strictly increasing the number of forced propositional variables after the application of noninvertible rules. The focus of the paper is on a new tableau system for Dummett logic, for which we have an implementation.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Milan"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Guido Fiorino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiorino:Guido"], "pages": 6}
