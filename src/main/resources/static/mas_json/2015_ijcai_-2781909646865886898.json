The complexity analysis has emerged as the standard method to estimating the memory needed for solving a given computational problem, but complexity results may be somewhat limited. This paper introduces a general methodology-- structural analysis--for the design of optimality-preserving concise policies and value functions, which will eventually lead to the development of efficient theory and algorithms. For the first time, we show that memory requirements for policies and value functions may be asymmetric, resulting in cooperative, decentralized control models with exponential reductions in memory requirements.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Jilles Steeve Dibangoye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dibangoye:Jilles_Steeve", "Olivier Buffet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buffet:Olivier", "Olivier Simonin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simonin_0001:Olivier"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
