{"title": "A New d-DNNF-Based Bound Computation Algorithm for Functional E-MAJSAT.", "fields": ["knowledge compilation", "search tree", "probabilistic logic", "branch and bound", "solver"], "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for computing upper bounds for an optimization version of the EMAJSAT problem called functional E-MAJSAT. The algorithm utilizes the compilation language d-DNNF which underlies several state-of-the-art algorithms for solving related problems. This bound computation can be used in a branch-and-bound solver for solving functional E-MAJSAT. We then present a technique for pruning values from the branch-and-bound search tree based on the information available after each bound computation. We evaluated the proposed techniques in a MAP solver and a probabilistic conformant planner. In both cases, our experiments showed that the new techniques improved the efficiency of state-of-the-art solvers by orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Knot Pipatsrisawat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pipatsrisawat:Knot", "Adnan Darwiche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darwiche:Adnan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
