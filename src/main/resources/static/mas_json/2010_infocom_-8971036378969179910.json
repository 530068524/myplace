We consider a simple version of the Reference Point Group Mobility model, in which nodes belonging to the same group are constrained to lie in a disc area, whose center moves uniformly across the network according to the i.i.d. model. We assume fast mobility conditions and take as a primary goal the maximization of per-node throughput. We discover that correlated node movements have a huge impact on asymptotic throughput and delay and can sometimes lead to better performance than the one achievable under independent nodes movements.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin"], "authors": ["Delia Ciullo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciullo:Delia", "Valentina Martina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martina:Valentina", "Michele Garetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garetto:Michele", "Emilio Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Emilio"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
