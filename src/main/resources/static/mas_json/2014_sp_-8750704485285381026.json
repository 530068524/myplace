{"title": "ANONIZE: A Large-Scale Anonymous Survey System.", "fields": ["random oracle", "workstation", "secure multi party computation", "internet privacy", "public key cryptography"], "abstract": "A secure ad-hoc survey scheme enables a survey authority to independently (without any interaction) select an ad-hoc group of registered users based only on their identities (e.g., their email addresses), and create a survey where only selected users can anonymously submit exactly one response. We present a formalization of secure ad-hoc surveys and a provably-secure implementation in the random oracle model, called ANONIZE. Our performance analysis shows that ANONIZE enables securely implementing million-person anonymous surveys using a single modern workstation. As far as we know, ANONIZE constitutes the first implementation of a large-scale secure computation protocol (of non-trivial functionalities) that scales to millions of users.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Cornell University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Susan Hohenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hohenberger:Susan", "Steven Myers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Myers:Steven", "Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael", "Abhi Shelat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shelat:Abhi"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2014", "pages": 15}
