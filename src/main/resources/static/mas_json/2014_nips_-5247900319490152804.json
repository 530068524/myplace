{"title": "Optimistic Planning in Markov Decision Processes Using a Generative Model.", "fields": ["sample complexity", "partially observable markov decision process", "generative model", "markov decision process", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of online planning in a Markov decision process with discounted rewards for any given initial state. We consider the PAC sample complexity problem of computing, with probability 1 - \u03b4, an \u220a-optimal action using the smallest possible number of calls to the generative model (which provides reward and next-state samples). We design an algorithm, called StOP (for Stochastic-Optimistic Planning), based on the \"optimism in the face of uncertainty\" principle. StOP can be used in the general setting, requires only a generative model, and enjoys a complexity bound that only depends on the local structure of the MDP.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Bal\u00e1zs Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sz=ouml=r=eacute=nyi:Bal=aacute=zs", "Gunnar Kedenburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kedenburg:Gunnar", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "pages": 9}
