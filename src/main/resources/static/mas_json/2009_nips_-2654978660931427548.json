We consider the general, bichromatic case for these problems, in addition to the scientific problem of N-body simulation. In this paper we show for the first time O(N) worst case runtimes for practical algorithms for these problems based on the cover tree data structure [1].", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Parikshit Ram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ram:Parikshit", "Dongryeol Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Dongryeol", "William B.
