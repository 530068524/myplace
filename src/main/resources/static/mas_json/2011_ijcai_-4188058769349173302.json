BENCH is designed for underdetermined problems. In our experiments, we use Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) classifiers as base classifiers in the ensemble; however, BENCH can be applied to other classification models as well. We show that BENCH is able to increase prediction accuracy of a single classifier and traditional ensemble of classifiers by up to 15% on three microarray datasets using various weighting schemes for combining individual predictions in the ensemble.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "Zhejiang University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Tatdow Pansombut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pansombut:Tatdow", "William Hendrix.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hendrix:William", "Zekai Jacob Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Zekai_Jacob", "Brent E.
