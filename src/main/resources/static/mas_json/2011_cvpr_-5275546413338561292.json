Despite of this overflow of visual information, humans are extremely good at remembering thousands of pictures along with some of their visual details. But not all images are equal in memory. Some stitch to our minds, and other are forgotten. In this paper we focus on the problem of predicting how memorable an image will be. We show that memorability is a stable property of an image that is shared across different viewers. We introduce a database for which we have measured the probability that each picture will be remembered after a single view. We analyze image features and labels that contribute to making an image memorable, and we train a predictor based on global image descriptors. We find that predicting image memorability is a task that can be addressed with current computer vision techniques. Whereas making memorable images is a challenging task in visualization and photography, this work is a first attempt to quantify this useful quality of images.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Phillip Isola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isola:Phillip", "Jianxiong Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Jianxiong", "Antonio Torralba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torralba_0001:Antonio", "Aude Oliva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliva:Aude"], "pages": 8}
