{"title": "Learning deep representations for ground-to-aerial geolocalization.", "fields": ["deep learning", "computer vision", "pattern recognition", "geospatial analysis", "feature detection"], "abstract": "The recent availability of geo-tagged images and rich geospatial data has inspired a number of algorithms for image based geolocalization. Most approaches predict the location of a query image by matching to ground-level images with known locations (e.g., street-view data). However, most of the Earth does not have ground-level reference photos available. Fortunately, more complete coverage is provided by oblique aerial or \u201cbird's eye\u201d imagery. In this work, we localize a ground-level query image by matching it to a reference database of aerial imagery. We use publicly available data to build a dataset of 78K aligned crossview image pairs. The primary challenge for this task is that traditional computer vision approaches cannot handle the wide baseline and appearance variation of these cross-view pairs. We use our dataset to learn a feature representation in which matching views are near one another and mismatched views are far apart. Our proposed approach, Where-CNN, is inspired by deep learning success in face verification and achieves significant improvements over traditional hand-crafted features and existing deep features learned from other large-scale databases. We show the effectiveness of Where-CNN in finding matches between street view and aerial view imagery and demonstrate the ability of our learned features to generalize to novel locations.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Brown University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tsung-Yi Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Tsung=Yi", "Yin Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Yin", "Serge J.
