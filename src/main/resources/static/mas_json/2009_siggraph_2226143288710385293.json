In the sport mode, a rider is in a forward-tilted posture with first and second link plates in a wide-spread state. The bend angle \u03b81 between a first line segment and a second line segment is a little less than 180\u00b0. When the first and second link plates are folded into a V-shape, a rear structure body is turned counterclockwise and a front structure body is turned clockwise. The bend angle \u03b82 is reduced. The road clearance of a drive source support case is smaller with the position of center of gravity and the seat being lower. As a result, a cruiser mode is achieved. While being a single vehicle, a change in the position of its center of gravity and in the vehicle body form is achieved.", "citation": "Citations (362)", "departments": ["Honda", "Honda", "Honda", "Honda", "Honda", "China Earthquake Administration", "China Earthquake Administration", "China Earthquake Administration", "University of California, Los Angeles", "China Earthquake Administration", "China Earthquake Administration", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Saint Paul University", "University of Tokyo", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Scripps Institution of Oceanography", "China Earthquake Administration", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Peking University", "China Earthquake Administration", "University of California, Berkeley", "M 2 Medical A/S (Gentofte, DK)"], "authors": ["David Muth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muth:David"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
