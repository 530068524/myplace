{"title": "Genie: Input Retargeting on the Web through Command Reverse Engineering.", "fields": ["web application", "program analysis", "dynamic program analysis", "retargeting", "web modeling"], "abstract": "Most web applications are designed as one-size-fits-all, despite considerable variation in people's expertise, physical abilities, and other factors that impact interaction. For example, some web applications require the use of a mouse, precluding use by many people with severe motor disabilities. Other applications require laborious manual input that a skilled developer could automate if the application were scriptable. This paper presents Genie, a system that automatically reverse engineers an abstract model of the underlying commands in a web application, then enables interaction with that functionality through alternative interfaces and other input modalities (e.g., speech, keyboard, or command line input). Genie comprises an abstract model of command properties, behaviors, and dependencies as well as algorithms that reverse engineer this model from an existing web application through static and dynamic program analysis. We evaluate Genie by developing several interfaces that automatically add support for speech, keyboard, and command line input to arbitrary web applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Amanda Swearngin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swearngin:Amanda", "Andrew J.
