This lets the tracker specialize in both rigid and deformable objects on-line and with no prior assumptions. We provide a probabilistic model of the object variations over time. The model is implemented using the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) with two parameters that control the cost of moving pixels and changing their color. We adjust these costs on-line during tracking to account for the amount of local (dis)order in the object. We show LOT's tracking capabilities on challenging video sequences, both commonly used and new, demonstrating performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (344)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "General Motors", "General Motors", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Microsoft", "General Motors", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shaul Oron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oron:Shaul", "Aharon Bar-Hillel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bar=Hillel:Aharon", "Dan Levi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levi:Dan", "Shai Avidan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avidan:Shai"], "pages": 8}
