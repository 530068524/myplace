So far these problems have been stated for general (number) rings but have only been closely examined for cyclotomic number rings. In this paper, we state and examine the Ring-LWE problem for general number rings and demonstrate provably weak instances of the Decision Ring-LWE problem. We construct an explicit family of number fields for which we have an efficient attack. We demonstrate the attack in both theory and practice, providing code and running times for the attack. The attack runs in time linear in q, where q is the modulus.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["McGill University", "Microsoft", "Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Yara Elias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elias:Yara", "Kristin E.
