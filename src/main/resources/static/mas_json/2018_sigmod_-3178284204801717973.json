We investigate the fixed-parameter tractability of three fundamental problems related to GFD discovery. We show that the implication and satisfiability problems are fixed-parameter tractable, but the validation problem is co-W[1]-hard. We introduce notions of reduced GFDs and their topological support, and formalize the discovery problem for GFDs. We develop algorithms for discovering GFDs and computing their covers. Moreover, we show that GFD discovery is feasible over large-scale graphs, by providing parallel scalable algorithms for discovering GFDs that guarantee to reduce running time when more processors are used. Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and scalability of the algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Beihang University", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Beihang University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Wenfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wenfei", "Chunming Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Chunming", "Xueli Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xueli", "Ping Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Ping"], "pages": 13}
