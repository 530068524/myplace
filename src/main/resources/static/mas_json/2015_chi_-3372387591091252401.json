{"title": "ExtensionSticker: A Proposal for a Striped Pattern Sticker to Extend Touch Interfaces and its Assessment.", "fields": ["conductive ink", "computer hardware", "scrolling", "computer science"], "abstract": "In this study, we propose a striped pattern sticker called ExtensionSticker that allows a touch input to be transferred from an external source by simply attaching the sticker to a touch panel. This allows the user to input touches or continuous scrolling actions by touching a sticker printed with stripes of conductive ink, without directly touching the touch panel. This method could be applied to the sides or back of a touch panel, or even the surface upon which a device is located as a touch interface, allowing us to freely construct interfaces in shapes matching the demands of the user. This paper also reports the results of evaluation experiments conducted to assess the recognition accuracy of scroll and tap actions using the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Meiji University", "Meiji University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kunihiro Kato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kato:Kunihiro", "Homei Miyashita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miyashita:Homei"], "pages": 4}
