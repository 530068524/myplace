While previous approaches construct a low-dimensional Euclidean embedding of the data set that reflects the given similarity triplets, we aim at defining kernel functions that correspond to high-dimensional embeddings. These kernel functions can subsequently be used to apply any kernel method to the data set.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of T\u00fcbingen"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Matth\u00e4us Kleindessner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleindessner:Matth=auml=us", "Ulrike von Luxburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luxburg:Ulrike_von"], "pages": 11}
