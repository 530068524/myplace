There are three fundamental operations when bringing a new device into any of these settings: to configure the device to join the wireless local-area network, to partner the device with other nearby devices so they can work together, and (3) to configure the device so it connects to the relevant individual or organizational account in the cloud. The challenge is to accomplish all three goals simply, securely, and consistent with user intent. We present a novel approach we call Wanda \u2014 a \u2018magic wand\u2019 that accomplishes all three of the above goals \u2014 and evaluate a prototype implementation.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College"], "authors": ["Timothy J.
