{"title": "CloudCache: Expanding and shrinking private caches.", "fields": ["cache algorithms", "cache coloring", "cpu cache", "smart cache", "cache pollution"], "abstract": "The number of cores in a single chip multiprocessor is expected to grow in coming years. Likewise, aggregate on-chip cache capacity is increasing fast and its effective utilization is becoming ever more important. Furthermore, available cores are expected to be underutilized due to the power wall and highly heterogeneous future workloads. This trend makes existing L2 cache management techniques less effective for two problems: increased capacity interference between working cores and longer L2 access latency. We propose a novel scalable cache management framework called CloudCache that creates dynamically expanding and shrinking L2 caches for working threads with fine-grained hardware monitoring and control. The key architectural components of CloudCache are L2 cache chaining, inter- and intra-bank cache partitioning, and a performance-optimized coherence protocol. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that CloudCache significantly improves performance of a wide range of workloads when all or a subset of cores are occupied.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Hyunjin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hyunjin", "Sangyeun Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Sangyeun", "Bruce R.
