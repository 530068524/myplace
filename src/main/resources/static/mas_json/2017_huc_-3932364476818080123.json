{"title": "WAHM - 4th workshop on ubiquitous technologies to augment the human mind: sharing experiences.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "emerging technologies", "social computing", "augment", "knowledge management", "upload", "computer science", "memory augmentation", "lifelog"], "abstract": "A recurring science fiction theme is the  downloading of abilities from another human to one's own mind.  Emerging technologies beyond simple audio/video recordings such as: 360\u00b0 videos, tactile recorders and odor recorders are promising tools to enable skill transfer and empathy. However, the produced large datasets require new means for selecting, displaying and sharing experiences. This workshop will bring together researchers from a wide range of computing disciplines, such as virtual reality, mobile computing, privacy and security, social computing and ethnography, usability, and systems research. Furthermore, we will invite researchers from related disciplines such as psychology and economics. The objective is to discuss how these trends are changing our existing research on sharing experiences and knowledge to augment the human mind.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Manchester", "University of Stuttgart", "Keio University", "University of Stuttgart", "Kobe University", "University of Manchester", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "Kobe University"], "authors": ["Sarah Clinch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clinch:Sarah", "Tilman Dingler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dingler:Tilman", "Kai Kunze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunze:Kai", "Passant El Agroudy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agroudy:Passant_El", "Tsutomu Terada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terada:Tsutomu"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
