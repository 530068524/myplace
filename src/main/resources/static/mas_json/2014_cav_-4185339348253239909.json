Our hope is that this experience report will serve the verification community by helping to inform future tooling efforts.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Google", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ethel Bardsley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardsley:Ethel", "Adam Betts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Betts:Adam", "Nathan Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Nathan", "Peter Collingbourne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collingbourne:Peter", "Pantazis Deligiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deligiannis:Pantazis", "Alastair F.
