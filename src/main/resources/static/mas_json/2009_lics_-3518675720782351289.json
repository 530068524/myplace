{"title": "Dinatural Terms in System F.", "fields": ["diagram", "second order logic", "game semantics", "parametricity", "system f"], "abstract": "We provide in this article two characterisation results, describing exactly which terms verify the dinaturality diagram, in Church-style system F and in Curry-style system F. The proof techniques we use here are purely syntactic, giving in particular a direct construction of the two terms generated by the dinaturality diagram. But the origin of these techniques lies in fact directly on the analysis of system F through game semantics. Thus, this article provides an example of backward engineering, where powerful syntactic results can be extracted from a semantic analysis.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Inst. de Math.  ... rseille, France"], "authors": ["Joachim De Lataillade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lataillade:Joachim_De"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
