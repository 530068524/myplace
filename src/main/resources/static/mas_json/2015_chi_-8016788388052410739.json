{"title": "All about that Base: Differing Player Experiences in Video Game Genres and the Unique Case of MOBA Games.", "fields": ["immersion", "multimedia", "teamwork", "frustration", "self determination theory", "game mechanics"], "abstract": "Video games provide unique interactive player experiences (PX) often categorised into different genres. Prior research has looked at different game genres, but rarely through a PX lens. Especially, PX in the emerging area of massive online battle arena (MOBA) games is not well understood by researchers in the field. We address this knowledge gap by presenting a PX study of different game genres, which we followed up with a second semi-structured interview study about PX in MOBA games. Among the results of our analyses are that games that are likely played with other players, such as MOBA games, stimulate less immersion and presence for players. Additionally, while challenge and frustration are significantly higher in this genre, players get a sense of satisfaction from teamwork, competition and mastery of complex gameplay interactions. Our study is the first to contribute a comprehensive insight into key motivators of MOBA players and how PX in this genre is different from other genres.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "University of Ontario Institute of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel M.
