{"title": "Panther: Fast Top-k Similarity Search on Large Networks.", "fields": ["vertex", "random walk", "biological network", "path length", "nearest neighbor search"], "abstract": "Estimating similarity between vertices is a fundamental issue in network analysis across various domains, such as social networks and biological networks. Methods based on common neighbors and structural contexts have received much attention. However, both categories of methods are difficult to scale up to handle large networks (with billions of nodes). In this paper, we propose a sampling method that provably and accurately estimates the similarity between vertices. The algorithm is based on a novel idea of  random path . Specifically, given a network, we perform  R  random walks, each starting from a randomly picked vertex and walking  T  steps. Theoretically, the algorithm guarantees that the sampling size  R  =  O (2e -2  log 2   T ) depends on the error-bound e, the confidence level (1 -- \u03b4), and the path length  T  of each random walk.   We perform extensive empirical study on a Tencent microblogging network of 1,000,000,000 edges. We show that our algorithm can return top-k similar vertices for any vertex in a network 300\u00d7 faster than the state-of-the-art methods. We also use two applications-identity resolution and structural hole spanner finding--to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated similarities. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves clearly better performance than several alternative methods.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "School of Compu ...
