{"title": "Voices from the War: Design as a Means of Understanding the Experience of Visiting Heritage.", "fields": ["embodied cognition", "soundscape", "design research", "bespoke", "design elements and principles"], "abstract": "We use design research to explore ways in which tangible and embodied interaction can be used to create novel experiences of heritage. We identified five design principles and used them to frame the challenge. In collaboration with curators, we co-created an interactive multi-narrative soundscape for the remains of trenches and a fortified camp from World War I. The soundscape is activated by presence and the use of a bespoke device. The design intertwines technology and historical content in context to augment the visitors' experience of the place in an evocative, personal way. The field trial showed that experimenting with different forms is key, as they have an impact on visitors' expectations beyond what they experience directly. It also showed the value in simultaneously designing interaction and content to achieve an effect that goes beyond the contribution of the single components.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Sheffield Hallam University", "Sheffield Hallam University", "Sheffield Hallam University", "fondazione bruno kessler", "Museo Storico I ...
