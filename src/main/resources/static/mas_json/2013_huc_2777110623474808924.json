{"title": "Crowdsourcing on the spot: altruistic use of public displays, feasibility, performance, and behaviours.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "human computer interaction", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "This study is the first attempt to investigate altruistic use of interactive public displays in natural usage settings as a crowdsourcing mechanism. We test a non-paid crowdsourcing service on public displays with eight different motivation settings and analyse users' behavioural patterns and crowdsourcing performance (e.g., accuracy, time spent, tasks completed). The results show that altruistic use, such as for crowdsourcing, is feasible on public displays, and through the controlled use of motivational design and validation check mechanisms, performance can be improved. The results shed insights on three research challenges in the field: i) how does crowdsourcing performance on public displays compare to that of online crowdsourcing, ii) how to improve the quality of feedback collected from public displays which tends to be noisy, and iii) identify users' behavioural patterns towards crowdsourcing on public displays in natural usage settings.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Madeira"], "authors": ["Jorge Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Jorge", "Denzil Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Denzil", "Simo Hosio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosio:Simo", "Yong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yong", "Jakob Rogstadius.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogstadius:Jakob", "Hannu Kukka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kukka:Hannu", "Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
