{"title": "DIDO: Dynamic Pipelines for In-Memory Key-Value Stores on Coupled CPU-GPU Architectures.", "fields": ["conventional pci", "dido", "throughput", "central processing unit", "work stealing"], "abstract": "As an emerging hardware, the coupled CPU-GPU architecture integrates a CPU and a GPU into a single chip, where the two processors share the same memory space. This special property opens up new opportunities for building in-memory keyvalue store systems, as it eliminates the data transfer costs on PCI-e bus, and enables fine-grained cooperation between the CPU and the GPU. In this paper, we propose DIDO, an in-memory key-value store system with dynamic pipeline executions on the coupled CPU-GPU architecture, to address the limitations and drawbacks of state-of-the-art system designs. DIDO is capable of adapting to different workloads through dynamically adjusting the pipeline with fine-grained task assignment to the CPU and the GPU at runtime. By exploiting the hardware features of coupled CPU-GPU architectures, DIDO achieves this goal with a set of techniques, including dynamic pipeline partitioning, flexible index operation assignment, and work stealing. We develop a cost model guided adaption mechanism to determine the optimal pipeline configuration. Our experiments have shown the effectiveness of DIDO in significantly enhancing the system throughput for diverse workloads.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "National University of Singapore", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Kai Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Kai", "Jiayu Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Jiayu", "Bingsheng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Bingsheng", "Bei Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Bei"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
