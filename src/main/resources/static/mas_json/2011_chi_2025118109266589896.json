Prompted by the social nature of many of the emerging applications, this paper presents our investigation of the sociality of weight management as experienced by a broad demographic of individuals. Our findings highlight the broad scope of peer involvement, and provide insight into the context and mechanics of related interaction that may prove valuable in informing the next generation of peer-based weight management technology for use in everyday life.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National Research Council", "University of Glasgow"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Julie Maitland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maitland:Julie", "Matthew Chalmers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chalmers:Matthew"], "pages": 10}
