By using the tool of ultra-products, a preservation theorem, which asserts that a disjunctive logic program without default negation is bounded with respect to the proposed semantics if and only if it has a first-order equivalent, is then obtained. For the disjunctive logic programs with default negation, a sufficient condition assuring the first-order expressibility is also proposed.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Western Sydney", "University of Western Sydney"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Heng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Heng", "Yan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Yan"], "pages": 7}
