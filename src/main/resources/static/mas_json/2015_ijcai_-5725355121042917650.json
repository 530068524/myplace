However, HRL may need longer time to obtain the optimal policy because of its large action space. Potential Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) has been widely used to incorporate heuristics into flat RL algorithms so as to reduce their exploration. In this paper, we investigate the integration of PBRS and HRL, and propose a new algorithm: PBRS-MAXQ- 0. We prove that under certain conditions, PBRS-MAXQ- 0 is guaranteed to converge. Empirical results show that PBRS-MAXQ-0 significantly outperforms MAXQ-0 given good heuristics, and can converge even when given misleading heuristics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Yang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yang", "Francesca Toni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toni:Francesca"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
