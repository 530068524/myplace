{"title": "A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to Acoustic Model Discovery.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "acoustic model", "timit", "mixture model", "dirichlet process"], "abstract": "We investigate the problem of acoustic modeling in which prior language-specific knowledge and transcribed data are unavailable. We present an unsupervised model that simultaneously segments the speech, discovers a proper set of sub-word units (e.g., phones) and learns a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each induced acoustic unit. Our approach is formulated as a Dirichlet process mixture model in which each mixture is an HMM that represents a sub-word unit. We apply our model to the TIMIT corpus, and the results demonstrate that our model discovers sub-word units that are highly correlated with English phones and also produces better segmentation than the state-of-the-art unsupervised baseline. We test the quality of the learned acoustic models on a spoken term detection task. Compared to the baselines, our model improves the relative precision of top hits by at least 22.1% and outperforms a language-mismatched acoustic model.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Chia-ying Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chia=ying", "James R.
