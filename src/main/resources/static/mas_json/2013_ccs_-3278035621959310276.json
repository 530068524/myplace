{"title": "Multi-cloud oblivious storage.", "fields": ["internet access", "cloud computing", "software deployment", "oblivious ram", "provisioning"], "abstract": "We present a 2-cloud oblivious storage (ORAM) system that achieves 2.6X bandwidth cost between the client and the cloud. Splitting an ORAM across 2 or more non-colluding clouds allows us to reduce the client-cloud bandwidth cost by at least one order of magnitude, shifting the higher-bandwidth communication to in-between the clouds where bandwidth provisioning is abundant. Our approach makes ORAM practical for bandwidth-constrained clients such as home or mobile Internet connections. We provide a full-fledged implementation of our 2-cloud ORAM system, and report results from a real-world deployment over Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Emil Stefanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefanov:Emil", "Elaine Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Elaine"], "pages": 12}
