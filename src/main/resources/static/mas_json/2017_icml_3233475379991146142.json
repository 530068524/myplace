To scale to higher dimensional\nproblems, we leverage the sample efficiency of\nBayesian optimization in a local context. The\noptimization of the acquisition function is restricted\nto the vicinity of a Gaussian search distribution\nwhich is moved towards high value areas\nof the objective. The proposed informationtheoretic\nupdate of the search distribution results\nin a Bayesian interpretation of local stochastic\nsearch: the search distribution encodes prior\nknowledge on the optimum\u2019s location and is\nweighted at each iteration by the likelihood of\nthis location\u2019s optimality. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our algorithm on several benchmark\nobjective functions as well as a continuous\nrobotic task in which an informative prior is obtained\nby imitation learning.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "authors": ["Riad Akrour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akrour:Riad", "Dmitry Sorokin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sorokin:Dmitry", "Jan Peters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peters_0001:Jan", "Gerhard Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann:Gerhard"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
