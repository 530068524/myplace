Furthermore, the teaching assistants are too overloaded to give detailed feedback on submitted homework assignments. We introduce Mechanix, a computer-assisted tutoring system for engineering students. Mechanix uses recognition of freehand sketches to provide instant, detailed, and formative feedback as the student progresses through each homework assignment, quiz, or exam. Free sketch recognition techniques allow students to solve free-body diagram and static truss problems as if they were using a pen and paper. The same recognition algorithms enable professors to add new unique problems simply by sketching out the correct answer. Mechanix is able to ease the burden of grading so that instructors can assign more free response questions, which provide a better measure of student progress than multiple choice questions do.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "University of Minnesota", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Martin Field.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Field:Martin", "Stephanie Valentine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valentine:Stephanie", "Julie Linsey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linsey:Julie", "Tracy Hammond.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hammond:Tracy"], "pages": 6}
