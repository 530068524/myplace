We describe a latent factor approach to infer invariants underlying system variables and how we can leverage these relationships to monitor a cyber-physical system. In particular we illustrate how this approach helps rapidly identify outliers during system operation.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Marjan Momtazpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Momtazpour:Marjan", "Jinghe Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jinghe", "Saifur Rahman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahman:Saifur", "Ratnesh K.
