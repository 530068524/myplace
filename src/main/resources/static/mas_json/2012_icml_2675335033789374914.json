{"title": "Approximate Modified Policy Iteration.", "fields": ["fixed point iteration", "power iteration", "propagation of uncertainty", "markov decision process", "implementation"], "abstract": "Modified policy iteration (MPI) is a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that contains the two celebrated policy and value iteration methods. Despite its generality, MPI has not been thoroughly studied, especially its approximation form which is used when the state and/or action spaces are large or infinite. In this paper, we propose three implementations of approximate MPI (AMPI) that are extensions of well-known approximate DP algorithms: fitted-value iteration, fitted-Q iteration, and classification-based policy iteration. We provide error propagation analysis that unifies those for approximate policy and value iteration. For the classification-based implementation, we develop a finite-sample analysis that shows that MPI's main parameter allows to control the balance between the estimation error of the classifier and the overall value function approximation.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Metz"], "authors": ["Bruno Scherrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scherrer:Bruno", "Victor Gabillon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gabillon:Victor", "Mohammad Ghavamzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghavamzadeh:Mohammad", "Matthieu Geist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geist:Matthieu"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
