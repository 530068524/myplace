The proposed approach is based on a graph-based label propagation technique. One constructs a nearest-neighbor similarity graph over all trigrams of labeled and unlabeled data for propagating syntactic information, i.e., label distributions. The derived label distributions are regarded as virtual evidences to regularize the learning of linear conditional random fields (CRFs) on unlabeled data. An inductive character-based joint model is obtained eventually. Empirical results on Chinese tree bank (CTB-7) and Microsoft Research corpora (MSR) reveal that the proposed model can yield better results than the supervised baselines and other competitive semi-supervised CRFs in this task.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Macau", "University of Macau", "University of Macau", "INESC-ID"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xiaodong Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Xiaodong", "Derek F.
