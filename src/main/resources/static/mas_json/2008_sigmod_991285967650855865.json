{"title": "Building a database on S3.", "fields": ["commit", "eventual consistency", "high availability", "scalability", "concurrency"], "abstract": "There has been a great deal of hype about Amazon's simple storage service (S3). S3 provides infinite scalability and high availability at low cost. Currently, S3 is used mostly to store multi-media documents (videos, photos, audio) which are shared by a community of people and rarely updated. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the opportunities and limitations of using S3 as a storage system for general-purpose database applications which involve small objects and frequent updates. Read, write, and commit protocols are presented. Furthermore, the cost ($), performance, and consistency properties of such a storage system are studied.", "citation": "Citations (346)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "ETH Zurich", "28msec Inc., Zu ... ch, Switzerland", "28msec Inc., Zu ... ch, Switzerland", "28msec Inc., Zu ... ch, Switzerland"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Matthias Brantner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brantner:Matthias", "Daniela Florescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Florescu:Daniela", "David A.
