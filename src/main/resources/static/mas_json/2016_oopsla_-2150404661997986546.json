We add derivatives as a novel first-class feature to a standard parser combinator language. First-class derivatives enable an inversion of the control flow, allowing to implement modular parsers for languages that previously required separate pre-processing steps or cross-cutting modifications of the parsers. We show that our framework offers new opportunities for reuse and supports a modular definition of interesting use cases of layout-sensitive parsing.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of T\u00fcbingen"], "authors": ["Jonathan Immanuel Brachth\u00e4user.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brachth=auml=user:Jonathan_Immanuel", "Tillmann Rendel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rendel:Tillmann", "Klaus Ostermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostermann:Klaus"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2016", "pages": 19}
