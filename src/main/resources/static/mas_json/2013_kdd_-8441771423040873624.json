{"title": "SIGMa: simple greedy matching for aligning large knowledge bases.", "fields": ["simple algorithm", "local search", "sigma", "scalability", "greedy algorithm"], "abstract": "The Internet has enabled the creation of a growing number of large-scale knowledge bases in a variety of domains containing complementary information. Tools for automatically aligning these knowledge bases would make it possible to unify many sources of structured knowledge and answer complex queries. However, the efficient alignment of large-scale knowledge bases still poses a considerable challenge. Here, we present Simple Greedy Matching (SiGMa), a simple algorithm for aligning knowledge bases with millions of entities and facts. SiGMa is an iterative propagation algorithm that leverages both the structural information from the relationship graph and flexible similarity measures between entity properties in a greedy local search, which makes it scalable. Despite its greedy nature, our experiments indicate that SiGMa can efficiently match some of the world's largest knowledge bases with high accuracy. We provide additional experiments on benchmark datasets which demonstrate that SiGMa can outperform state-of-the-art approaches both in accuracy and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Simon Lacoste-Julien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lacoste=Julien:Simon", "Konstantina Palla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palla:Konstantina", "Alex Davies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davies:Alex", "Gjergji Kasneci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasneci:Gjergji", "Thore Graepel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graepel:Thore", "Zoubin Ghahramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghahramani:Zoubin"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
