{"title": "Learning Scripts as Hidden Markov Models.", "fields": ["maximum entropy markov model", "scripting language", "missing data", "inference", "graphical model"], "abstract": "Scripts have been proposed to model the stereotypical event sequences found in narratives. They can be applied to make a variety of inferences including filling gaps in the narratives and resolving ambiguous references. This paper proposes the first formal framework for scripts based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Our framework supports robust inference and learning algorithms, which are lacking in previous clustering models. We develop an algorithm for structure and parameter learning based on Expectation Maximization and evaluate it on a number of natural datasets. The results show that our algorithm is superior to several informed baselines for predicting missing events in partial observation sequences.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["School of EECS, ... , Corvallis OR", "School of EECS, ... , Corvallis OR", "School of EECS, ... , Corvallis OR", "School of EECS, ... , Corvallis OR", "School of EECS, ... , Corvallis OR"], "authors": ["John Walker Orr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orr:John_Walker", "Prasad Tadepalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tadepalli:Prasad", "Janardhan Rao Doppa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doppa:Janardhan_Rao", "Xiaoli Z.
