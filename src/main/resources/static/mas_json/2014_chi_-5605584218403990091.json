{"title": "WADE: simplified GUI add-on development for third-party software.", "fields": ["wysiwyg", "graphical user interface", "software", "development environment", "source code"], "abstract": "We present the WADE Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which simplifies interface and functionality modification of existing third-party software without access to source code. WADE clones the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of a host program through dynamic-link library (DLL) injection, enabling modifications to (1) the GUI in a WYSIWYG fashion and (2) software functionality. We compare WADE with an alternative state-of-the-art runtime toolkit overloading approach in a user-study, whose results demonstrate that WADE significantly simplifies the task of GUI-based add-on development.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Xiaojun Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Xiaojun", "Shengdong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shengdong", "Yongfeng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yongfeng", "Zhongyuan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongyuan", "James Eagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eagan:James", "Ramanathan Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Ramanathan"], "pages": 10}
