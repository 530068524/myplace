In a two-stage study, 20 users first generated words or phrases to describe how they used the group, and what they enjoyed about their use. These phrases were coded into 34 questionnaire items that were then completed by 57 new participants. Factor analysis on this data revealed four gratifications: contribution; discovery; social interaction and entertainment. These factors are interpreted and discussed, leading to design implications and guidelines aimed at informing the design of future online services that combine media sharing with social interaction to create online systems based on a rich and meaningful object-centered sociality.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute", "University of Madeira", "Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute", "University of Madeira", "Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute"], "authors": ["Mayur Karnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karnik:Mayur", "Ian Oakley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oakley:Ian", "Jayant Venkatanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkatanathan:Jayant", "Tasos Spiliotopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spiliotopoulos:Tasos", "Valentina Nisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nisi:Valentina"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
