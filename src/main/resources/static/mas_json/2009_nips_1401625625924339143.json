Recent advances in the numerical approximation of high-dimensional probability distributions allow us to successfully estimate mutual information from scarce fMRI data. We also show that selecting voxels based on the multivariate mutual information of local activity patterns with respect to ground truth labels leads to higher decoding accuracy than established voxel selection methods. We validate our approach with a 6-way scene categorization fMRI experiment. Multivariate information analysis is able to find strong information sharing between PPA and RSC, consistent with existing neuroscience studies on scenes. Furthermore, an exploratory whole-brain analysis uncovered other brain regions that share information with the PPA-RSC scene network.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Barry Chai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chai:Barry", "Dirk B.
