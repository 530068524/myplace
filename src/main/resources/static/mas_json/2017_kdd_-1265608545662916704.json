A Robust Concept Exploration Method (RCEM) is developed to improve efficiency and effectiveness while making these early design decisions. An integrated design process is used to introduce quality consideration into the choice of robust top-level design specifications. This is achieved by integrating Taguchi's robust design principles and the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) into one multiobjective mathematical construct, namely, the compromise Decision Support Problem. The proposed approach is demonstrated for determining top-level specifications for airframe geometry and the propulsion system in the design of an integrated airframe/propulsion High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) system. The focus in this paper is on illustrating the approach rather than on the results per se.", "citation": "Citations (174)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Florida State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Allen Institute for Brain Science", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Samsung", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Kyungpook National University", "Kyungpook National University", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Spo\u0142eczna Akademia Nauk", "MIS, UPJV, 33 R ...
