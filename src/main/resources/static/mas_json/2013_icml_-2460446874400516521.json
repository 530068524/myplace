{"title": "Scalable Optimization of Neighbor Embedding for Visualization.", "fields": ["center of mass", "recursion", "big data", "embedding", "data visualization"], "abstract": "Neighbor embedding (NE) methods have found their use in data visualization but are limited in big data analysis tasks due to their O(n2) complexity for n data samples. We demonstrate that the obvious approach of subsampling produces inferior results and propose a generic approximated optimization technique that reduces the NE optimization cost to O(n log n). The technique is based on realizing that in visualization the embedding space is necessarily very low-dimensional (2D or 3D), and hence efficient approximations developed for n-body force calculations can be applied. In gradient-based NE algorithms the gradient for an individual point decomposes into \"forces\" exerted by the other points. The contributions of close-by points need to be computed individually but far-away points can be approximated by their \"center of mass\", rapidly computable by applying a recursive decomposition of the visualization space into quadrants. The new algorithm brings a significant speed-up for medium-size data, and brings \"big data\" within reach of visualization.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Aalto University", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "University of Helsinki"], "authors": ["Zhirong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhirong", "Jaakko Peltonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peltonen:Jaakko", "Samuel Kaski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaski:Samuel"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
