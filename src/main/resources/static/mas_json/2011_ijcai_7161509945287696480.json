The manual creation of a broad-coverage synset base is a time-consuming task, so we take advantage of dictionary definitions for extracting synonymy pairs and clustering for identifying synsets. Since word senses are not discrete, we create fuzzy synsets, where each word has a membership degree. We report on the results of the creation of a fuzzy synset base for Portuguese, from three electronic dictionaries. The resulting resource is larger than existing hancrafted Portuguese thesauri.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Coimbra", "University of Coimbra"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Hugo Gon\u00e7alo Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:Hugo_Gon=ccedil=alo", "Paulo Gomes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gomes:Paulo"], "pages": 6}
