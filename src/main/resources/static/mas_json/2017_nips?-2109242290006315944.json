This paper presents a novel approach for predicting contours which advances the state of the art in two fundamental aspects, i.e. multi-scale feature generation and fusion. Different from previous works directly considering multi-scale feature maps obtained from the inner layers of a primary CNN architecture, we introduce a hierarchical deep model which produces more rich and complementary representations. Furthermore, to refine and robustly fuse the representations learned at different scales, the novel Attention-Gated Conditional Random Fields (AG-CRFs) are proposed. The experiments ran on two publicly available datasets (BSDS500 and NYUDv2) demonstrate the effectiveness of the latent AG-CRF model and of the overall hierarchical framework.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Trento", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "fondazione bruno kessler", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Dan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0002:Dan", "Wanli Ouyang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouyang:Wanli", "Xavier Alameda-Pineda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alameda=Pineda:Xavier", "Elisa Ricci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ricci_0001:Elisa", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang", "Nicu Sebe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebe:Nicu"], "pages": 10}
