{"title": "Semi-supervised Clustering in Attributed Heterogeneous Information Networks.", "fields": ["single linkage clustering", "correlation clustering", "constrained clustering", "flame clustering", "fuzzy clustering"], "abstract": "A heterogeneous information network (HIN) is one whose nodes model objects of different types and whose links model objects' relationships. In many applications, such as social networks and RDF-based knowledge bases, information can be modeled as HINs. To enrich its information content, objects (as represented by nodes) in an HIN are typically associated with additional attributes. We call such an HIN an Attributed HIN or AHIN. We study the problem of clustering objects in an AHIN, taking into account objects' similarities with respect to both object attribute values and their structural connectedness in the network. We show how supervision signal, expressed in the form of a must-link set and a cannot-link set, can be leveraged to improve clustering results. We put forward the SCHAIN algorithm to solve the clustering problem. We conduct extensive experiments comparing SCHAIN with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms and show that SCHAIN outperforms the others in clustering quality.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "University of Hong Kong", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Xiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiang", "Yao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yao", "Martin Ester.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ester:Martin", "Ben Kao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kao:Ben", "Xin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0019:Xin", "Yudian Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yudian"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
