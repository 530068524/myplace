Its queries involve complex aggregations and navigations (joins) that touch large data volumes, which is typical in BI workloads, yet they depend heavily on graph functionality such as connectivity tests and path finding. We outline the motivation for this new benchmark, which we derived from many interactions with the graph database industry and its users, and situate it in a scenario of social network analysis. The workload was designed by taking into account technical \"chokepoints\" identified by database system architects from academia and industry, which we also describe and map to the queries. We present reference implementations in openCypher, PGQL, SPARQL, and SQL, and preliminary results of SNB BI on a number of graph data management systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Google", "National Chengchi University", "ON Semiconductor", "Sparsity Techno ... es and DAMA UPC", "Neo4j", "DLR and SAP SE"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Quoc Trung Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran:Quoc_Trung", "Konstantinos Morfonios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morfonios:Konstantinos", "Neoklis Polyzotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polyzotis:Neoklis"], "pages": 13}
