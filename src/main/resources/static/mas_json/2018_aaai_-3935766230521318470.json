{"title": "Order-Free RNN With Visual Attention for Multi-Label Classification.", "fields": ["beam search", "multi label classification", "closed captioning", "recurrent neural network", "visual objects"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the joint learning attention and recurrent neural network (RNN) models for multi-label classification. While approaches based on the use of either model exist (e.g., for the task of image captioning), training such existing network architectures typically require pre-defined label sequences. For multi-label classification, it would be desirable to have a robust inference process, so that the prediction error would not propagate and thus affect the performance. Our proposed model uniquely integrates attention and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, which not only addresses the above problem but also allows one to identify visual objects of interests with varying sizes without the prior knowledge of particular label ordering. More importantly, label co-occurrence information can be jointly exploited by our LSTM model. Finally, by advancing the technique of beam search, prediction of multiple labels can be efficiently achieved by our proposed network model.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Center for Information Technology"], "authors": ["Shang-Fu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shang=Fu", "Yi-Chen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yi=Chen", "Chih-Kuan Yeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeh:Chih=Kuan", "Yu-Chiang Frank Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yu=Chiang_Frank"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
