Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are effective at checking satisfiability of the ground fragment of LRA, but applying them to quantified formulas requires a costly quantifier elimination step. This article presents a novel decision procedure for LRA that leverages SMT solvers for the ground fragment of LRA, but avoids explicit quantifier elimination. The intuition behind the algorithm stems from an interpretation of a quantified formula as a game between two players, whose goals are to prove that the formula is either satisfiable or not. The algorithm synthesizes a winning strategy for one of the players by iteratively improving candidate strategies for both. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed procedure is competitive with existing solvers.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Princeton University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Azadeh Farzan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farzan:Azadeh", "Zachary Kincaid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kincaid:Zachary"], "pages": 9}
