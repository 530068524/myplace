{"title": "Multiple Hypothesis Tracking Revisited.", "fields": ["regularized least squares", "computer vision", "pattern recognition", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This paper revisits the classical multiple hypotheses tracking (MHT) algorithm in a tracking-by-detection framework. The success of MHT largely depends on the ability to maintain a small list of potential hypotheses, which can be facilitated with the accurate object detectors that are currently available. We demonstrate that a classical MHT implementation from the 90's can come surprisingly close to the performance of state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets. In order to further utilize the strength of MHT in exploiting higher-order information, we introduce a method for training online appearance models for each track hypothesis. We show that appearance models can be learned efficiently via a regularized least squares framework, requiring only a few extra operations for each hypothesis branch. We obtain state-of-the-art results on popular tracking-by-detection datasets such as PETS and the recent MOT challenge.", "citation": "Citations (141)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Oregon State University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Chanho Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Chanho", "Fuxin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fuxin", "Arridhana Ciptadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciptadi:Arridhana", "James M.
