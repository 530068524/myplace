{"title": "Combining Referring Expression Generation and Surface Realization: A Corpus-Based Investigation of Architectures.", "fields": ["german articles", "linearization", "referring expression generation", "architecture", "syntax"], "abstract": "We suggest a generation task that integrates discourse-level referring expression generation and sentence-level surface realization. We present a data set of German articles annotated with deep syntax and referents, including some types of implicit referents. Our experiments compare several architectures varying the order of a set of trainable modules. The results suggest that a revision-based pipeline, with intermediate linearization, significantly outperforms standard pipelines or a parallel architecture.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sina Zarrie\u00df.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zarrie=szlig=:Sina", "Jonas Kuhn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhn:Jonas"], "pages": 11}
