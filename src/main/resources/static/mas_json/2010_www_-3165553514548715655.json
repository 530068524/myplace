The framework facilitates dynamic partitioning of the screen real estate into virtual screens assigned for multiple concurrent web applications. The framework is utilized in the implementation of so-called UBI-hotspot, which provides various information services via different interaction modalities including mobile. The framework facilitates seamless integration of third party web applications residing anywhere in the public Internet into the UBI-hotspot, thus catering for a scalable and open architecture. We report the deployment of a network of indoor and outdoor UBI-hotspots at downtown Oulu, Finland. The quantitative data on the usage of the UBI-hotspots implicitly speaks in favor of the practical applicability of the framework.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Tomas Lind\u00e9n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lind=eacute=n:Tomas", "Tommi Heikkinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heikkinen:Tommi", "Timo Ojala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ojala:Timo", "Hannu Kukka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kukka:Hannu", "Marko Jurmu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurmu:Marko"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
