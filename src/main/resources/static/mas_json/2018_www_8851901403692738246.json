{"title": "Dynamic Mechanism Design in the Field.", "fields": ["incentive compatibility", "bounded function", "common value auction", "regret", "revenue"], "abstract": "Dynamic mechanisms are a powerful technique in designing revenue-maximizing repeated auctions. Despite their strength, these types of mechanisms have not been widely adopted in practice for several reasons, e.g., for their complexity, and for their sensitivity to the accuracy of predicting buyers\u2019 value distributions. In this paper, we aim to address these shortcomings and develop simple dynamic mechanisms that can be implemented efficiently, and provide theoretical guidelines for decreasing the sensitivity of dynamic mechanisms on the prediction accuracy of buyers\u2019 value distributions. We prove that the dynamic mechanism we propose is provably dynamic incentive compatible, and introduce a notion of buyers\u2019 regret in dynamic mechanisms, and show that our mechanism achieves bounded regret while improving revenue and social welfare compared to a static reserve pricing policy. Finally, we confirm our theoretical analysis via an extensive empirical study of our dynamic auction on real data sets from online adverting. For example, we show our dynamic mechanisms can provide a +17% revenue lift with relative regret less than 0.2%.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Cornell University", "Google", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Vahab S.
