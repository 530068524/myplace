[7] recently proposed a new framework -- termed  Generalized Universal Composability (GUC) -- for properly analyzing concurrent execution of cryptographic protocols in the presence of a global setup, and constructed the first known GUC-secure implementations of commitment (GUCC) and zero-knowledge (GUC ZK), which suffice to implement any two-party or multi-party functionality under several natural and relatively mild setup assumptions. Unfortunately, the feasibility results of [7] used rather inefficient constructions.\n\nIn this paper, we dramatically improve the efficiency of (adaptively-secure) GUCC and GUC ZK assuming data erasures are allowed. Namely, using the same minimal setup assumptions as those used by [7], we build\n\n\na direct and efficient constant-round GUC ZK for  R from any \"dense\"  i\u00be? -protocol [21] for  R . As a corollary, we get a semi-efficient construction from any  \u03a3 -protocol for  R ( without doing the Cook-Levin reduction ), and a very efficient GUC ZK for proving knowledge of a discrete log representation.\nthe first  constant-rate (and constant-round) GUCC scheme.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we show how to properly model a random oracle in the GUC framework without losing  deniability , which is one of the attractive features of the GUC framework. In particular, by adding the random oracle to the setup assumptions used by [7], we build the first two-round (which we show is optimal), deniable, straight-line extractable and simulatable ZK proof for any NP relation  R .", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "Google"], "authors": ["Yevgeniy Dodis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodis:Yevgeniy", "Victor Shoup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shoup:Victor", "Shabsi Walfish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walfish:Shabsi"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 21}
