{"title": "Deterministic distributed edge-coloring with fewer colors.", "fields": ["natural barrier", "binary logarithm", "edge coloring", "degree", "vizing s theorem"], "abstract": "We present a deterministic distributed algorithm, in the LOCAL model, that computes a (1+ o (1))\u0394-edge-coloring in polylogarithmic-time, so long as the maximum degree \u0394=\u03a9(log n ). For smaller \u0394, we give a polylogarithmic-time 3\u0394/2-edge-coloring. These are the first deterministic algorithms to go below the natural barrier of 2\u0394\u22121 colors, and they improve significantly on the recent polylogarithmic-time (2\u0394\u22121)(1+ o (1))-edge-coloring of Ghaffari and Su [SODA\u201917] and the (2\u0394\u22121)-edge-coloring of Fischer, Ghaffari, and Kuhn [FOCS\u201917], positively answering the main open question of the latter. The key technical ingredient of our algorithm is a simple and novel gradual packing of judiciously chosen near-maximum matchings, each of which becomes one of the color classes.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mohsen Ghaffari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghaffari:Mohsen", "Fabian Kuhn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhn:Fabian", "Yannic Maus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maus:Yannic", "Jara Uitto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uitto:Jara"], "pages": 13}
