In order to let a person easily know whether he is in strict compliance with the doctor's exercise prescription and adjust his exercise amount accordingly, we can use a smart-phone based activity reporting system to accurately recognize a range of daily activities and report the duration of each activity. A triaxial accelerometer embedded in the smart phone is used for the classification of several activities, such as staying still, walking, running, and going upstairs and downstairs. The model learnt from a specific person often cannot yield accurate results when used on a different person. To solve the cross-people activity recognition problem, we propose an algorithm known as TransEMDT (Transfer learning EMbedded Decision Tree) that integrates a decision tree and the k-means clustering algorithm for personalized activity-recognition model adaptation. Tested on a real-world data set, the results show that our algorithm outperforms several traditional baseline algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nanyang Technological University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhongtang Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhongtang", "Yiqiang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yiqiang", "Junfa Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Junfa", "Zhiqi Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Zhiqi", "Mingjie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Mingjie"], "pages": 6}
