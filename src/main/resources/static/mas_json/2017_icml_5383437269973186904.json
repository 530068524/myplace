{"title": "Analysis and Optimization of Graph Decompositions by Lifted Multicuts.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "graph", "polytope", "mathematics", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "We study the set of all decompositions (clusterings) of a graph through its characterization as a set of lifted multicuts. This leads us to practically relevant insights related to the definition of a class of decompositions by must-join and must-cut constraints and related to the comparison of clusterings by metrics. To find optimal decompositions defined by minimum cost lifted multicuts, we establish some properties of some facets of lifted multicut polytopes, define efficient separation procedures and apply these in a branch-and-cut algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Andrea Horn\u00e1kov\u00e1.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horn=aacute=kov=aacute=:Andrea", "Jan-Hendrik Lange.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lange:Jan=Hendrik", "Bjoern Andres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andres:Bjoern"], "pages": 10}
