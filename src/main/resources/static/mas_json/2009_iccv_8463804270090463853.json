Our learning framework is based on variational mode learning and allows us to efficiently optimize a continuous pedestrian cost model. We show that this model can be trained on automatic tracking results, and provides realistic and accurate pedestrian motions.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Paul Scovanner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scovanner:Paul", "Marshall F.
