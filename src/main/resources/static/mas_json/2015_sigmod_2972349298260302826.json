{"title": "The Minimum Wiener Connector Problem.", "fields": ["distance", "special case", "graph center", "wiener index", "path graph"], "abstract": "The Wiener index of a graph is the sum of all pairwise shortest-path distances between its vertices. In this paper we study the novel problem of finding a  minimum Wiener connector : given a connected graph  G=(V,E)  and a set  Q  \u2286  V  of query vertices, find a subgraph of  G  that connects all query vertices and has minimum Wiener index.   We show that MIN WIENER CONNECTOR admits a polynomial-time (albeit impractical) exact algorithm for the special case where the number of query vertices is bounded. We show that in general the problem is  NP -hard, and has no PTAS unless  P  =  NP . Our main contribution is a constant-factor approximation algorithm running in time  O(|Q||E|) .   A thorough experimentation on a large variety of real-world graphs confirms that our method returns smaller and denser solutions than other methods, and does so by adding to the query set  Q  a small number of ``important'' vertices (i.e., vertices with high  centrality ).", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Boston University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Natali Ruchansky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruchansky:Natali", "Francesco Bonchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonchi:Francesco", "David Garc\u00eda-Soriano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garc=iacute=a=Soriano:David", "Francesco Gullo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gullo:Francesco", "Nicolas Kourtellis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kourtellis:Nicolas"], "pages": 16}
