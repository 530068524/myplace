{"title": "Apex: automatic programming assignment error explanation.", "fields": ["implementation", "apex", "predicate", "the symbolic", "equivalence"], "abstract": "This paper presents Apex, a system that can automatically generate explanations for programming assignment bugs, regarding where the bugs are and how the root causes led to the runtime failures. It works by comparing the passing execution of a correct implementation (provided by the instructor) and the failing execution of the buggy implementation (submitted by the student). The technique overcomes a number of technical challenges caused by syntactic and semantic differences of the two implementations. It collects the symbolic traces of the executions and matches assignment statements in the two execution traces by reasoning about symbolic equivalence. It then matches predicates by aligning the control dependences of the matched assignment statements, avoiding direct matching of path conditions which are usually quite different. Our evaluation shows that Apex is every effective for 205 buggy real world student submissions of 4 programming assignments, and a set of 15 programming assignment type of buggy programs collected from stackoverflow.com, precisely pinpointing the root causes and capturing the causality for 94.5% of them. The evaluation on a standard benchmark set with over 700 student bugs shows similar results. A user study in the classroom shows that Apex has substantially improved student productivity.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Dohyeong Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Dohyeong", "Yonghwi Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Yonghwi", "Peng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0010:Peng", "I Luk Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:I_Luk", "David Mitchel Perry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perry:David_Mitchel", "Xiangyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Xiangyu", "Gustavo Rodriguez-Rivera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodriguez=Rivera:Gustavo"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2016", "pages": 17}
