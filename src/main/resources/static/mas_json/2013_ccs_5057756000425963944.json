{"title": "An architecture for practical actively secure MPC with dishonest majority.", "fields": ["latency", "computer security", "thread", "secure two party computation", "business", "preprocessor", "computation", "telecommunications", "architecture"], "abstract": "We present a runtime environment for executing secure programs via a multi-party computation protocol in the preprocessing model. The runtime environment is general and allows arbitrary reactive computations to be performed. A particularly novel aspect is that it automatically determines the minimum number of rounds needed for a computation, given a specific instruction sequence, and it then uses this to minimize the overall cost of the computation. Various experiments are reported on, on various non-trivial functionalities. We show how, by utilizing the ability of modern processors to execute multiple threads at a time, one can obtain various tradeoffs between latency and throughput", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Marcel Keller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keller:Marcel", "Peter Scholl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholl:Peter", "Nigel P.
