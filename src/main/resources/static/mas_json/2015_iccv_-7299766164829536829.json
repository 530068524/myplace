We propose to use cascaded regression with incremental learning to track generic objects without any prior knowledge of an object's structure or appearance. We exploit the spatial constraints between parts by implicitly learning the shape and deformation parameters of the object in an online fashion. We integrate a multiple temporal scale motion model to initialise our cascaded regression search close to the target and to allow it to cope with occlusions. Experimental results show that our tracker ranks first on the CVPR 2013 Benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Xiaomeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaomeng", "Michel F.
