By clustering the centers in the initial stage, and leveraging efficiently maintained lower and upper bounds between a point and centers, it more effectively avoids unnecessary distance calculations than prior algorithms. It significantly outperforms prior K-means algorithms consistently across all experimented data sets, cluster numbers, and machine configurations. The consistent, superior performance--plus its simplicity, user-control of overheads, and guarantee in producing the same clustering results as the standard K-means--makes Yinyang K-means a drop-in replacement of the classic K-means with an order of magnitude higher performance.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yufei Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Yufei", "Yue Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yue", "Xipeng Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xipeng", "Madanlal Musuvathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Musuvathi:Madanlal", "Todd Mytkowicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mytkowicz:Todd"], "pages": 9}
