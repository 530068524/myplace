The principle is to first pretend that the source case to be adapted solves the current target case. This may raise some contradictions with the specification of the target case and with the domain knowledge. The adaptation consists then in repairing these contradictions. This adaptation algorithm is based on an extension of the classical tableau method used for deductive inferences in ALC.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Julien Cojan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cojan:Julien", "Jean Lieber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lieber:Jean"], "pages": 8}
