{"title": "Bbs: A Phase-Bounded Model Checker for Asynchronous Programs.", "fields": ["queue", "bounded function", "model checking", "asynchronous communication", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "A popular model of asynchronous programming consists of a single-threaded worker process interacting with a task queue. In each step of such a program, the worker takes a task from the queue and executes its code atomically to completion. Executing a task can call \u201cnormal\u201d functions as well as post additional asynchronous tasks to the queue. Additionally, tasks can be posted to the queue by the environment.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["MPI-SWS", "MPI-SWS"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Rupak Majumdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majumdar:Rupak", "Zilong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zilong"], "pages": 8}
