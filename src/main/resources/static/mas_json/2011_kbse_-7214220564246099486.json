They are expected to run on a diverse set of platforms while interoperating with a wide variety of other applications. Although there have been advances in the discipline of software engineering, software faults, and malicious attacks still regularly cause system downtime [1]. Downtime of critical applications can create additional work, cause delays, and lead to financial loss [2]. This paper presents a computational geometry technique to tackle the problem of timely failure diagnosis during the execution of a software application. Our approach to failure diagnosis involves collecting a set of software metrics and building a geometric enclosures corresponding to known classes of faults. The geometric enclosures are then used to partition the state space defined by the metrics", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "authors": ["Edward Stehle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stehle:Edward", "Kevin Lynch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lynch:Kevin", "Maxim Shevertalov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shevertalov:Maxim", "Chris Rorres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rorres:Chris", "Spiros Mancoridis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancoridis:Spiros"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
