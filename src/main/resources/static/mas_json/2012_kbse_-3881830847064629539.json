{"title": "Weave droid: aspect-oriented programming on Android devices: fully embedded or in the cloud.", "fields": ["cloud computing", "android", "aspect oriented programming", "mobile device", "compiler"], "abstract": "Weave Droid is an Android application that makes Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) on Android devices possible and user-friendly. It allows to retrieve applications and aspects and weave them together in several ways. Applications and aspects can be loaded from Google Play, personal repositories, or the local memory of a device. Then, two complementary weaving modes are provided: local or remote, using the embedded aspect compiler or the compiler in the cloud, respectively. This provides flexibility and preserves the mobility of the target devices. Weave Droid opens a world of possible applications, not only by benefiting from the already existing uses of AOP on standard machines, but also by the various uses related to the mobile devices. Effectiveness of Weave Droid is demonstrated by weaving aspects with off-the-shelf applications from Google Play.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["UJF-Grenoble 1, ... e / LIG, France", "UJF-Grenoble 1, ... e / LIG, France"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Yli\u00e8s Falcone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Falcone:Yli=egrave=s", "Sebastian Currea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Currea:Sebastian"], "pages": 4}
