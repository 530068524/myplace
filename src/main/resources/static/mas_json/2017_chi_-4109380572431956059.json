{"title": "Video Consumption Patterns for First Time Smartphone Users: Community Health Workers in Lesotho.", "fields": ["information dissemination", "community health", "novelty", "software deployment", "popularity"], "abstract": "There is already strong evidence that mobile videos are a good vehicle for public health information dissemination, but there remain open questions around sustainability, appropriate target users, consumption patterns, content, and usage models. We analyse log and interview data of 42 community health workers (who were first time smartphone users) from a longitudinal 17-month deployment to better understand how the utility of mobile videos played out over time in rural Lesotho. During the study period, videos were viewed at an average of 170 times per month, for a total of 2898 views. Through this data we draw these primary findings: a) pausing is not contextually necessary, b) age is not a barrier to usage, c) the primary predictor of popularity of a given video is topical relevance and national campaigns, d) there is no apparent relationship between video length, popularity and completion rates, and e) new videos have only a short-lived novelty effect. Furthermore, we affirm that regular engagement with CHWs has an impact on continued usage, in addition to being important for reducing attrition due to technical issues.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Cape Town", "University of Cape Town", "University of Cape Town"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Maletsabisa Molapo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Molapo:Maletsabisa", "Melissa Densmore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Densmore:Melissa", "Brian DeRenzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeRenzi:Brian"], "pages": 12}
