{"title": "SAGE: A logical and physical design tool for entity-group based new SQL systems.", "fields": ["physical design", "logical conjunction", "database transaction", "benchmark", "sql"], "abstract": "Entity-group based new SQL systems achieve scalability and consistency at the same time by using a key-value store as the storage layer and limiting each transaction's boundary to a collection of data (called an entity-group). Examples of such systems are Google's Megastore, NEC's Partiqle, and LinkedIn's Espresso. Application developers of such systems face tremendous challenges, both in designing entity-groups (and hence transaction boundaries) and physical layout of data in key-value stores. Entity-group designs directly impact consistency semantics of the workload, and physical layout impacts the application throughput. Both problems are challenging for users to solve manually. In this demonstration, we show a system that solves both problems with a user-friendly GUI built on our principled formal methods. We demonstrate the system using a simple Auction benchmark, and a more complex TPC-W benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Bin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Bin", "Wang-Pin Hsiung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsiung:Wang=Pin", "Jun'ichi Tatemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tatemura:Jun=ichi", "Hakan Hacig\u00fcm\u00fcs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hacig=uuml=m=uuml=s:Hakan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
