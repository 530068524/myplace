Analogous to how online algorithms receive their input piece-by-piece, our model presents one of the players, Bob, his input piece-by-piece, and has the players Alice and Bob cooperate to compute a result each time before the next piece is revealed to Bob. This model has a closer and more natural correspondence to dynamic data structures than classic communication models do, and hence presents a new perspective on data structures.    We first present a tight lower bound for the  online set intersection  problem in the online communication model, demonstrating a general approach for proving online communication lower bounds. The online communication model prevents a batching trick that classic communication complexity allows, and yields a stronger lower bound. We then apply the online communication model to prove data structure lower bounds for two dynamic data structure problems: the Group Range problem and the Dynamic Connectivity problem for forests. Both of the problems admit a worst case  O (log n )-time data structure. Using online communication complexity, we prove a tight cell-probe lower bound for each: spending  o (log n ) (even amortized) time per operation results in at best an exp(\u2212\u03b4 2   n ) probability of correctly answering a (1/2+\u03b4)-fraction of the  n  queries.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Stanford University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Josh Alman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alman:Josh", "Joshua R.
