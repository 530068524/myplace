{"title": "SeLoger: A Tool for Graph-Based Reasoning in Separation Logic.", "fields": ["logical consequence", "linked list", "pointer", "semantic reasoner", "separation logic"], "abstract": "This paper introduces the tool SeLoger, which is a reasoner for satisfiability and entailment in a fragment of separation logic with pointers and linked lists. SeLoger builds upon and extends graph-based algorithms that have recently been introduced in order to settle both decision problems in polynomial time. Running SeLoger on standard benchmarks shows that the tool outperforms current state-of-the-art tools by orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "Microsoft", "University of Oxford", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Christoph Haase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haase:Christoph", "Samin Ishtiaq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishtiaq:Samin", "Jo\u00ebl Ouaknine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouaknine:Jo=euml=l", "Matthew J.
