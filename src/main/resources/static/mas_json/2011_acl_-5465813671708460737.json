Past work has used web counts to help resolve isolated ambiguities, such as binary noun-verb PP attachments and noun compound bracketings. In this work, we first present a method for generating web count features that address the full range of syntactic attachments. These features encode both surface evidence of lexical affinities as well as paraphrase-based cues to syntactic structure. We then integrate our features into full-scale dependency and constituent parsers. We show relative error reductions of 7.0% over the second-order dependency parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006), 9.2% over the constituent parser of Petrov et al. (2006), and 3.4% over a non-local constituent reranker.", "citation": "Citations (39)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mohit Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Mohit", "Dan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Dan"], "pages": 10}
