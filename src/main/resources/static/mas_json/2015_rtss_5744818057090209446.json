{"title": "EPC: Extended Path Coverage for Measurement-Based Probabilistic Timing Analysis.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "representativeness heuristic", "static timing analysis", "trustworthiness", "basic block"], "abstract": "Measurement-based probabilistic timing analysis (MBPTA) computes trustworthy upper bounds to the execution time of software programs. MBPTA has the connotation, typical of measurement-based techniques, that the bounds computed with it only relate to what is observed in actual program traversals, which may not include the effective worst-case phenomena. To overcome this limitation, we propose Extended Path Coverage (EPC), a novel technique that allows extending the representativeness of the bounds computed by MBPTA. We make the observation data probabilistically path-independent by modifying the probability distribution of the observed timing behaviour so as to negatively compensate for any benefits that a basic block may draw from a path leading to it. This enables the derivation of trustworthy upper bounds to the probabilistic execution time of all paths in the program, even when the user-provided input vectors do not exercise the worst-case path. Our results confirm that using MBPTA with EPC produces fully trustworthy upper bounds with competitively small overestimation in comparison to state-of-the-art MBPTA techniques.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Padua", "University of Padua", "University of Padua", "Spanish National Research Council", "Barcelona Super ... arcelona, Spain"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Marco Ziccardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Ziccardi:Marco", "Enrico Mezzetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mezzetti:Enrico", "Tullio Vardanega.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vardanega:Tullio", "Jaume Abella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abella:Jaume", "Francisco J.
