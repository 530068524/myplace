The approximation quality of the Nystrom method depends crucially on the number of selected landmark points and the selection procedure. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to compute the optimal Nystrom low-approximation when the number of landmark points exceed the target rank. Moreover, we introduce a randomized algorithm for generating landmark points that is scalable to large-scale data sets. The proposed method performs K-means clustering on low-dimensional random projections of a data set and, thus, leads to significant savings for high-dimensional data sets. Our theoretical results characterize the tradeoffs between the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance as well as the efficiency of our proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Colorado School of Mines"], "authors": ["Farhad Pourkamali Anaraki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anaraki:Farhad_Pourkamali", "Stephen Becker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Becker:Stephen", "Michael B.
