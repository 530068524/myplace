This problem of providing fairness in wireless networks is considered in the framework of non-linear optimization. We say a medium access control algorithm is proportionally fair with respect to individual end-to-end flows in a network, if the product of the end-to-end flow-success probabilities is maximized.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Nikhil Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Nikhil", "Ramavarapu S.
