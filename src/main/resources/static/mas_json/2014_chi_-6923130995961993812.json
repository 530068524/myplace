Accelerometers have been used in movement recognition systems, but rarely to assess expressive qualities of movement. We present a prototype of wearable system for the real-time detection and classification of movement quality using acceleration data. The system applies Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) to recognize Laban Effort qualities from acceleration input using a Machine Learning software that generates classifications in real time. Existing LMA-recognition systems rely on motion capture data and video data, and can only be deployed in controlled settings. Our single-accelerometer system is portable and can be used under a wide range of environmental conditions. We evaluate the performance of the system, present two applications using the system in the digital arts and discuss future directions.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Diego Silang Maranan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maranan:Diego_Silang", "Sarah Fdili Alaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alaoui:Sarah_Fdili", "Thecla Schiphorst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiphorst:Thecla", "Philippe Pasquier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasquier:Philippe", "Pattarawut Subyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subyen:Pattarawut", "Lyn Bartram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartram:Lyn"], "pages": 10}
