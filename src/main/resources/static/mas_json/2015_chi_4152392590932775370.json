To understand users' touch behavior on large mobile touchscreens, we conducted an empirical experiment to discover their usage patterns of tilting devices toward their thumbs to touch screen regions. Exploiting this natural tilting behavior, we designed three novel mobile interaction techniques: TiltSlide, TiltReduction, and TiltCursor. We conducted a controlled experiment to compare our methods with other existing methods, and then evaluated them in real mobile phone scenarios such as sending an e-mail and web surfing. We constructed a design space for one-hand targeting interactions and proposed design considerations for one-hand targeting in real mobile phone circumstances.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Youli Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Youli", "Sehi L'Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=Yi:Sehi", "Kyle Koh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koh:Kyle", "Jinwook Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Jinwook"], "pages": 10}
