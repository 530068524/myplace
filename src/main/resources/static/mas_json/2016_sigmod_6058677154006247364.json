Current LSH-based approaches target at the L1 and L2 spaces, while as shown in previous work, the fractional distance metrics (Lp metrics with 0", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yuxin Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yuxin", "Qi Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Qi", "Anthony K.
