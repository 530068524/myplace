{"title": "Estimating labels from label proportions.", "fields": ["unsupervised learning", "gaussian process", "filter", "uniform convergence", "estimator", "robot learning"], "abstract": "Consider the following problem: given sets of unlabeled observations, each set with known label proportions, predict the labels of another set of observations, possibly with known label proportions. This problem occurs in areas like e-commerce, politics, spam filtering and improper content detection. We present consistent estimators which can reconstruct the correct labels with high probability in a uniform convergence sense. Experiments show that our method works well in practice.", "citation": "Citations (142)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Novi Quadrianto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quadrianto:Novi", "Alexander J.
