A major challenge for research in General Game Playing is to endow a player with the ability to extract and prove game-specific knowledge from the mere game rules. We define a formal language to express temporally extended\u2014yet local\u2014properties of games. We also develop a provably correct proof theory for this language using the paradigm of Answer Set Programming, and we report on experiments with a practical implementation of this proof system in combination with a successful general game player.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Michael Thielscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thielscher:Michael", "Sebastian Voigt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voigt:Sebastian"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
