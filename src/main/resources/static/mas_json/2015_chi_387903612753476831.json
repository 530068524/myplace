{"title": "You Can't Smoke Here: Towards Support for Space Usage Rules in Location-aware Technologies.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "computer science", "data mining"], "abstract": "Recent work has identified the lack of space usage rule (SUR) data -- e.g. \"no smoking\", \"no campfires\" -- as an important limitation of online/mobile maps that presents risks to user safety and the environment. In order to address this limitation, a large-scale means of mapping SURs must be developed. In this paper, we introduce and motivate the problem of mapping space usage rules and take the first steps towards identifying solutions. We show how computer vision can be employed to identify SUR indicators in the environment (e.g. \"No Smoking\" signs) with reasonable accuracy and describe techniques that can assign each rule to the appropriate geographic feature.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Hasselt", "University of Minnesota", "University of Hasselt", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Pavel Andreevich Samsonov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samsonov:Pavel_Andreevich", "Xun Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xun", "Johannes Sch\u00f6ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=ning:Johannes", "Werner Kuhn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhn:Werner", "Brent J.
