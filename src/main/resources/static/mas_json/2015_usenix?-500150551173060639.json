{"title": "NVMKV: A Scalable, Lightweight, FTL-aware Key-Value Store.", "fields": ["associative array", "device file", "scalability", "nosql", "non blocking algorithm"], "abstract": "Key-value stores are ubiquitous in high performance data-intensive, scale out, and NoSQL environments. Many KV stores use flash devices for meeting their performance needs. However, by using flash as a simple block device, these KV stores are unable to fully leverage the powerful capabilities that exist within Flash Translation Layers (FTLs). NVMKV is a lightweight KV store that leverages native FTL capabilities such as sparse addressing, dynamic mapping, transactional persistence, and support for high-levels of lock free parallelism. Our evaluation of NVMKV demonstrates that it provides scalable, high-performance, and ACID compliant KV operations at close to raw device speeds.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Florida International University", "SanDisk", "SanDisk", "Florida International University"], "authors": ["Leonardo M\u00e1rmol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=aacute=rmol:Leonardo", "Swaminathan Sundararaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundararaman:Swaminathan", "Nisha Talagala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talagala:Nisha", "Raju Rangaswami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangaswami:Raju"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
