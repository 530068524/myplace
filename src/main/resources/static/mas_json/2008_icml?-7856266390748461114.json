{"title": "Learning diverse rankings with multi-armed bandits.", "fields": ["ranking", "ranking svm", "multi armed bandit", "learning to rank"], "abstract": "Algorithms for learning to rank Web documents usually assume a document's relevance is independent of other documents. This leads to learned ranking functions that produce rankings with redundant results. In contrast, user studies have shown that diversity at high ranks is often preferred. We present two online learning algorithms that directly learn a diverse ranking of documents based on users' clicking behavior. We show that these algorithms minimize abandonment, or alternatively, maximize the probability that a relevant document is found in the top  k  positions of a ranking. Moreover, one of our algorithms asymptotically achieves optimal worst-case performance even if users' interests change.", "citation": "Citations (366)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Filip Radlinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radlinski:Filip", "Robert Kleinberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleinberg:Robert", "Thorsten Joachims.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joachims:Thorsten"], "pages": 8}
