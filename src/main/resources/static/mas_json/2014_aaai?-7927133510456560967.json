In the context of ontology stream, diagnosis results are not captured by a unique fixed ontology but numerous time-evolving ontologies. Thus any anomaly can be diagnosed by a large number of different explanations depending on the version and evolution of the ontology. We address the problems of identifying, representing, exploiting and exploring the evolution of diagnoses representations. Our approach consists in a graph-based representation, which aims at (i) efficiently organizing and linking time-evolving diagnoses and (ii) being used for scalable exploration. The experiments have shown scalable diagnoses exploration in the context of real and live data from Dublin City.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["IBM"], "authors": ["Freddy L\u00e9cu\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=eacute=cu=eacute=:Freddy"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
