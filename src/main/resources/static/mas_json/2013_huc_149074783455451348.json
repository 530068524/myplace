Since physical load has a linear relationship with heart rate, our purpose is to estimate heart rate with a smartphone. To this end, we build heart rate prediction models which predict heart rate variation from walking data including acceleration and walking speed by machine learning. In order to track unexpected change of physical load, we focus attention on oxygen uptake which has a similar property to heart rate and devise a novel technique to estimate the oxygen uptake from acceleration and GPS data so that it is used as an input of the model. Moreover, to adapt to difference of heart rate variation among individuals, we devise techniques to optimize parameters for each profile-based category of users and to normalize heart rate to absorb individual difference. We applied the proposed method to actual walking data on various routes by different persons and confirmed that the method estimates heart rate variation with the mean error of less than 7 beat per minute.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Mayu Sumida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sumida:Mayu", "Teruhiro Mizumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mizumoto:Teruhiro", "Keiichi Yasumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yasumoto:Keiichi"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
