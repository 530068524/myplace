We use a non-cooperative bilateral connection game (BCG) framework to study network formation. For a BCG in which devices choose their individual strategies to remain connected by minimizing only their direct transmission power costs, we show that the price-of-anarchy is unbounded in the network size. We propose a BCG with an alternate cost structure in which each device additionally  pays  the transmission power costs incurred by other devices for its own traffic. We show that a unique network structure emerges in this game that is stable as well as socially efficient. We then study the achievable throughput for random point-to-point traffic in this stable energy-efficient network. When the nodes of a network are located in a bounded planar region the distribution of point- to-point flows through the nodes exhibits a scale-free behavior.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Hithesh Nama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nama:Hithesh", "Narayan B.
