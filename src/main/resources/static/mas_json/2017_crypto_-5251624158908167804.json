{"title": "Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol.", "fields": ["proof of stake", "nash equilibrium", "proof of work system", "blockchain", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We present \u201cOuroboros\u201d, the first blockchain protocol based on proof of stake with rigorous security guarantees. We establish security properties for the protocol comparable to those achieved by the bitcoin blockchain protocol. As the protocol provides a \u201cproof of stake\u201d blockchain discipline, it offers qualitative efficiency advantages over blockchains based on proof of physical resources (e.g., proof of work). We also present a novel reward mechanism for incentivizing Proof of Stake protocols and we prove that, given this mechanism, honest behavior is an approximate Nash equilibrium, thus neutralizing attacks such as selfish mining.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Connecticut", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "IOHK"], "authors": ["Aggelos Kiayias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiayias:Aggelos", "Alexander Russell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Russell:Alexander", "Bernardo David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/David:Bernardo", "Roman Oliynykov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliynykov:Roman"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 32}
