However, collecting high quality datasets is really laborious. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised framework for learning visual categories from Google Images. The 1st and 2nd order features, which define bag of words representation and spatial relationship between local features respectively, make up an independent and redundant feature split. We then integrate a cotraining algorithm CoBoost with these two features. We create two boosting classifiers based on the 1st and 2nd order features respectively in the training, during which one classifier provides labels for the other. Besides, the 2nd order features are generated dynamically rather than extracted exhaustively to avoid high computation. An active learning technique is also introduced to further improve the performance. We evaluate our method on the benchmark datasets, showing results competitive with the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and some supervised techniques.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Xi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xi", "Zhiping Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Zhiping", "Zhixin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhixin", "Zhongzhi Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Zhongzhi"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
