This growing number of models adds to the fact that it gets more and more difficult to organise, structure, and reuse them. Thereby new software development projects cannot profit from existing knowledge. In our research we will study existing natural language processing techniques for their adaptability in the reuse of software models. We will research methods to group existing models according to their functionality.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Leipzig University", "University Duis ...
