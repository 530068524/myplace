In contrast to the existing trackers using deep networks, the proposed tracker is designed to achieve a light computation as well as satisfactory tracking accuracy in both location and scale. The deep network to control actions is pre-trained using various training sequences and fine-tuned during tracking for online adaptation to target and background changes. The pre-training is done by utilizing deep reinforcement learning as well as supervised learning. The use of reinforcement learning enables even partially labeled data to be successfully utilized for semi-supervised learning. Through evaluation of the OTB dataset, the proposed tracker is validated to achieve a competitive performance that is three times faster than state-of-the-art, deep network\u2013based trackers. The fast version of the proposed method, which operates in real-time on GPU, outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time trackers.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sangdoo Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Sangdoo", "Jongwon Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jongwon", "Youngjoon Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Youngjoon", "Kimin Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Kimin", "Jin Young Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi_0002:Jin_Young"], "pages": 10}
