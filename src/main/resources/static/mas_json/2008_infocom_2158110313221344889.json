These phony sites imitate popular websites and try to extract personal information from unsuspecting users, or simply advertise and sell products to users. In this paper, we conduct a massive study in order to quantify the extent of this parasitic URL naming We start with a corpus of 900 popular websites, which we refer to as original URLs, and generate roughly 3 million URLs by varying the original names systematically and exhaustively. Over a period of 60 days, we analyze how many sites have URLs very similar to our original URLs. We find that parasitic URL naming is a wide-spread problem and quantify the extent of this issue. We believe that this work will provide the first step towards research and tools to combat web-fraud.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside"], "authors": ["Anirban Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Anirban", "Dhiman Barman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barman:Dhiman", "Michalis Faloutsos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faloutsos:Michalis", "Laxmi N.
