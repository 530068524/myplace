However, using multiple features for co-clustering images without any user feedbacks is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Semi-Supervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SS-NMF) framework for image co-clustering. Our method computes new relational matrices by incorporating user provided feedbacks into images through simultaneous distance metric learning and feature selection for different low-level visual features. Using an iterative algorithm, we perform tri-factorizations of the new matrices to infer image clusters. Theoretically, we show the convergence and correctness of SS-NMF co-clustering and the advantages of SS-NMF co-clustering over existing approaches. Through extensive experiments conducted on image data sets, we demonstrate that SS-NMF provides an effective and efficient solution for image co-clustering.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Wayne State University", "Wayne State University", "Shanghai University"], "authors": ["Yanhua Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yanhua", "Ming Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Ming", "Wanggen Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Wanggen"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
