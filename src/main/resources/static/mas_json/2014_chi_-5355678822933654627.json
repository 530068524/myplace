{"title": "Exploring percussive gesture on iPads with ensemble metatone.", "fields": ["vocabulary", "user experience design", "popularity", "musical", "gesture"], "abstract": "Percussionists are unique among western classical instrumentalists in that their artistic practice is defined by an approach to interaction rather than their instruments. While percussionists are accustomed to exploring non-traditional objects to create music, these objects have yet to encompass touch-screen computing devices to any great extent. The proliferation and popularity of these devices now presents an opportunity to explore their use in combining computer-generated sound together with percussive interaction in a musical ensemble.   This paper examines Ensemble Metatone, a group formed to explore the \"infiltration\" of iPad-based musical instruments into a free-improvisation percussion ensemble. We discuss the design approach for two different iPad percussion instruments and the methodology for exploring them with the group over a series of rehearsals and performances. Qualitative analysis of discussions throughout this process shows that the musicians developed a vocabulary of gestures and musical interactions to make musical sense of these new instruments.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Charles P.
