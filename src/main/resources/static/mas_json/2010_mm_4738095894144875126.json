Spatio-temporal features are exploited to capture scene dynamic statistics together with appearance. Anomaly detection is performed in a non-parametric fashion, evaluating directly local descriptor statistics. A method to update scene statistics, to cope with scene changes that typically happen in real world settings, is also provided. The proposed method is tested on publicly available datasets.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Florence", "University of Florence"], "authors": ["Lorenzo Seidenari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidenari:Lorenzo", "Marco Bertini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertini:Marco"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
