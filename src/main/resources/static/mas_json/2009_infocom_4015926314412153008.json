IP fast reroute (IPFRR) intends to fill this gap, providing fast, local and proactive handling of failures right in the IP layer. Building on experiences and extensive measurement results collected with a prototype implementation of the prevailing IPFRR technique, Not-via, in this paper we identify high address management burden and computational complexity as the major causes of why commercial IPFRR deployment still lags behind, and we present a lightweight not-via scheme, which, according to our measurements, improves these issues.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Ericsson"], "authors": ["G\u00e1bor Enyedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Enyedi:G=aacute=bor", "P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szil=aacute=gyi:P=eacute=ter", "G\u00e1bor R\u00e9tv\u00e1ri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=eacute=tv=aacute=ri:G=aacute=bor", "Andr\u00e1s Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cs=aacute=sz=aacute=r:Andr=aacute=s"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
