{"title": "Coarse-to-Fine Segmentation with Shape-Tailored Continuum Scale Spaces.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "scale space", "market segmentation", "scale space segmentation", "heat equation"], "abstract": "We formulate an energy for segmentation that is designed to have preference for segmenting the coarse over fine structure of the image, without smoothing across boundaries of regions. The energy is formulated by integrating a continuum of scales from a scale space computed from the heat equation within regions. We show that the energy can be optimized without computing a continuum of scales, but instead from a single scale. This makes the method computationally efficient in comparison to energies using a discrete set of scales. We apply our method to texture and motion segmentation. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that a continuum of scales leads to better segmentation accuracy over discrete scales and other competing methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "Chung-Ang University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Naeemullah Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Naeemullah", "Byung-Woo Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Byung=Woo", "Anthony J.
