While there are established research fields within HCI for visualizing specific use cases of a smart home, studies targeting user demands on visualizations spanning across multiple use cases are rare. Especially, individual data-related demands pose a challenge for usable visualizations. To investigate potentials of an end-user development (EUD) approach for flexibly supporting such demands, we developed a smart home system featuring both pre-defined visualizations and a visualization creation tool. To evaluate our concept, we installed our prototype in 12 households as part of a Living Lab study. Results are based on three interview studies, a design workshop and system log data. We identified eight overarching interests in home data and show how participants used pre-defined visualizations to get an overview and the creation tool to not only address specific use cases but also to answer questions by creating temporary visualizations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences", "University of Siegen", "Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences", "University of Siegen", "Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Nico Castelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castelli:Nico", "Corinna Ogonowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogonowski:Corinna", "Timo Jakobi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jakobi:Timo", "Martin Stein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stein:Martin", "Gunnar Stevens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stevens:Gunnar", "Volker Wulf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulf:Volker"], "pages": 14}
