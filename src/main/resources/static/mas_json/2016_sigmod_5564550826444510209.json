New supply forecasting methods are developed to better address this challenge, but meaningful benchmarks are rare and time-intensive. We propose the ECAST online platform in order to solve that problem. The system's capability is demonstrated on a real-world use case by comparing the performance of different prediction tools.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Robotron Datenb ... resden, Germany", "Robotron Datenb ... resden, Germany"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Robert Ulbricht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ulbricht:Robert", "Claudio Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartmann:Claudio", "Martin Hahmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hahmann:Martin", "Hilko Donker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donker:Hilko", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "pages": 4}
