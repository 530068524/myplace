In this paper we propose a novel\nmesh-based autoencoder architecture that is able to cope with\nmeshes with irregular topology. We introduce sparse regularization\nin this framework, which along with convolutional operations,\nhelps localize deformations. Our framework is capable\nof extracting localized deformation components from\nmesh data sets with large-scale deformations and is robust to\nnoise. It also provides a nonlinear approach to reconstruction\nof meshes using the extracted basis, which is more effective\nthan the current linear combination approach. Extensive experiments\nshow that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Tsinghua University", "Peking University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Qingyang Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Qingyang", "Lin Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0004:Lin", "Yu-Kun Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Yu=Kun", "Jie Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jie", "Shihong Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Shihong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
