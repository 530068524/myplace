Different environmental, agricultural and processing practices, as well as policies affect the contents of components in foods, which support the rationale for creation of national databases. However they are supplemented with data from other compatible databases. The data are available through different tools to end users for estimation of dietary intake, diet planning, food labelling, as most common. Databases updating and providing quality data on food from all stakeholders in the food chain is crucial in order to address the needs of users. However, they must be aware of certain constraints when working with databases such as source and traceability of nutritional data, representativeness of values, and comparability of values from different sources. The paper presents the results from comparison of the nutritional composition of selected foods and nine menus based on data from various food composition databases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Ljubljana", "University of Ljubljana"], "authors": ["Mojca Korosec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korosec:Mojca", "Jasna Bertoncelj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertoncelj:Jasna"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
