Due to the framework's modular architecture and its support for a large variety of broadcast standards, it enables the realization of a broad spectrum of prototype implementations and test setups in the context of Multimedia research and development. We describe three different example configurations for the generation of DVB-T and DVB-H streams that also support MHP applications for local interactivity.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["ftw.
