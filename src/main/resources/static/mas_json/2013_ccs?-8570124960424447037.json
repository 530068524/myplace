{"title": "PICCO: a general-purpose compiler for private distributed computation.", "fields": ["secure two party computation", "implementation", "secure multi party computation", "distributed computing environment", "secret sharing"], "abstract": "Secure computation on private data has been an active area of research for many years and has received a renewed interest with the emergence of cloud computing. In recent years, substantial progress has been made with respect to the efficiency of the available techniques and several implementations have appeared. The available tools, however, lacked a convenient mechanism for implementing a general-purpose}program in a secure computation framework suitable for execution in not fully trusted environments. This work fulfills this gap and describes a system, called PICCO, for converting a program written in an extension of C into its distributed secure implementation and running it in a distributed environment. The C extension preserves all current features of the programming language and allows variables to be marked as private and be used in general-purpose computation. Secure distributed implementation of compiled programs is based on linear secret sharing, achieving efficiency and information-theoretical security. Our experiments also indicate that many programs can be evaluated very efficiently on private data using PICCO.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Notre Dame", "University of Notre Dame", "University of Notre Dame"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Yihua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yihua", "Aaron Steele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steele:Aaron", "Marina Blanton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanton:Marina"], "pages": 14}
