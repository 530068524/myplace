However, they also suffer from well-known issues of precision, occlusion and an inability to isolate different degrees of freedom in spatial manipulations. We present a set of interactions, called Rock & Rails, that augment existing direct touch manipulations with shape-based gestures, thus providing on-demand gain control, occlusion avoidance, and separation of constraints in 2D manipulation tasks. Using shape gestures in combination with direct-manipulations allows us to do this without ambiguity in detection and without resorting to manipulation handles, which break the direct manipulation paradigm. Our set of interactions were evaluated by 8 expert graphic designers and were found to be easy to learn and master, as well as effective in accomplishing a precise graphical layout task.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Wigdor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigdor:Daniel", "Hrvoje Benko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benko:Hrvoje", "John Pella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pella:John", "Jarrod Lombardo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lombardo:Jarrod", "Sarah Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Sarah"], "pages": 10}
