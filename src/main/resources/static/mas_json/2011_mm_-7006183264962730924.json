The system consists of three steps: The first one involves a ground detection process that can detect relatively complex terrain and separate it from other objects. The second step superpixelizes the remaining objects to speed up the segmentation process. In the final step, a manifold embedded mode seeking method is adopted to segment the point clouds. Even though the segmentation of urban objects is a challenging problem in terms of accuracy and problem scale, our system can efficiently generate very good segmentation results. The proposed manifold learning effectively improves the segmentation performance due to the fact that continuous artificial objects often have manifold-like structures.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Zhiding Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Zhiding", "Chunjing Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chunjing", "Jianzhuang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jianzhuang", "Oscar C.
