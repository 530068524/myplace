{"title": "Creating a Sociotechnical API: Designing City-Scale Community Engagement.", "fields": ["community engagement", "civics", "sociotechnical system", "public engagement", "participatory design"], "abstract": "Community engagement is to cities what user experience is to computing: it signifies a large category that simultaneously speaks to general qualities of interaction and to specific ways of doing that interaction. Recently, digital civics has emerged as a research area with a comprehensive approach to designing for civic encounters where community engagement is a primary concern for designing systems and processes that support broad civic interaction. In short, over the past year, we worked with municipal officials, service providers, and city residents to design a community engagement playbook detailing best practices for city-scale engagement. The playbook, as well as the collaborative process that produced it, provides a roadmap for thinking through the kinds of systems that might populate the design space of city-scale digital civics. This paper details our design-led research process and builds on emerging literature on designing for digital civic interaction.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "IT University of Copenhagen", "Solidarity Rese ... ngeles, CA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mariam Asad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asad:Mariam", "Christopher A.
