{"title": "A Benes packet network.", "fields": ["network packet", "packet switching", "burst switching", "backpressure routing", "network traffic control"], "abstract": "Benes networks are constructed with simple switch modules and have many advantages, including small latency and requiring only an almost linear number of switch modules. As circuit-switches, Benes networks are rearrangeably non-blocking, which implies that they are full-throughput as packet switches, with suitable routing. Routing in Benes networks can be done by time-sharing permutations. However, this approach requires centralized control of the switch modules and statistical knowledge of the traffic arrivals. We propose a backpressure-based routing scheme for Benes networks, combined with end-to-end congestion control. This approach achieves the maximal utility of the network and requires only four queues per module, independently of the size of the network.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Longbo Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Longbo", "Jean C.
