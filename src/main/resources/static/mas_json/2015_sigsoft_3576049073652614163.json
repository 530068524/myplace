{"title": "Staged program repair with condition synthesis.", "fields": ["computer science", "parameterized complexity", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We present SPR, a new program repair system that combines staged program repair and condition synthesis. These techniques enable SPR to work productively with a set of parameterized transformation schemas to generate and efficiently search a rich space of program repairs. Together these techniques enable SPR to generate correct repairs for over five times as many defects as previous systems evaluated on the same benchmark set.", "citation": "Citations (161)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Fan Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Fan", "Martin Rinard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rinard:Martin"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
