This paper presents personalized course recommendation and curriculum design algorithms that exploit logged student data. The algorithms are based on the regression estimator for contextual multi-armed bandits with a penalized variance term. Guarantees on the predictive performance of the algorithms are provided using empirical Bernstein bounds. We also provide guidelines for including expert domain knowledge into the recommendations. Using undergraduate engineering logged data from a post-secondary institution we illustrate the performance of these algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["William Hoiles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoiles:William", "Mihaela van der Schaar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaar:Mihaela_van_der"], "pages": 9}
