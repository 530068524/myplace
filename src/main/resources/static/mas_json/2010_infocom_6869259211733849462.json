The prior work focuses on designing time-efficient algorithms that can estimate tens of thousands of tags in seconds. We observe that, for a RFID reader to access tags in a large area, active tags are likely to be used. These tags are batterypowered and use their own energy for information transmission. However, recharging batteries for tens of thousands of tags is laborious. Unlike the prior work, this paper studies the RFID estimation problem from the energy angle. Our goal is to reduce the amount of energy that is consumed by the tags during the estimation procedure. We design several energy-efficient probabilistic algorithms that iteratively refine a control parameter to optimize the information carried in the transmissions from the tags, such that both the number and the size of the transmissions are minimized.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0013:Tao", "Samuel S.
