{"title": "Relational Hash: Probabilistic Hash for Verifying Relations, Secure Against Forgery and More.", "fields": ["secure hash standard", "hash buster", "mdc 2", "sha 2", "hash list"], "abstract": "Traditional cryptographic hash functions allow one to easily check whether the original plaintexts are equal or not, given a pair of hash values. Probabilistic hash functions extend this concept where given a probabilistic hash of a value and the value itself, one can efficiently check whether the hash corresponds to the given value. However, given distinct probabilistic hashes of the same value it is not possible to check whether they correspond to the same value. In this work we introduce a new cryptographic primitive called Relational Hash using which, given a pair of (relational) hash values, one can determine whether the original plaintexts were related or not. We formalize various natural security notions for the Relational Hash primitive - one-wayness, twin one-wayness, unforgeability and oracle simulatibility.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Fujitsu", "Fujitsu"], "authors": ["Avradip Mandal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mandal:Avradip", "Arnab Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy_0003:Arnab"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
