{"title": "QuickRelease: A throughput-oriented approach to release consistency on GPUs.", "fields": ["release consistency", "coherence", "locality", "cuda pinned memory", "instruction set"], "abstract": "Graphics processing units (GPUs) have specialized throughput-oriented memory systems optimized for stream-ing writes with scratchpad memories to capture locality explicitly. Expanding the utility of GPUs beyond graphics encourages designs that simplify programming (e.g., using caches instead of scratchpads) and better support irregular applications with finer-grain synchronization. Our hypothe-sis is that, like CPUs, GPUs will benefit from caches and coherence, but that CPU-style \u201cread for ownership\u201d (RFO) coherence is inappropriate to maintain support for regular streaming workloads.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices"], "authors": ["Blake A.
