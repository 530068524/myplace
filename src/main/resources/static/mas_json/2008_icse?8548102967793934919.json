We choose one set of product related and one set of process related software metrics and use them for classifying Java files of the Eclipse project as defective respective defect-free. Classification models are built using three common machine learners: logistic regression, naive Bayes, and decision trees. To allow different costs for prediction errors we perform cost-sensitive classification, which proves to be very successful: >75% percentage of correctly classified files, a recall of >80%, and a false positive rate <30%. Results indicate that for the Eclipse data, process metrics are more efficient defect predictors than code metrics.", "citation": "Citations (471)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Free University ...
