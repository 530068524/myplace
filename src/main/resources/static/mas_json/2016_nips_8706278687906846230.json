{"title": "Efficient High-Order Interaction-Aware Feature Selection Based on Conditional Mutual Information.", "fields": ["conditional mutual information", "saddle point", "sample complexity", "feature selection", "binary number"], "abstract": "This study introduces a novel feature selection approach CMICOT, which is a further evolution of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) whose scoring functions are based on conditional mutual information (MI). We state and study a novel saddle point (max-min) optimization problem to build a scoring function that is able to identify joint interactions between several features. This method fills the gap of MI-based SFS techniques with high-order dependencies. In this high-dimensional case, the estimation of MI has prohibitively high sample complexity. We mitigate this cost using a greedy approximation and binary representatives what makes our technique able to be effectively used. The superiority of our approach is demonstrated by comparison with recently proposed interaction-aware filters and several interaction-agnostic state-of-the-art ones on ten publicly available benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Yandex", "Yandex", "Yandex"], "authors": ["Alexander Shishkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shishkin:Alexander", "Anastasia A.
