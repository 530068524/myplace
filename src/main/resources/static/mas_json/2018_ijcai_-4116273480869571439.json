{"title": "Improving Information Centrality of a Node in Complex Networks by Adding Edges.", "fields": ["greedy algorithm", "centrality", "binary logarithm", "resistance distance", "monotone polygon"], "abstract": "The problem of increasing the centrality of a network node arises in many practical applications. In this paper, we study the optimization problem of maximizing the information centrality $I_v$ of a given node $v$ in a network with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, by creating $k$ new edges incident to $v$. Since $I_v$ is the reciprocal of the sum of resistance distance $\\mathcal{R}_v$ between $v$ and all nodes, we alternatively consider the problem of minimizing $\\mathcal{R}_v$ by adding $k$ new edges linked to $v$. We show that the objective function is monotone and supermodular. We provide a simple greedy algorithm with an approximation factor $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)$ and $O(n^3)$ running time. To speed up the computation, we also present an algorithm to compute $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}-\\epsilon\\right)$-approximate resistance distance $\\mathcal{R}_v$ after iteratively adding $k$ edges, the running time of which is $\\widetilde{O} (mk\\epsilon^{-2})$ for any $\\epsilon>0$, where the $\\widetilde{O} (\\cdot)$ notation suppresses the ${\\rm poly} (\\log n)$ factors. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Liren Shan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shan:Liren", "Yuhao Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Yuhao", "Zhongzhi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongzhi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
