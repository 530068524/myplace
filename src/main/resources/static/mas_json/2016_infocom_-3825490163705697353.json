{"title": "Cupid: Congestion-free consistent data plane update in software defined networks.", "fields": ["dependency graph", "heuristic", "forwarding plane", "mesh networking", "software defined networking"], "abstract": "With the popular applications of SDN in load balancing and failure recovery, the controller schedules affected flows to redundant paths to avoid network congestions and failures by updating flow tables in data plane. However, inconsistent flow table updating may lead to transient incorrect network behaviors or undesired performance degradation. Therefore, the consistency imposes dependencies among updates, so that the order of updates must be carefully considered to keep the consistency. To update flow tables consistently and efficiently, in this paper, we propose an update ordering approach \u2014 Cupid. To avoid high overhead in update ordering, we divide the global dependencies among updates into local restrictions by: 1) partitioning a new routing path into several independent segments, 2) identifying critical nodes controlling traffic shifting between the old path and new path, and 3) constructing a dependency graph among critical nodes for potential congested links. We then design a heuristic algorithm to resolve the dependency graph. To save the flow table space, a switch keeps only one flow entry with multiple ports for a flow during updating. Our simulation shows that Cupid schedules updates at least 2 times faster and has less throughput losses than the state-of-the-art approaches in both fat-tree and mesh networks.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "National University of Defense Technology", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Wen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wen", "Wenbo He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Wenbo", "Jinshu Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Jinshu", "Yixin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yixin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
