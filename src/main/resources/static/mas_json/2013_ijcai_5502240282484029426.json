We focus on extracting valuable information from large amounts of news images and their captions, where multi-level image-caption pairs are constructed for characterizing both significant names with higher salience and their cohesion with human faces extracted from news images. To remedy the issue of lacking enough related information for rare name, Web mining is introduced to acquire the extra multimodal information. We also emphasize on an optimization mechanism by our Improved Self-Adaptive Simulated Annealing Genetic Algorithm to verify the feasibility of alignment combinations. Our experiments have obtained very positive results.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yuejie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yuejie", "Wei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wei", "Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang", "Cheng Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Cheng", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang", "Jianping Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan_0001:Jianping"], "pages": 8}
