Let  p  be an arbitrary distribution over an interval  I , and suppose that  p  is  \u03c4 -close (in total variation distance) to an unknown probability distribution  q  that is defined by an unknown partition of  I  into  t  intervals and  t  unknown degree  d  polynomials specifying  q  over each of the intervals. We give an algorithm that draws O( t ( d  + 1)/ e  2 ) samples from  p , runs in time poly( t, d  + 1, 1/ e ), and with high probability outputs a piecewise polynomial hypothesis distribution  h  that is (14 \u03c4 + e )-close to  p  in total variation distance. Our algorithm combines tools from real approximation theory, uniform convergence, linear programming, and dynamic programming. Its sample complexity is simultaneously near optimal in all three parameters  t, d  and  e ; we show that even for  \u03c4  = 0, any algorithm that learns an unknown  t -piecewise degree- d  probability distribution over  I  to accuracy  e  must use [EQUATION] samples from the distribution, regardless of its running time.   We apply this general algorithm to obtain a wide range of results for many natural density estimation problems over both continuous and discrete domains. These include state-of-the-art results for learning mixtures of log-concave distributions; mixtures of  t -modal distributions; mixtures of Monotone Hazard Rate distributions; mixtures of Poisson Binomial Distributions; mixtures of Gaussians; and mixtures of  k -monotone densities. Our general technique gives improved results, with provably optimal sample complexities (up to logarithmic factors) in all parameters in most cases, for all these problems via a single unified algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Edinburgh", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Siu-on Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Siu=on", "Ilias Diakonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakonikolas:Ilias", "Rocco A.
