We based our approach on Schon's notion of practitioners evolving shared 'appreciation systems' for discussing and critiquing work, and aimed to gather and share some of game designers' 'appreciation system' for games and learning. The resulting insights provide valuable pointers to other designers in the CHI community crafting game-like experiences.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "departments": ["New York University", "Dartmouth College", "New York University"], "authors": ["Katherine Isbister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isbister:Katherine", "Mary Flanagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flanagan:Mary", "Chelsea Hash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hash:Chelsea"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
