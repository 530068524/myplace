{"title": "Polynomial Invariants for Affine Programs.", "fields": ["algebraic number", "square matrix", "semigroup", "finite set", "expression"], "abstract": "We exhibit an algorithm to compute the strongest polynomial (or algebraic) invariants that hold at each location of a given affine program (i.e., a program having only non-deterministic (as opposed to conditional) branching and all of whose assignments are given by affine expressions). Our main tool is an algebraic result of independent interest: given a finite set of rational square matrices of the same dimension, we show how to compute the Zariski closure of the semigroup that they generate.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Ehud Hrushovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hrushovski:Ehud", "Jo\u00ebl Ouaknine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouaknine:Jo=euml=l", "Amaury Pouly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pouly:Amaury", "James Worrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Worrell_0001:James"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
