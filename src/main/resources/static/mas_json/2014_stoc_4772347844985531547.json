In this paper we consider approximate distance oracles for general undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights with constant query time. We present a distance oracle of size  O ( kn  1+1 /k  ), with 2 k  --- 1 stretch and  O (1) query time. This improves the  O (log  k ) query time of Wulff-Nilsen's distance oracle [SODA '13], which in turn improved the  O ( k ) query time of Thorup and Zwick's distance oracle [J. ACM '05].", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shiri Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Shiri"], "pages": 10}
