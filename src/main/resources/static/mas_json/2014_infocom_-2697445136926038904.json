To address these challenges, we for the first time properly define trust propagation and combination in arbitrary OSN topologies by proposing 3VSL (Three-Valued Subjective Logic). The 3VSL distinguishes the posteriori and priori uncer- tainties existing in trust, and the difference between distorting and original opinions, thus be able to compute multi-hop trusts in arbitrary graphs. We theoretically proved the capability based on the Dirichlet distribution. Furthermore, an online survey system is implemented to collect interpersonal trust data and validate the correctness and accuracy of 3VSL in real world. Both experimental and numerical results show that 3VSL is accurate in computing interpersonal trust in OSNs.
