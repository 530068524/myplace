{"title": "Efficient Structured Prediction with Latent Variables for General Graphical Models.", "fields": ["probabilistic latent semantic analysis", "latent variable", "latent class model", "structured prediction", "conditional random field"], "abstract": "In this paper we propose a unified framework for structured prediction with latent variables which includes hidden conditional random fields and latent structured support vector machines as special cases. We describe a local entropy approximation for this general formulation using duality, and derive an efficient message passing algorithm that is guaranteed to converge. We demonstrate its effectiveness in the tasks of image segmentation as well as 3D indoor scene understanding from single images, showing that our approach is superior to latent structured support vector machines and hidden conditional random fields.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "ETH Zurich", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "authors": ["Alexander G.
