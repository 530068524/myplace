{"title": "Predicting searcher frustration.", "fields": ["information seeking", "user modeling", "feature extraction", "frustration", "search engine"], "abstract": "When search engine users have trouble finding information, they may become frustrated, possibly resulting in a bad experience (even if they are ultimately successful). In a user study in which participants were given difficult information seeking tasks, half of all queries submitted resulted in some degree of self-reported frustration. A third of all successful tasks involved at least one instance of frustration. By modeling searcher frustration, search engines can predict the current state of user frustration and decide when to intervene with alternative search strategies to prevent the user from becoming more frustrated, giving up, or switching to another search engine. We present several models to predict frustration using features extracted from query logs and physical sensors. We are able to predict frustration with a mean average precision of 65% from the physical sensors, and 87% from the query log features.", "citation": "Citations (149)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Henry Allen Feild.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feild:Henry_Allen", "James Allan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allan:James", "Rosie Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones:Rosie"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
