{"title": "Dynamic Infinite Relational Model for Time-varying Relational Data Analysis.", "fields": ["relational model", "semi structured model", "logical data model", "data set", "statistical relational learning"], "abstract": "We propose a new probabilistic model for analyzing dynamic evolutions of relational data, such as additions, deletions and split & merge, of relation clusters like communities in social networks. Our proposed model abstracts observed time-varying object-object relationships into relationships between object clusters. We extend the infinite Hidden Markov model to follow dynamic and time-sensitive changes in the structure of the relational data and to estimate a number of clusters simultaneously. We show the usefulness of the model through experiments with synthetic and real-world data sets.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Katsuhiko Ishiguro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishiguro:Katsuhiko", "Tomoharu Iwata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwata:Tomoharu", "Naonori Ueda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ueda:Naonori", "Joshua B.
