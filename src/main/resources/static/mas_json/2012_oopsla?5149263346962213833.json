The underlying proof system is language-independent and consists of eight proof rules. The proof system is proved partially correct and relatively complete (with respect to the programming language configuration model). To show its practicality, the generic framework is instantiated with a fragment of C and evaluated with encouraging results.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Grigore Rosu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosu:Grigore", "Andrei Stefanescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefanescu:Andrei"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2012", "pages": 20}
