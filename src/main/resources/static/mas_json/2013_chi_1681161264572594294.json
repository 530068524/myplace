To address this problem we present  PixelTone , a multimodal photo editing interface that combines speech and direct manipulation. We observe existing image editing practices and derive a set of principles that guide our design. In particular, we use natural language for expressing desired changes to an image, and sketching to localize these changes to specific regions. To support the language commonly used in photo-editing we develop a customized natural language interpreter that maps user phrases to specific image processing operations. Finally, we perform a user study that evaluates and demonstrates the effectiveness of our interface.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems"], "authors": ["Gierad Laput.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laput:Gierad", "Mira Dontcheva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dontcheva:Mira", "Gregg Wilensky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilensky:Gregg", "Walter Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Walter", "Aseem Agarwala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwala:Aseem", "Jason Linder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linder:Jason", "Eytan Adar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adar:Eytan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
