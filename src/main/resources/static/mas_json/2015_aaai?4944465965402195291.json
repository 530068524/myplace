{"title": "Joint Anaphoricity Detection and Coreference Resolution with Constrained Latent Structures.", "fields": ["pairwise comparison", "perceptron", "pattern recognition", "coreference", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a new structured model for learning anaphoricity detection and coreference resolution in a joint fashion. Specifically, we use a latent tree to represent the full coreference and anaphoric structure of a document at a global level, and we jointly learn the parameters of the two models using a version of the structured perceptron algorithm. Our joint structured model is further refined by the use of pairwise constraints which help the model to capture accurately certain patterns of coreference. Our experiments on the CoNLL-2012 English datasets show large improvements in both coreference resolution and anaphoricity detection, compared to various competing architectures. Our best corefer-ence system obtains a CoNLL score of 81.97 on gold mentions, which is to date the best score reported on this setting.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Sorbonne", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Emmanuel Lassalle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lassalle:Emmanuel", "Pascal Denis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denis:Pascal"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
