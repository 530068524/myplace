{"title": "Symmetry Breaking via LexLeader Feasibility Checkers.", "fields": ["symmetry breaking", "combinatorics", "homogeneous space", "matrix", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "This paper considers matrix models, a class of CSPs which generally exhibit significant symmetries. It proposed the idea of LexLeader feasibility checkers that verify, during search, whether the current partial assignment can be extended into a canonical solution. The feasibility checkers are based on a novel result by [Katsirelos et al., 2010] on how to check efficiently whether a solution is canonical. The paper generalizes this result to partial assignments, various variable orderings, and value symmetries. Empirical results on 5 standard benchmarks shows that feasibility checkers may bring significant performance gains, when jointly used with DOUBLELEX or SNAKELEX.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Justin Yip.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yip:Justin", "Pascal Van Hentenryck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hentenryck:Pascal_Van"], "pages": 6}
