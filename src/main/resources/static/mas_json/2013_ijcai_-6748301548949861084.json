In particular, it considers the problem of reasoning with properties that may not always be defined. Furthermore, we may even be uncertain about whether a property is defined for a given individual. One approach is to explicitly add a value \"undefined\" to the range of random variables, forming extended belief networks; however, adding an extra value to a random variable's range has a large computational overhead. In this paper, we propose an alternative, ontologically-based belief networks, where all properties are only used when they are defined, and we show how probabilistic reasoning can be carried out without explicitly using the value \"undefined\" during inference. We prove this is equivalent to reasoning with the corresponding extended belief network and empirically demonstrate that inference becomes more efficient.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Chia-Li Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Chia=Li", "David Buchman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buchman:David", "Arzoo Katiyar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katiyar:Arzoo", "David Poole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poole_0001:David"], "pages": 8}
