By defining lower bounds based on the proposed approximation, cluster algorithms can be considerably accelerated without loss of quality. In extensive experiments, we show a considerable reduction in terms of computational time in comparison to standard methods and the recently proposed Yinyang k-means. Additionally we show that the memory consumption of the presented clustering algorithm does not depend on the number of clusters, which makes the approach suitable for large scale problems.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "Avira Operation ... tnang, Germany"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Thomas Bottesch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bottesch:Thomas", "Thomas B\u00fchler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=uuml=hler:Thomas", "Markus K\u00e4chele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=auml=chele:Markus"], "pages": 9}
