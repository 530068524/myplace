{"title": "Preprocessing for Propositional Model Counting.", "fields": ["xor gate", "propositional calculus", "equivalence", "vivification", "preprocessor"], "abstract": "This paper is concerned with preprocessing techniques for propositional model counting. We have implemented a preprocessor which includes many elementary preprocessing techniques, including occurrence reduction, vivification, backbone identification, as well as equivalence, AND and XOR gate identification and replacement. We performed intensive experiments, using a huge number of benchmarks coming from a large number of families. Two approaches to model counting have been considered downstream: \"direct\" model counting using Cachet and compilation-based model counting, based on the C2D compiler. The experimental results we have obtained show that our preprocessor is both efficient and robust.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Jean-Marie Lagniez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lagniez:Jean=Marie", "Pierre Marquis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marquis:Pierre"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
