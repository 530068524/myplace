Binary codes are well suited to large-scale applications as they are storage efficient and permit exact sub-linear kNN search. The framework is applicable to broad families of mappings, and uses a flexible form of triplet ranking loss. We overcome discontinuous optimization of the discrete mappings by minimizing a piecewise-smooth upper bound on empirical loss, inspired by latent structural SVMs. We develop a new loss-augmented inference algorithm that is quadratic in the code length. We show strong retrieval performance on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, with promising classification results using no more than kNN on the binary codes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Dankook University"], "authors": ["Mohammad Norouzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norouzi_0002:Mohammad", "David J.
