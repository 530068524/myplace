{"title": "Scalable Semi-Supervised Aggregation of Classifiers.", "fields": ["ensemble learning", "random subspace method", "random forest", "scalability", "binary number"], "abstract": "We present and empirically evaluate an efficient algorithm that learns to aggregate the predictions of an ensemble of binary classifiers. The algorithm uses the structure of the ensemble predictions on unlabeled data to yield significant performance improvements. It does this without making assumptions on the structure or origin of the ensemble, without parameters, and as scalably as linear learning. We empirically demonstrate these performance gains with random forests.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Akshay Balsubramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balsubramani:Akshay", "Yoav Freund.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freund:Yoav"], "pages": 9}
