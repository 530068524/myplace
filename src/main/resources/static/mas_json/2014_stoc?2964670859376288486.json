{"title": "Minimum bisection is fixed parameter tractable.", "fields": ["bounded function", "minimum weight", "tree decomposition", "bisection", "bisection method"], "abstract": "In the classic Minimum Bisection problem we are given as input a graph  G  and an integer  k . The task is to determine whether there is a partition of  V  ( G ) into two parts  A  and  B  such that || A | -- | B || \u2264 1 and there are at most  k  edges with one endpoint in  A  and the other in  B . In this paper we give an algorithm for Minimum Bisection with running time  O (2 O(k 3 )  n 3  log 3   n ). This is the first fixed parameter tractable algorithm for Minimum Bisection. At the core of our algorithm lies a new decomposition theorem that states that every graph  G  can be decomposed by small separators into parts where each part is \"highly connected\" in the following sense: any cut of bounded size can separate only a limited number of vertices from each part of the decomposition.   Our techniques generalize to the weighted setting, where we seek for a bisection of minimum weight among solutions that contain at most  k  edges.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Bergen", "University of Bergen", "University of Bergen", "University of Bergen"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Marek Cygan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cygan:Marek", "Daniel Lokshtanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lokshtanov:Daniel", "Marcin Pilipczuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilipczuk:Marcin", "Michal Pilipczuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilipczuk:Michal", "Saket Saurabh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saurabh_0001:Saket"], "pages": 10}
