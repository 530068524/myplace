{"title": "How Design-inclusive UXR Influenced the Integration of Project Activities: Three Design Cases from Industry.", "fields": ["design education", "merge", "experience design", "psychological intervention", "user experience design"], "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss how the implementation of design-inclusive User Experience Research (UXR) has influenced the composition of UXR and design activities in the industrial setting of Philips Design. We present three design case studies that were executed in a time span of three years: a baby sleep project; a pregnancy project; and a baby bottle-feeding project. Through a retrospective analysis we conclude that the approach adopted in these cases progressed from complete separation of UXR and design activities to design-inclusive UXR in which design forms an integral part of research. This is reflected by a rearrangement of project activities to  identify, envision, enable  and  evaluate  user experiences. Previously the UXR ( identify  and  evaluate ) and design ( envision  and  enable ) activities were executed sequentially. Now, these four project activities merge in studying design interventions in context over a prolonged time, to iteratively explore and advance UX design qualities.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Philips Design", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Janne van Kollenburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kollenburg:Janne_van", "Sander Bogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogers:Sander", "Eva Deckers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deckers:Eva", "Joep W.
