It has had many applications from study of optimal reduction to proofs of complexity bounds. Yet, context semantics have been defined only on \u03bb-calculus and linear logic.   In order to study other languages, in particular languages with more primitives (built-in arithmetic, pattern matching,...) we define a context semantics for a broader framework: interaction nets. These are a well-behaved class of graph rewriting systems.   Here, two applications are explored. First, we define a notion of weight, based on context semantics paths, which bounds the length of reduction of nets. Then, we define a denotational semantics for a large class of interaction net systems.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Lyon"], "authors": ["Matthieu Perrinel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perrinel:Matthieu"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
