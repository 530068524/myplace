Existing network embedding works primarily focus on preserving the microscopic structure, such as the first- and second-order proximity of vertexes, while the macroscopic scale-free property is largely ignored. Scale-free property depicts the fact that vertex degrees follow a heavy-tailed distribution (i.e., only a few vertexes have high degrees) and is a critical property of real-world networks, such as social networks. In this paper, we study the problem of learning representations for scale-free networks. We first theoretically analyze the difficulty of embedding and reconstructing a scale-free network in the Euclidean space, by converting our problem to the sphere packing problem. Then, we propose the \"degree penalty\" principle for designing scale-free property preserving network embedding algorithm: punishing the proximity between high-degree vertexes. We introduce two implementations of our principle by utilizing the spectral techniques and a skip-gram model respectively. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that our algorithms are able to not only reconstruct heavy-tailed distributed degree distribution, but also outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various network mining tasks, such as vertex classification and link prediction.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Rui Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Rui", "Yang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0009:Yang", "Wenjie Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Wenjie", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Yueting Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yueting"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
