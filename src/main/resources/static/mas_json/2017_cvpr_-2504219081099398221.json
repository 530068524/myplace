We introduce Single-Stream Temporal Action Proposals (SST), a new effective and efficient deep architecture for the generation of temporal action proposals. Our network can run continuously in a single stream over very long input video sequences, without the need to divide input into short overlapping clips or temporal windows for batch processing. We demonstrate empirically that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the task of temporal action proposal generation, while achieving some of the fastest processing speeds in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that using SST proposals in conjunction with existing action classifiers results in improved state-of-the-art temporal action detection performance.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "Universidad del Norte, Colombia"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shyamal Buch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buch:Shyamal", "Victor Escorcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Escorcia:Victor", "Chuanqi Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chuanqi", "Bernard Ghanem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghanem:Bernard", "Juan Carlos Niebles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niebles:Juan_Carlos"], "pages": 10}
