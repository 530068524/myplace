Detecting fatigue is the first step in rectifying this problem. Fatigue in usability analysis is usually detected through conducting questionnaires and observations. This paper introduces an objective indirect discovery of user's fatigue through analyzing data of a haptic writing application. Our results show that if users are feeling tired their kinetic energy would decrease. We can compute this kinetic energy from the velocity of the arm movement during the usage of the haptic device.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa"], "authors": ["Abdelwahab Hamam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamam:Abdelwahab", "Nicolas D.
