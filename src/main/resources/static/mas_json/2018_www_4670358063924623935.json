Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm boasts the best asymptotic upper bound on the running time for the case when the input graph is sparse. Our experimental evaluation on large real-world graphs demonstrates that our parallel algorithm is faster than state-of-the-art algorithms, while boasting an excellent degree of parallelism. In particular, we are able to list all k-cliques (for any value of k) in graphs containing up to tens of millions of edges as well as all 10-cliques in graphs containing billions of edges, within a few minutes and a few hours respectively. We show how it can be employed as an effective subroutine for finding the k-clique core decomposition and an approximate k-clique densest subgraphs in very large real-world graphs.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "Max Planck Society", "Google"], "authors": ["Maximilien Danisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danisch:Maximilien", "Oana Denisa Balalau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balalau:Oana_Denisa", "Mauro Sozio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sozio:Mauro"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
