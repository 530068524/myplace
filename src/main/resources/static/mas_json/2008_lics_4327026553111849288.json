We show that if A generates a so-called arithmetical variety then CSP(B), the constraint satisfaction problem associated to B, is solvable in Logspace; in fact notCSP(B) is expressible in symmetric Datalog. In particular, we obtain that notCSP(B) is expressible in Datalog and the relations of B are invariant under a Maltsev operation then notCSP(B) is in symmetric Datalog.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Concordia University", "Univ.
