The current approach is difficult to scale, requiring constraint solving and solution enumeration. We observe that the assumption relation among design decisions for most software systems can be abstractly modeled using a special form of ACN. For these more restrictive, but highly representative models, we present an O(n^3) algorithm to derive the dependency relation without solving the constraints. We evaluate our approach by computing design structure matrices for existing ACNs that model multiple versions of heterogenous real software designs, often reducing the running time from hours to seconds.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "authors": ["Sunny Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Sunny", "Yuanfang Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Yuanfang"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
