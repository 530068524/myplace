This improves on the previous fastest algorithm: the deterministic ~O(4 n )-time and ~O(2 n )-space algorithm of Micciancio and Voulgaris (STOC 2010, SIAM J. Comp. 2013). In fact, we give a conceptually simple algorithm that solves the (in our opinion, even more interesting) problem of discrete Gaussian sampling (DGS). More specifically, we show how to sample 2 n/2  vectors from the discrete Gaussian distribution at  any parameter  in 2 n+o(n)  time and space. (Prior work only solved DGS for very large parameters.) Our SVP result then follows from a natural reduction from SVP to DGS.   In addition, we give a more refined algorithm for DGS above the so-called  smoothing parameter  of the lattice, which can generate 2 n/2  discrete Gaussian samples in just 2 n/2+o(n)  time and space. Among other things, this implies a 2 n/2+o(n) -time and space algorithm for 1.93-approximate decision SVP.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "New York University", "New York University", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "Bhabha Atomic Research Centre"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Divesh Aggarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aggarwal:Divesh", "Daniel Dadush.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dadush:Daniel", "Oded Regev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regev_0001:Oded", "Noah Stephens-Davidowitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stephens=Davidowitz:Noah"], "pages": 10}
