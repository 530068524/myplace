First, we analyze these data sets to understand mobility patterns, home and work locations, and social ties between users. Then, we develop an efficient algorithm for matching users with similar mobility patterns, considering a range of constraints, including social distance. The solution provides an upper bound to the potential decrease in the number of cars in a city that can be achieved by ride-sharing. Our results indicate that this decrease can be as high as 31%, when users are willing to ride with friends of friends.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Telef\u00f3nica"], "authors": ["Blerim Cici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cici:Blerim", "Athina Markopoulou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markopoulou:Athina", "Enrique Fr\u00edas-Mart\u00ednez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fr=iacute=as=Mart=iacute=nez:Enrique", "Nikolaos Laoutaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laoutaris:Nikolaos"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
