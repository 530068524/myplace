{"title": "Reasoning With Neural Tensor Networks for Knowledge Base Completion.", "fields": ["sumatran tiger", "question answering", "tensor", "wordnet", "knowledge base"], "abstract": "Knowledge bases are an important resource for question answering and other tasks but often suffer from incompleteness and lack of ability to reason over their discrete entities and relationships. In this paper we introduce an expressive neural tensor network suitable for reasoning over relationships between two entities. Previous work represented entities as either discrete atomic units or with a single entity vector representation. We show that performance can be improved when entities are represented as an average of their constituting word vectors. This allows sharing of statistical strength between, for instance, facts involving the \"Sumatran tiger\" and \"Bengal tiger.\" Lastly, we demonstrate that all models improve when these word vectors are initialized with vectors learned from unsupervised large corpora. We assess the model by considering the problem of predicting additional true relations between entities given a subset of the knowledge base. Our model outperforms previous models and can classify unseen relationships in WordNet and FreeBase with an accuracy of 86.2% and 90.0%, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (670)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Richard Socher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Socher:Richard", "Danqi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Danqi", "Christopher D.
