In addition to reducing operation costs, precisely controlling power consumption is an essential way to avoid system failures caused by power capacity overload or overheating due to increasing high-density. Control-theoretic techniques have recently shown a lot of promise on power management thanks to their better control performance and theoretical guarantees on control accuracy and system stability. However, existing work over-simplifies the problem by controlling a single server independently from others. As a result, at the cluster level where multiple servers are correlated by common workloads and share common power supplies, power cannot be shared to improve application performance. In this paper, we propose a cluster-level power controller that shifts power among servers based on their performance needs, while controlling the total power of the cluster to be lower than a constraint. Our controller features a rigorous design based on an optimal multi-input-multi-output control theory. Empirical results demonstrate that our controller outperforms two state-of-the-art controllers, by having better application performance and more accurate power control.", "citation": "Citations (236)", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee"], "authors": ["Xiaorui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaorui", "Ming Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0002:Ming"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
