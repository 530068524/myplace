{"title": "CAFO: Cost aware flip optimization for asymmetric memories.", "fields": ["bit error rate", "nand gate", "random access", "flip", "phase change memory"], "abstract": "Phase Change Memory (PCM) and spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) are emerging as new memory technologies to replace DRAM and NAND flash that are impeded by physical limitations. Programming PCM cells degrades their endurance while programming STT-RAM cells incurs a high bit error rate. Accordingly, several schemes have been proposed to service write requests while programing as few memory cells as possible. Nevertheless, those schemes did not address the asymmetry in programming memory cells that characterizes both PCM and STT-RAM. For instance, writing a bit value of 0 on PCM cells is more detrimental to endurance than 1 while writing a bit value of 1 on STT-RAM cells is more prone to error than 0. In this paper, we propose CAFO as a new cost aware flip reduction scheme. Essentially, CAFO encompasses a cost model that computes the cost of servicing write requests through assigning different costs to each cell that requires programming. Subsequently, CAFO encodes the data to be written into a form that incurs less cost through its cost aware encoding module. Overall, CAFO is capable of cutting down the write cost by up to 65% more than existing schemes.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Rakan Maddah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maddah:Rakan", "Seyed Mohammad Seyedzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seyedzadeh:Seyed_Mohammad", "Rami G.
