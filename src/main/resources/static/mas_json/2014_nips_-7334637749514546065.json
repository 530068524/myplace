We suppose that the market interest rate, the drift and the volatility of the underlying risky asset switch over time according to the state of an economy, which is modelled by a continuous-time Markov chain. The measure process is defined to be a generalized mixture of Poisson random measure and encompasses a general class of processes, for example, a generalized gamma process, which includes the weighted gamma process and the inverse Gaussian process. Another interesting feature of the measure process is that jump times and jump sizes can be correlated in general. The model considered here can provide market practitioners with flexibility in modelling the dynamics of the underlying risky asset. We employ the generalized regime-switching Esscher transform to determine an equivalent martingale measure in the incomplete market setting.
