Recent energy-related hardware developments trend towards offering more and more configuration opportunities for the software to control its own energy consumption. Existing research so far mainly focused on leveraging this configuration spectrum to find the most energy-efficient configuration for specific operators or entire queries. In this demo, we introduce the concept of energy elasticity and propose the energy-control loop as an implementation of this concept. Energy elasticity refers to the ability of software to behave energy-proportional and energy-efficient at the same time while maintaining a certain quality of service. Thus, our system does not draw the least energy possible but the least energy necessary to still perform reasonably. We demonstrate our overall approach using a rich interactive GUI to give attendees the opportunity to learn more about our concept.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Annett Ungeth\u00fcm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ungeth=uuml=m:Annett", "Thomas Kissinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kissinger:Thomas", "Willi-Wolfram Mentzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mentzel:Willi=Wolfram", "Dirk Habich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habich:Dirk", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "pages": 4}
