To address this challenge, we propose novel transmission scheduling techniques that handle the routing uncertainty introduced by mobility. The core of the scheduling techniques involves controlling the order in which transmissions are scheduled and intelligently scheduling multiple transmissions in a single entry of the scheduling matrix without conflict. Flow-Ordered Mobility-Aware Real-time Scheduling (FO-MARS) integrates these techniques to provide a 14x increase in real-time capacity compared to the baseline algorithms designed for static real-time networks. Additionally, we propose Additive Mobility-Aware Real-time Scheduling (A-MARS), which can handle network dynamics such as the addition or removal of flows without having to reschedule previously admitted flows. As a result, A-MARS achieves significantly lower admission latency than that of the baselines.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Iowa", "University of Iowa", "University of Iowa"], "authors": ["Behnam Dezfouli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dezfouli:Behnam", "Marjan Radi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radi:Marjan", "Octav Chipara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chipara:Octav"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
