The current approach involves two training phases: a fully unsupervised learning followed by a strongly discriminative optimization. We suggest a deep learning strategy that bridges the gap between the two phases, resulting in a three-phase learning procedure. We propose to implement the scheme using a method to regularize deep belief networks with top-down information. The network is constructed from building blocks of restricted Boltzmann machines learned by combining bottom-up and top-down sampled signals. A global optimization procedure that merges samples from a forward bottom-up pass and a top-down pass is used. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show improvements over the existing algorithms for deep belief networks. Object recognition results on the Caltech-101 dataset also yield competitive results.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "University of Paris", "University of Paris", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research"], "authors": ["Hanlin Goh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goh:Hanlin", "Nicolas Thome.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thome:Nicolas", "Matthieu Cord.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cord:Matthieu", "Joo-Hwee Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Joo=Hwee"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
