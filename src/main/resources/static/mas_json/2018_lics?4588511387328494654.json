{"title": "Logics for Word Transductions with Synthesis.", "fields": ["equivalence", "binary relation", "expressivity", "expressive power", "decidability"], "abstract": "We introduce a logic, called lT, to express properties of transductions, i.e. binary relations from input to output (finite) words. In lT, the input/output dependencies are modelled via an origin function which associates to any position of the output word, the input position from which it originates. lT is well-suited to express relations (which are not necessarily functional), and can express all regular functional transductions, i.e. transductions definable for instance by deterministic two-way transducers.   Despite its high expressive power, lT has decidable satisfiability and equivalence problems, with tight non-elementary and elementary complexities, depending on specific representation of lT-formulas. Our main contribution is a synthesis result: from any transduction R defined in lT, it is possible to synthesise a regular functional transduction f such that for all input words u in the domain of R, f is defined and (u, f(u)) \u2208 R. As a consequence, we obtain that any functional transduction is regular iff it is lT-definable.   We also investigate the algorithmic and expressiveness properties of several extensions of lT, and explicit a correspondence between transductions and data words. As a side-result, we obtain a new decidable logic for data words.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles"], "authors": ["Luc Dartois.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dartois:Luc", "Emmanuel Filiot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filiot:Emmanuel", "Nathan Lhote.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lhote:Nathan"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
