The main contribution of this paper is the extension to the distributed-memory environment of the previous work done by Hadri et al. on Communication- Avoiding QR (CA-QR) factorizations for tall and skinny matrices (initially done on shared-memory multicore systems). The fine granularity of tile algorithms associated with communicationavoiding techniques for the QR factorization presents a high degree of parallelism where multiple tasks can be concurrently executed, computation and communication largely overlapped, and computation steps fully pipelined. A decentralized dynamic scheduler has then been integrated as a runtime system to efficiently schedule tasks across the distributed resources. Our experimental results performed on two clusters (with dual-core and 8-core nodes, respectively) and a Cray XT5 system with 12-core nodes show that the tile CA-QR factorization is able to outperform the de facto ScaLAPACK library by up to 4 times for tall and skinny matrices, and has good scalability on up to 3,072 cores.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "University of Tennessee"], "authors": ["Fengguang Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Fengguang", "Hatem Ltaief.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ltaief:Hatem", "Bilel Hadri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hadri:Bilel", "Jack J.
