The proposed system can present smell synchronously with the movie displayed on the screen. The olfactory display is composed of electroosmotic (EO) pumps and a surface acoustic wave (SAW) device to store liquid odorants and atomize them forcibly into smells. It is suitable for scents generation with movie because of the capability to generate smells rapidly even the scents of low-volatile substances which typically require long time to be released. A user can enjoy the video with scents by using this system without smell persistence. Lastly, a sensory test was conducted to evaluate the proposed system.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yossiri Ariyakul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ariyakul:Yossiri", "Tomoyuki Aizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aizawa:Tomoyuki", "Takamichi Nakamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakamoto:Takamichi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
