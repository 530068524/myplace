{"title": "Characterizing Online Rumoring Behavior Using Multi-Dimensional Signatures.", "fields": ["lexical diversity", "geolocation", "social computing", "misinformation", "rumor"], "abstract": "This study offers an in-depth analysis of four rumors that spread through Twitter after the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings. Through qualitative and visual analysis, we describe each rumor's origins, changes over time, and relationships between different types of rumoring behavior. We identify several quantitative measures-including temporal progression, domain diversity, lexical diversity and geolocation features-that constitute a multi-dimensional signature for each rumor, and provide evidence supporting the existence of different rumor types. Ultimately these signatures enhance our understanding of how different kinds of rumors propagate online during crisis events. In constructing these signatures, this research demonstrates and documents an emerging method for deeply and recursively integrating qualitative and quantitative methods for analysis of social media trace data.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Jim Maddock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maddock:Jim", "Kate Starbird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starbird:Kate", "Haneen J.
