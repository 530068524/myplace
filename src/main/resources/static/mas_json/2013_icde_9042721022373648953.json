In this paper, we introduce the concept of graph icebergs that refer to vertices for which the concentration (aggregation) of an attribute in their vicinities is abnormally high. Intuitively, these vertices shall be \u201cclose\u201d to the attribute of interest in the graph space. Based on this intuition, we propose a novel framework, called gIceberg, which performs aggregation using random walks, rather than traditional SUM and AVG aggregate functions. This proposed framework scores vertices by their different levels of interestingness and finds important vertices that meet a user-specified threshold. To improve scalability, two aggregation strategies, forward and backward aggregation, are proposed with corresponding optimization techniques and bounds. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic large graphs demonstrate that gIceberg is effective and scalable.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "Zhejiang University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Nan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Nan", "Ziyu Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Ziyu", "Lijie Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Lijie", "Jian Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jian", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "Xifeng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Xifeng"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
