{"title": "Using Linearly-Homomorphic Encryption to Evaluate Degree-2 Functions on Encrypted Data.", "fields": ["elgamal encryption", "on the fly encryption", "multiple encryption", "filesystem level encryption", "40 bit encryption"], "abstract": "We show a technique to transform a linearly-homomorphic encryption into a scheme capable of evaluating degree-2 computations on ciphertexts. Our transformation is surprisingly simple and requires only one very mild property on the underlying linearly-homomorphic scheme: the message space must be a public ring in which it is possible to sample elements uniformly at random. This allows us to instantiate our transformation with virtually all existing number-theoretic linearly-homomorphic schemes, such as Goldwasser-Micali, Paillier, or ElGamal. Our resulting schemes achieve circuit privacy and are compact when considering a subclass of degree-2 polynomials where the number of additions of degree-2 terms is bounded by a constant.   As an additional contribution we extend our technique to build a protocol for outsourcing computation on encrypted data using two (non-communicating) servers. Somewhat interestingly, in this case we can boost a linearly-homomorphic scheme to support the evaluation of any degree-2 polynomial while achieving full compactness.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Catania", "IMDEA"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Dario Catalano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catalano:Dario", "Dario Fiore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiore:Dario"], "pages": 12}
