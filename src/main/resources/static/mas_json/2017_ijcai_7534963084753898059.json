Our solution, coined reinforcement mechanism design, is rooted in game theory but incorporates recent AI techniques to get rid of nonrealistic modeling assumptions and to make automated optimization feasible. We instantiate our framework on the key application scenarios of Baidu and Taobao, two of the largest mobile app companies in China. For the Taobao case, our framework automatically designs mechanisms that allocate buyer impressions for the e-commerce website; for the Baidu case, our framework automatically designs dynamic reserve pricing schemes of advertisement auctions of the search engine. Experiments show that our solutions outperform the state-of-the-art alternatives and those currently deployed, under both scenarios.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "University of Oxford", "Tsinghua University", "University of California, Berkeley", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Pingzhong Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Pingzhong"], "pages": 5}
