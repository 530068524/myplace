Participants in face-to-face interactions have many cues to each other's affect, but work is increasingly carried out via computer-mediated channels that lack many of these cues. Current presence systems enable users to estimate the availability of other users, but not their affective states or communication preferences. This work demonstrates the feasibility of estimating affective state and communication preferences from a stream of presence states that are already being shared in a deployed presence system.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory"], "authors": ["Anbang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Anbang", "Jacob T.
