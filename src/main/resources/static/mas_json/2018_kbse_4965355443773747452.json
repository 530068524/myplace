{"title": "ReScue: crafting regular expression DoS attacks.", "fields": ["regular expression", "denial of service attack", "string", "redos", "genetic algorithm"], "abstract": "Regular expression (regex) with modern extensions is one of the most popular string processing tools. However, poorly-designed regexes can yield exponentially many matching steps, and lead to regex Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) attacks under well-conceived string inputs. This paper presents Rescue, a three-phase gray-box analytical technique, to automatically generate ReDoS strings to highlight vulnerabilities of given regexes. Rescue systematically seeds (by a genetic search), incubates (by another genetic search), and finally pumps (by a regex-dedicated algorithm) for generating strings with maximized search time. We implemenmted the Rescue tool and evaluated it against 29,088 practical regexes in real-world projects. The evaluation results show that Rescue found 49% more attack strings compared with the best existing technique, and applying Rescue to popular GitHub projects discovered ten previously unknown ReDoS vulnerabilities.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Yuju Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yuju", "Yanyan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0001:Yanyan", "Chang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Chang", "Ping Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0002:Ping", "Xiaoxing Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaoxing", "Jian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0001:Jian"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
