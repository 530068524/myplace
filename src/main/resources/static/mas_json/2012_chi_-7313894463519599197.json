Models of legacy systems are used to compare products to competitors, or new proposed design ideas to the existing version of an application. We present CogTool-Helper, an exemplar of a tool that results from joining this HCI need to research in automatic GUI testing from the Software Engineering testing community. CogTool-Helper uses automatic UI-model extraction and test case generation to automatically create CogTool storyboards and models and infer methods to accomplish tasks beyond what the UI designer has specified. A design walkthrough with experienced CogTool users reveal that CogTool-Helper resonates with a \"pain point\" of real-world modeling and provide suggestions for future work.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Amanda Swearngin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swearngin:Amanda", "Myra B.
