{"title": "The Catch(es) with Smart Home: Experiences of a Living Lab Field Study.", "fields": ["living lab", "home automation", "user experience design", "dashboard", "use case"], "abstract": "Smart home systems are becoming an integral feature of the emerging home IT market. Under this general term, products mainly address issues of security, energy savings and comfort. Comprehensive systems that cover several use cases are typically operated and managed via a unified dashboard. Unfortunately, research targeting user experience (UX) design for smart home interaction that spans several use cases or covering the entire system is scarce. Furthermore, existing comprehensive and user-centered longterm studies on challenges and needs throughout phases of information collection, installation and operation of smart home systems are technologically outdated. Our 18-month Living Lab study covering 14 households equipped with smart home technology provides insights on how to design for improving smart home appropriation. This includes a stronger sensibility for household practices during setup and configuration, flexible visualizations for evolving demands and an extension of smart home beyond the location.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Timo Jakobi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jakobi:Timo", "Corinna Ogonowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogonowski:Corinna", "Nico Castelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castelli:Nico", "Gunnar Stevens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stevens:Gunnar", "Volker Wulf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulf:Volker"], "pages": 14}
