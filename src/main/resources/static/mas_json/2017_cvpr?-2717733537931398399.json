Our model combines the appearance and motion pathways of a two-stream architecture by motion gating and is trained end-to-end. We theoretically motivate multiplicative gating functions for residual networks and empirically study their effect on classification accuracy. To capture long-term dependencies we inject identity mapping kernels for learning temporal relationships. Our architecture is fully convolutional in spacetime and able to evaluate a video in a single forward pass. Empirical investigation reveals that our model produces state-of-the-art results on two standard action recognition datasets.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["VRVis", "York University", "Institute of El ... ocessing (4380)"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Christoph Feichtenhofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feichtenhofer:Christoph", "Axel Pinz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinz:Axel", "Richard P.
