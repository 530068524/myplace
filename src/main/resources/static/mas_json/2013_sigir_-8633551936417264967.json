{"title": "Exploring semi-automatic nugget extraction for Japanese one click access evaluation.", "fields": ["data mining", "computer science", "scalability", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Building test collections based on  nuggets  is useful evaluating systems that return documents, answers, or summaries. However, nugget construction requires a lot of manual work and is not feasible for large query sets. Towards an efficient and scalable nugget-based evaluation, we study the applicability of semi-automatic nugget extraction in the context of the ongoing NTCIR   One Click Access  (1CLICK) task. We compare manually-extracted and semi-automatically-extracted Japanese nuggets to demonstrate the coverage and efficiency of the semi-automatic nugget extraction. Our findings suggest that the manual nugget extraction can be replaced with a direct adaptation of the English semi-automatic nugget extraction system, especially for queries for which the user desires broad answers from free-form text.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Kyoto University", "Microsoft", "Kyoto University"], "authors": ["Matthew Ekstrand-Abueg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ekstrand=Abueg:Matthew", "Virgil Pavlu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pavlu:Virgil", "Makoto P.
