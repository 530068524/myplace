As a consequence of their succinct representation, many GCP-net related tasks are computationally hard. Even finding the more preferable of two outcomes is PSPACE-complete. In this work, we employ the framework of parameterized complexity to achieve two goals: First, we want to gain a deeper understanding of the complexity of GCP-nets. Second, we search for efficient fixed-parameter tractable algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Martin Kronegger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kronegger:Martin", "Martin Lackner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lackner:Martin", "Andreas Pfandler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfandler:Andreas", "Reinhard Pichler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pichler:Reinhard"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
