For this kind of problem, recommendation fairness and driving efficiency are two fundamental aspects. In the paper, we propose SCRAM, a sharing considered route assignment mechanism for fair taxi route recommendations. SCRAM aims to provide recommendation fairness for a group of competing taxi drivers, without sacrificing driving efficiency. By designing a concise route assignment mechanism, SCRAM achieves better recommendation fairness for competing taxis. By considering the sharing of road sections to avoid unnecessary competition, SCRAM is more efficient in terms of driving cost per customer (DCC). We test SCRAM based on a large number of historical taxi trajectories and validate the recommendation fairness and driving efficiency of SCRAM with extensive evaluations. Experimental results show that SCRAM achieves better recommendation fairness and higher driving efficiency than three compared approaches.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of Lyon", "University of Lyon", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Shiyou Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Shiyou", "Jian Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Jian", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Le Mou\u00ebl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mou=euml=l:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric_Le", "Issam Sahel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahel:Issam", "Minglu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Minglu"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
