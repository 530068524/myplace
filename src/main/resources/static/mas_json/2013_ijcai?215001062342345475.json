Data of different domains often have very different structures. These data can be modeled by different distributions and reconstruction functions. For example, real valued data can be modeled by the Gaussian distribution with a linear reconstruction function, whereas binary valued data may be more appropriately modeled by the Bernoulli distribution with a logit or probit function. Based on general linear models, we propose a unified framework for extracting features from data of different domains. A general optimization algorithm based on natural gradient ascent on distribution manifold is proposed for obtaining the maximum likelihood solutions. We also present some specific algorithms derived from this framework to deal with specific data modeling problems such as document modeling. Experimental results of these algorithms on several data sets are shown for the validation of GLPCA.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Mo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Mo", "Wei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0044:Wei", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang", "Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0010:Wei"], "pages": 6}
