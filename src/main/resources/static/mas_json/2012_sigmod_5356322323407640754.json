{"title": "Kaizen: a semi-automatic index advisor.", "fields": ["kaizen", "indexation", "database administrator", "workload", "automatic indexing"], "abstract": "Index tuning; i.e., selecting indexes that are appropriate for the workload to obtain good system performance, is a crucial task for database administrators. Administrators rely on automated index advisors for this task, but existing advisors work either offline, requiring a-priori knowledge of the workload, or online, taking the administrator out of the picture and assuming total control of the index tuning task. Semi-automatic index tuning is a new paradigm that achieves a middle ground: the advisor analyzes the workload online and provides recommendations tailored to the current workload, and the administrator is able to provide feedback to refine future recommendations. In this demonstration we present Kaizen, an index tuning tool that implements semi-automatic tuning.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ivo Jimenez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jimenez:Ivo", "Huascar Sanchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanchez:Huascar", "Quoc Trung Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran:Quoc_Trung", "Neoklis Polyzotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polyzotis:Neoklis"], "pages": 4}
