Unfortunately, realizing the full potential of ring-based cryptography has so far been hindered by a lack of practical algorithms and analytical tools for working in this context. As a result, most previous works have focused on very special classes of rings such as power-of-two cyclotomics, which significantly restricts the possible applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "New York University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Vadim Lyubashevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyubashevsky:Vadim", "Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris", "Oded Regev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regev_0001:Oded"], "pages": 20}
