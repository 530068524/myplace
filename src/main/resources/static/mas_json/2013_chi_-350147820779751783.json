We used ethnographic methods to investigate whether technology plays a role in supporting new mothers. Our research identified two core themes: (1) the need to improve confidence as a mother; and (2) the need to be more than \\'18just' a mother. We reflect on these findings both in terms of those interested in designing applications and services for motherhood and also the wider CHI community.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "departments": ["University of Dundee", "University of Dundee"], "authors": ["Lorna Gibson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gibson:Lorna", "Vicki L.
