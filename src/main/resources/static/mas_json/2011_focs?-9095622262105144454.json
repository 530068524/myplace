The garbled circuit construction is a central tool for constant-round secure computation and has several other applications. Motivated by these applications, we suggest an efficient arithmetic variant of Yao's original construction. Our construction transforms an arithmetic circuit $C : \\mathbb{Z}^n\\to\\mathbb{Z}^m$ over integers from a bounded (but possibly exponential) range into a garbled circuit $\\hat{C}$ along with $n$ affine functions $L_i : \\mathbb{Z}\\to \\mathbb{Z}^k$ such that $\\hat{C}$ together with the $n$ integer vectors $L_i(x_i)$ reveal $C(x)$ and no additional information about $x$. The security of our construction relies on the intractability of the learning with errors problem.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Benny Applebaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Applebaum:Benny", "Yuval Ishai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishai:Yuval", "Eyal Kushilevitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kushilevitz:Eyal"], "pages": 10}
