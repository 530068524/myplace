This paper analyzes the threat of topology-exposure and proposes a Topology-Hiding Multipath Routing protocol (THMR). THMR doesn't allow packets to carry routing information, so malicious nodes cannot deduce topology information and launch various attacks based on that. The protocol can also establish multiple node-disjoint routes in a route discovery attempt and exclude unreliable routes before transmitting packets. We formally prove that THMR is loop-free and topology-hiding. Simulation results show that our protocol has better capability of finding routes and can greatly increase the capability of delivering packets in the scenario where there are attackers at the cost of low routing overhead.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "New Jersey Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yujun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yujun", "Guiling Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guiling", "Qi Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Qi", "Zhongcheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhongcheng", "Jie Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0002:Jie"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
