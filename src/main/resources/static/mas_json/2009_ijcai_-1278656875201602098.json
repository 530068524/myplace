For CP-nets and related comparative preference formalisms, inferring a preference of \u03b1 over \u03b2 using the standard definition of derived preference appears to be extremely hard, and has been proved to be PSPACE-complete in general for CP-nets. Such inference is also rather conservative, only making the assumption of transitivity. This paper defines a less conservative approach to inference which can be applied for very general forms of input. It is shown to be efficient for expressive comparative preference languages, allowing comparisons between arbitrary partial tuples (including complete assignments), and with the preferences being ceteris paribus or not.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University College Cork"], "authors": ["Nic Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Nic"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
