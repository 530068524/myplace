{"title": "G-OLA: Generalized On-Line Aggregation for Interactive Analysis on Big Data.", "fields": ["spark", "online aggregation", "online analytical processing", "execution model", "dashboard"], "abstract": "Nearly 15 years ago, Hellerstein, Haas and Wang proposed online aggregation (OLA), a technique that allows users to (1) observe the progress of a query by showing iteratively refined approximate answers, and (2) stop the query execution once its result achieves the desired accuracy. In this demonstration, we present G-OLA, a novel mini-batch execution model that generalizes OLA to support general OLAP queries with arbitrarily nested aggregates using efficient delta maintenance techniques. We have implemented G-OLA in FluoDB, a parallel online query execution framework that is built on top of the Spark cluster computing framework that can scale to massive data sets. We will demonstrate FluoDB on a cluster of 100 machines processing roughly 10TB of real-world session logs from a video-sharing website. Using an ad optimization and an A/B testing based scenario, we will enable users to perform real-time data analysis via web-based query consoles and dashboards.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Databricks Inc. ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Databricks Inc. ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kai Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng_0002:Kai", "Sameer Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Sameer", "Ankur Dave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dave:Ankur", "Michael Armbrust.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Armbrust:Michael", "Ion Stoica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoica:Ion"], "pages": 6}
