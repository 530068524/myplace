When the wheel is turned, the screen content could change its orientation to increase the readability and therefore reduce the distraction from the road. Thus, this paper describes three different content rotation behaviors for steering wheel displays. To investigate what effect these behaviors have on the driver in terms of visual distraction from the road we conducted a user study with eye tracking asking participants to read the current speed. We found no differences in terms of distraction and response time between the different rotation behaviors. Compared to a similar display in a dashboard position the visual distraction was reduced.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg"], "authors": ["David Wilfinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilfinger:David", "Martin Murer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murer:Martin", "Sebastian Osswald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osswald:Sebastian", "Alexander Meschtscherjakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meschtscherjakov:Alexander", "Manfred Tscheligi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tscheligi:Manfred"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
