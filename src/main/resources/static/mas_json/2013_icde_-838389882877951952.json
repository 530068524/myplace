Given a (long) string S and a query point q in the string, can we find a shortest substring containing q that is unique in S? We illustrate that shortest unique substring queries have many potential applications, such as information retrieval, bioinformatics, and event context analysis. We develop efficient algorithms for online query answering. First, we present an algorithm to answer a shortest unique substring query in O(n) time using a suffix tree index, where n is the length of string S. Second, we show that, using O(n\u00b7h) time and O(n) space, we can compute a shortest unique substring for every position in a given string, where h is variable theoretically in O(n) but on real data sets often much smaller than n and can be treated as a constant. Once the shortest unique substrings are pre-computed, shortest unique substring queries can be answered online in constant time. In addition to the solid algorithmic results, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of shortest unique substring queries on real data sets.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Inst. of Inf.
