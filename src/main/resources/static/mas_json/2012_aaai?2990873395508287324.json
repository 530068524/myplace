Our analysis studies the runtime in dependence of the number of inner points k and shows that simple evolutionary algorithms solve the Euclidean TSP in expected time O(n4k(2k -- 1)!). Moreover, we show that, under reasonable geometric constraints, a locally optimal 2-opt tour can be found by randomized local search in expected time O(n2k!).", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide"], "authors": ["Andrew M.
