Since ACs enable to estimate models from fewer correspondences, its use can dramatically reduce the number of combinations during the iterative step of sample-and-test that exists in most SfM pipelines. However, using ACs instead of PCs as input for SfM passes by fully understanding the relations between ACs and multi-view geometry, as well as by establishing practical, effective AC-based algorithms. This article is a step forward into this direction, by providing a clear account about how ACs constrain the two-view geometry, and by proposing new algorithms for plane segmentation and visual odometry that compare favourably with respect to methods relying in PCs.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Coimbra", "University of Coimbra"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Carolina Raposo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raposo:Carolina", "Joao P.
