Many distributed applications are reactive. Yet, existing change propagation algorithms are not suitable in a distributed setting.   We propose Distributed REScala, a reactive language with a change propagation algorithm that works without centralized knowledge about the topology of the dependency structure among reactive values and avoids unnecessary propagation of changes, while retaining safety guarantees ( glitch freedom ). Distributed REScala enables distributed reactive programming, bringing the benefits of reactive programming to distributed applications. We demonstrate the enabled design improvements by a case study. We also empirically evaluate the performance of our algorithm in comparison to other algorithms in a simulated distributed setting.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Joscha Drechsler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drechsler:Joscha", "Guido Salvaneschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salvaneschi:Guido", "Ragnar Mogk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mogk:Ragnar", "Mira Mezini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mezini:Mira"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2014", "pages": 16}
