{"title": "Grounded Language Learning from Video Described with Sentences.", "fields": ["clips", "verb", "noun", "natural language processing", "language acquisition"], "abstract": "We present a method that learns representations for word meanings from short video clips paired with sentences. Unlike prior work on learning language from symbolic input, our input consists of video of people interacting with multiple complex objects in outdoor environments. Unlike prior computer-vision approaches that learn from videos with verb labels or images with noun labels, our labels are sentences containing nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs. The correspondence between words and concepts in the video is learned in an unsupervised fashion, even when the video depicts simultaneous events described by multiple sentences or when different aspects of a single event are described with multiple sentences. The learned word meanings can be subsequently used to automatically generate description of new video.", "citation": "Citations (121)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Haonan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Haonan", "Jeffrey Mark Siskind.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siskind:Jeffrey_Mark"], "pages": 11}
