{"title": "Propositional Dynamic Logic for Higher-Order Functional Programs.", "fields": ["tree traversal", "bounded function", "game semantics", "pointer", "path expression"], "abstract": "We present an extension of propositional dynamic logic called HOT-PDL for specifying temporal properties of higher-order functional programs. The semantics of HOT-PDL is defined over Higher-Order Traces (HOTs) that model execution traces of higher-order programs. A HOT is a sequence of events such as function calls and returns, equipped with two kinds of pointers inspired by the notion of justification pointers from game semantics: one for capturing the correspondence between call and return events, and the other for capturing higher-order control flow involving a function that is passed to or returned by a higher-order function. To allow traversal of the new kinds of pointers, HOT-PDL extends PDL with new path expressions. The extension enables HOT-PDL to specify interesting properties of higher-order programs, including stack-based access control properties and those definable using dependent refinement types. We show that HOT-PDL model checking of higher-order functional programs over bounded integers is decidable via a reduction to modal \\(\\mu \\)-calculus model checking of higher-order recursion schemes.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Yuki Satake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satake:Yuki", "Hiroshi Unno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unno_0001:Hiroshi"], "pages": 19}
