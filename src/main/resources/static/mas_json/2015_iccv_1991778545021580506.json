Towards this goal, we take advantage of convolutional neural nets and train them to directly predict instance-level segmentations where the instance ID encodes the depth ordering within image patches. To provide a coherent single explanation of an image we develop a Markov random field which takes as input the predictions of convolutional neural nets applied at overlapping patches of different resolutions, as well as the output of a connected component algorithm. It aims to predict accurate instance-level segmentation and depth ordering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging KITTI benchmark and show good performance on both tasks.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ziyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ziyu", "Alexander G.
