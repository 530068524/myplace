{"title": "Regular Tree Grammars as a Formalism for Scope Underspecification.", "fields": ["rule based machine translation", "theoretical computer science", "formalism", "ambiguity", "underspecification"], "abstract": "We propose the use of regular tree grammars (RTGs) as a formalism for the underspecified processing of scope ambiguities. By applying standard results on RTGs, we obtain a novel algorithm for eliminating equivalent readings and the first efficient algorithm for computing the best reading of a scope ambiguity. We also show how to derive RTGs from more traditional underspecified descriptions.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Alexander Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Alexander", "Michaela Regneri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regneri:Michaela", "Stefan Thater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thater:Stefan"], "pages": 9}
