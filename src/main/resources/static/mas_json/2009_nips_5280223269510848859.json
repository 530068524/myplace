{"title": "Complexity of Decentralized Control: Special Cases.", "fields": ["observable", "decentralised system", "mathematical optimization", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The worst-case complexity of general decentralized POMDPs, which are equivalent to partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) is very high, both for the cooperative and competitive cases. Some reductions in complexity have been achieved by exploiting independence relations in some models. We show that these results are somewhat limited: when these independence assumptions are relaxed in very small ways, complexity returns to that of the general case.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Connecticut College", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Martin Allen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allen:Martin", "Shlomo Zilberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zilberstein:Shlomo"], "pages": 9}
