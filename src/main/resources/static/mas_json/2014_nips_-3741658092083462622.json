For this common subclass of inference tasks, we consider low-rank relaxations that interpolate between the discrete problem and its full-rank semidefinite relaxation. We develop new theoretical bounds studying the effect of rank, showing that as the rank grows, the relaxed objective increases but saturates, and that the fraction in objective value retained by the rounded discrete solution decreases. In practice, we show two algorithms for optimizing the low-rank objectives which are simple to implement, enjoy ties to the underlying theory, and outperform existing approaches on benchmark MAP inference tasks.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Roy Frostig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frostig:Roy", "Sida I.
