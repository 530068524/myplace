This paper addresses the problem of creating a context-sensitive interprocedural version of CRA that handles recursive procedures. The problem is non-trivial because there is an \u00e2  impedance mismatch\u00e2   between CRA, which relies on analysis techniques based on  regular languages  (i.e., Tarjan\u00e2  s path-expression method), and the  context-free-language underpinnings  of context-sensitive analysis.   We show how to address this impedance mismatch by augmenting the CRA abstract domain with additional operations. We call the resulting algorithm Interprocedural CRA (ICRA). Our experiments with ICRA show that it has broad overall strength compared with several state-of-the-art software model checkers.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Zachary Kincaid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kincaid:Zachary", "Jason Breck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Breck:Jason", "Ashkan Forouhi Boroujeni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boroujeni:Ashkan_Forouhi", "Thomas W.
