The first barrier to a wider adoption is the fact that it is hard both for authors to derive a compendium that encapsulates all the components needed to reproduce a result and for reviewers to verify the results. In this tutorial, we will present a series of guidelines and, through hands-on examples, review existing tools to help authors create of reproducible results. We will also outline open problems and new directions for database-related research having to do with querying computational experiments.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["New York University", "IT University of Copenhagen", "New York University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Juliana Freire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freire:Juliana", "Philippe Bonnet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonnet:Philippe", "Dennis E.
