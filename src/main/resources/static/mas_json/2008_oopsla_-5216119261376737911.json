{"title": "The impact of static-dynamic coupling on remodularization.", "fields": ["modular design", "subject oriented programming", "java", "code refactoring", "modular programming"], "abstract": "We explore the concept of  static-dynamic coupling --the degree to which changes in a program's static modular structure imply changes to its dynamic structure. This paper investigates the impact of static-dynamic coupling in a programming language on the effort required to evolve the coarse modular structure of programs written in that language. We performed a series of remodularization case studies in both Java and SubjectJ. SubjectJ is designed to be similar to Java, but have strictly less static-dynamic coupling. Our results include quantitative measures-time taken and number of bugs introduced--as well as a more subjective qualitative analysis of the remodularization process. All results point in the same direction and suggest that static-dynamic coupling causes substantial accidental complexity for the remodularization of Java programs.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Rick Chern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chern:Rick", "Kris De Volder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Volder:Kris_De"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2008", "pages": 16}
