{"title": "Social Role Discovery in Human Events.", "fields": ["ground truth", "inference", "conditional random field", "computer vision", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We deal with the problem of recognizing social roles played by people in an event. Social roles are governed by human interactions, and form a fundamental component of human event description. We focus on a weakly supervised setting, where we are provided different videos belonging to an event class, without training role labels. Since social roles are described by the interaction between people in an event, we propose a Conditional Random Field to model the inter-role interactions, along with person specific social descriptors. We develop tractable variational inference to simultaneously infer model weights, as well as role assignment to all people in the videos. We also present a novel YouTube social roles dataset with ground truth role annotations, and introduce annotations on a subset of videos from the TRECVID-MED11 [1] event kits for evaluation purposes. The performance of the model is compared against different baseline methods on these datasets.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Vignesh Ramanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanathan:Vignesh", "Bangpeng Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Bangpeng", "Fei-Fei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fei=Fei"], "pages": 8}
