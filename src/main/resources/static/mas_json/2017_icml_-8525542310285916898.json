{"title": "McGan: Mean and Covariance Feature Matching GAN.", "fields": ["machine learning", "generative grammar", "matching", "feature vector", "covariance"], "abstract": "We introduce new families of Integral Probability Metrics (IPM) for training Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our IPMs are based on matching statistics of distributions embedded in a finite dimensional feature space. Mean and covariance feature matching IPMs allow for stable training of GANs, which we will call McGan. McGan minimizes a meaningful loss between distributions.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Youssef Mroueh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mroueh:Youssef", "Tom Sercu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sercu:Tom", "Vaibhava Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Vaibhava"], "pages": 9}
