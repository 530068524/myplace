Usually the choice of which plan to use to achieve a particular goal is left up to the system to determine. In this paper we show how preferences, which can be set by the user of the system, can be incorporated into the BDI execution process and used to guide the choices made.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "RMIT University", "RMIT University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Simeon Visser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Visser:Simeon", "John Thangarajah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thangarajah:John", "James Harland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harland:James"], "pages": 6}
