Preliminary studies show that random job placement with adaptive routing should be the rule of thumb to utilize such networks, since it uniformly distributes traffic and alleviates congestion. Nevertheless, in this work we find that while random job placement coupled with adaptive routing is good at load balancing network traffic, it cannot guarantee the best performance for every job. The performance improvement of communication-intensive applications comes at the expense of performance degradation of less intensive ones. We identify this bully behavior and validate its underlying causes with the help of detailed network simulation and real application traces. We further investigate a hybrid contiguous-noncontiguous job placement policy as an alternative. Initial experimentation shows that hybrid job placement aids in reducing the worst-case performance degradation for less communication-intensive applications while retaining the performance of communication-intensive ones.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Xu Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xu", "John Jenkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jenkins:John", "Misbah Mubarak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mubarak:Misbah", "Robert B.
