{"title": "A user study of different gameplay visualizations.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "popularity", "correctness", "multimedia", "visualization"], "abstract": "With the rising interest in multiplayer gaming, gameplay statistics have become an increasingly important aspect of the overall game experience for many players. As a part of this trend, visualizations have gained great popularity among players, in particular heatmaps since they allow them to reenact the course of a game and to develop new strategies. In this paper we report results of a user study conducted with 29 players (i) to investigate how players use heatmaps and two further graphical representations that use clustering algorithms to interpret gameplay and (ii) to assess the three representations in regard to time efficiency, correctness, suitability, and player preference. Our results show that heatmaps were mainly used to detect hot spots while the cluster representations proved useful to compare variables, allowing the players to uncover relationships between them and in turn allowing a deeper insight into the gameplay data.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Vienna", "University of Vienna", "Institute of Ar ...
