While the field of Persuasive Technologies searches for ways to change attitudes and behaviors, it often neglects the science of self-control. We present the  Chocolate Machine , an exploratory interactive product to train self-control strength based upon  Ego Depletion  theory. A field study showed the machine to increase perceived self-control over time, while providing a sustained positive experience. This makes the machine  transformational , aiming at facilitating behaviors people find worthwhile, but hard to implement.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Koblenz and Landau", "University of Siegen", "Folkwang University of the Arts", "University of Siegen"], "authors": ["Flavius Kehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kehr:Flavius", "Marc Hassenzahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassenzahl:Marc", "Matthias Laschke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laschke:Matthias", "Sarah Diefenbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diefenbach:Sarah"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 6}
