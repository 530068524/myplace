Based on tracklets, we use a manifold learning method Tensor Voting to infer the local geometric structures in (x, y) space, and embed tracklet points into (x, y, \u03b8) space, where \u03b8 represents motion direction. In this space, points automatically form intrinsic manifold structures, each of which corresponds to a motion pattern. To define each group, a novel robustmanifold grouping algorithm is proposed. Tensor Voting is performed to provide multiple geometric cues which formulate multiple similarity kernels between any pair of points, and a spectral clustering technique is used in this multiple kernel setting. The grouping algorithm achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods in our applications. Extracted motion patterns can then be used as a prior to improve the performance of any object tracker. It is especially useful to reduce false alarms and ID switches. Experiments are performed on challenging real-world sequences, and a quantitative analysis of the results shows the framework effectively improves state-of-the-art tracker.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Xuemei Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xuemei", "G\u00e9rard G.
