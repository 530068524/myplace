Despite recent progress on backhaul-aware 4G studies with capacity-limited backhaul links, the performance-limiting impact of backhaul latency and reliability has not been examined in sufficient detail previously. In this paper, we evaluate the maximum aggregate throughput, offloading efficiency, and in particular the delay performance of FiWi enhanced LTE-A heterogeneous networks (HetNets), including the beneficial impact of various localized fiber-lean backhaul redundancy and wireless protection techniques, by means of probabilistic analysis and verifying simulation, paying close attention to fiber backhaul reliability issues and WiFi offloading limitations due to WiFi mesh node failures as well as temporal and spatial WiFi coverage constraints.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Institut national de la recherche scientifique", "Institut national de la recherche scientifique", "Institut national de la recherche scientifique", "Sharif University of Technology"], "authors": ["Hamzeh Beyranvand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beyranvand:Hamzeh", "Martin L\u00e9vesque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=eacute=vesque_0001:Martin", "Martin Maier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maier:Martin", "Jawad A.
