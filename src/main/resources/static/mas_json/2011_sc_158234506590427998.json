{"title": "Scaling lattice QCD beyond 100 GPUs.", "fields": ["scaling", "lattice field theory", "supercomputer", "lattice qcd", "gpu cluster"], "abstract": "Over the past five years, graphics processing units (GPUs) have had a transformational effect on numerical lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations in nuclear and particle physics. While GPUs have been applied with great success to the post-Monte Carlo \"analysis\" phase which accounts for a substantial fraction of the workload in a typical LQCD calculation, the initial Monte Carlo \"gauge field generation\" phase requires capability-level supercomputing, corresponding to O(100) GPUs or more. Such strong scaling has not been previously achieved. In this contribution, we demonstrate that using a multi-dimensional parallelization strategy and a domain-decomposed preconditioner allows us to scale into this regime. We present results for two popular discretizations of the Dirac operator, Wilson-clover and improved staggered, employing up to 256 GPUs on the Edge cluster at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Boston University", "National Center for Supercomputing Applications", "Harvard University", "Boston University", "Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility"], "authors": ["Ronald Babich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babich:Ronald", "Michael A.
