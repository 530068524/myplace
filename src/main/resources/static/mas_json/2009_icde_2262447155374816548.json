{"title": "X-CSR: Dataflow Optimization for Distributed XML Process Pipelines.", "fields": ["xml framework", "streaming xml", "xml validation", "xml schema", "efficient xml interchange"], "abstract": "XML process networks are a simple, yet powerful programming paradigm for loosely coupled, coarse-grained dataflow applications such as data-centric scientific workflows. We describe a framework called Delta-XML that is well-suited for applications in which pipelines of data processors modify parts (\"deltas'') of XML data collections while keeping the overall collection structure intact. We show how to optimize the execution of Delta-XML process networks by minimizing the data shipping cost in distributed settings. This X-CSR** optimization employs static type inference based on XML Schema to determine the XML stream fragments that are relevant to a processor, allowing irrelevant fragments to be bypassed (\"shipped'') to downstream pipeline steps. Finally, we present evaluation results for a real-world scientific workflow, which shows the practical feasibility of X-CSR.
