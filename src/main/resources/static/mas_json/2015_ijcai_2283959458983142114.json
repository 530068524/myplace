{"title": "On Conceptual Labeling of a Bag of Words.", "fields": ["minimum description length", "question answering", "ranging", "semantic network", "bag of words model"], "abstract": "In natural language processing and information retrieval, the bag of words representation is used to implicitly represent the meaning of the text. Implicit semantics, however, are insufficient in supporting text or natural language based interfaces, which are adopted by an increasing number of applications. Indeed, in applications ranging from automatic ontology construction to question answering, explicit representation of semantics is starting to play a more prominent role. In this paper, we introduce the task of conceptual labeling (CL), which aims at generating a minimum set of conceptual labels that best summarize a bag of words. We draw the labels from a data driven semantic network that contains millions of highly connected concepts. The semantic network provides meaning to the concepts, and in turn, it provides meaning to the bag of words through the conceptual labels we generate. To achieve our goal, we use an information theoretic approach to trade-off the semantic coverage of a bag of words against the minimality of the output labels. Specifically, we use Minimum Description Length (MDL) as the criteria in selecting the best concepts. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in representing the explicit semantics of a bag of words.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Google", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Xiangyan Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Xiangyan", "Yanghua Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Yanghua", "Haixun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haixun", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0009:Wei"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
