{"title": "Inference Graphs: Combining Natural Deduction and Subsumption Inference in a Concurrent Reasoner.", "fields": ["semantic reasoner", "judgment", "speedup", "sneps", "natural deduction"], "abstract": "There are very few reasoners which combine natural deduction and subsumption reasoning, and there are none which do so while supporting concurrency. Inference Graphs are a graph-based inference mechanism using an expressive first- order logic, capable of subsumption and natural deduction reasoning using concurrency. Evaluation of concurrency characteristics on a combination natural deduction and sub-sumption reasoning problem has shown linear speedup with the number of processors.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Daniel R.
