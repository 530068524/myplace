{"title": "Active Learning from Oracle with Knowledge Blind Spot.", "fields": ["oracle", "oracle unified method", "descriptive knowledge", "blind spot", "active learning"], "abstract": "Active learning traditionally assumes that an oracle is capable of providing labeling information for each query instance. This paper formulates a new research problem which allows an oracle admit that he/she is incapable of labeling some query instances or simply answer \"I don't know the label\". We define a unified objective function to ensure that each query instance submitted to the oracle is the one mostly needed for labeling and the oracle should also has the knowledge to label. Experiments based on different types of knowledge blind spot (KBS) models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "authors": ["Meng Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Meng", "Xingquan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xingquan", "Chengqi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chengqi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
