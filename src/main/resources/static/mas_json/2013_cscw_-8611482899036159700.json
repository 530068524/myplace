The organization is entirely virtual, relying on ICT to both organize and execute its work of helping to inform the public on how to survive after disaster events. This paper follows the trajectory of Humanity Road from an emergent group to a formal non-profit, considering how its articulation, conduct and products of work together express its identity and purpose, which include aspirations of relating to and changing the larger ecosystem of emergency response. Through excerpts of its communications, we consider how the organization makes changes in order to sustain itself in rapid-response work supported in large part by episodic influxes of volunteers. This case enlightens discussion about technology-supported civic participation, and the means by which dedicated long-term commitment to the civic sphere is mobilized.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Kate Starbird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starbird:Kate", "Leysia Palen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palen:Leysia"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
