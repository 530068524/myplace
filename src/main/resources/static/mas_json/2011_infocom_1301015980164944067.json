This can result in frequent video freezes under varying network dynamics. In this paper, we present CloudStream: a cloud-based video proxy that can deliver high-quality streaming videos by transcoding the original video in real time to a scalable codec which allows streaming adaptation to network dynamics. The key is a multi-level transcoding parallelization framework with two mapping options (Hallsh-based Mapping and Lateness-first Mapping) that optimize transcoding speed and reduce the transcoding jitters while preserving the encoded video quality. We evaluate the performance of CloudStream on our campus cloud testbed.", "citation": "Citations (194)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Zixia Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zixia", "Chao Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Chao", "Li Erran Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Li_Erran", "Thomas Woo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woo:Thomas"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
