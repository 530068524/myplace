Although Zobrist hashing, the standard hash function used by HDA*, achieves good load balance for many domains, it incurs significant communication overhead since it requires many node transfers among threads. We propose Abstract Zobrist hashing, a new work distribution method for parallel search which reduces node transfers and mitigates communication overhead by using feature projection functions. We evaluate Abstract Zobrist hashing for multicore HDA*, and show that it significantly outperforms previous work distribution methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Yuu Jinnai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jinnai:Yuu", "Alex Fukunaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukunaga:Alex"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
