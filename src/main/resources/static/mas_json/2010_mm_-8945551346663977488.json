This demonstrator provides an overview of our novel approach to the definition of virtual characters aimed at achieving a balance between character autonomy and global plot structure which proposes the notion of a character's Point of View. Additionally, the demonstrator offers the active spectator the ability to discover the story described from the perspective of a number of different characters. We present our fully-implemented Interactive Narrative based on Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. The system, which features a novel AI planning approach to story generation, can generate very different stories depending on the Point of View adopted and support dynamic modification of the story world which results in different story consequences.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Teesside University", "Teesside University", "Teesside University"], "authors": ["Fred Charles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charles:Fred", "Julie Porteous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porteous:Julie", "Marc Cavazza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cavazza:Marc"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
