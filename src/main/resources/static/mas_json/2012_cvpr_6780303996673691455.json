{"title": "Improving multi-target tracking via social grouping.", "fields": ["sensor fusion", "k means clustering", "sensory cue", "global optimization", "hungarian algorithm"], "abstract": "We address the problem of multi-person data-association-based tracking (DAT) in semi-crowded environments from a single camera. Existing tracklet-association-based methods using purely visual cues (like appearance and motion information) show impressive results but rely on heavy training, a number of tuned parameters, and sophisticated detectors to cope with visual ambiguities within the video and low-level processing errors. In this work, we consider clustering dynamics to mitigate such ambiguities. This leads to a general optimization framework that adds social grouping behavior (SGB) to any basic affinity model. We formulate this as a nonlinear global optimization problem to maximize the consistency of visual and grouping cues for trajectories in both tracklet-tracklet linking space and tracklet-grouping assignment space. We formulate the Lagrange dual and solve it using a two-stage iterative algorithm, employing the Hungarian algorithm and K-means clustering. We build SGB upon a simple affinity model and show very promising performance on two publicly available real-world datasets with different tracklet extraction methods.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhen Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Zhen", "Christian R.
