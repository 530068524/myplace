In a voice-based search setting, the compilation of query suggestions is not straightforward, and user-centric research targeting query underspecification is lacking so far. Our paper analyses a specific type of ambiguous voice queries and studies the impact of various kinds of voice query clarifications offered by the system and its impact on user satisfaction. We conduct a user study that measures the satisfaction for clarifications that are explicitly invoked and presented by seven different methods. Our findings include that (1) user experience depends on language proficiency levels, (2) users are not dissatisfied when prompted for clarifications (in fact, enjoy it sometimes), and (3) the most effective way of query clarification depends on the number and lengths of the possible answers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Bauhaus University, Weimar", "Bauhaus University, Weimar", "Bauhaus University, Weimar", "Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany"], "authors": ["Johannes Kiesel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiesel:Johannes", "Arefeh Bahrami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bahrami:Arefeh", "Benno Stein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stein:Benno", "Avishek Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Avishek", "Matthias Hagen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hagen:Matthias"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
