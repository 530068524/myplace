We use multiple kernel learning of Varma and Ray (ICCV 2007) to learn an optimal combination of exponential \u03c7 2  kernels, each of which captures a different feature channel. Our features include the distribution of edges, dense and sparse visual words, and feature descriptors at different levels of spatial organization.", "citation": "Citations (846)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Microsoft", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Andrea Vedaldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vedaldi:Andrea", "Varun Gulshan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gulshan:Varun", "Manik Varma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varma:Manik", "Andrew Zisserman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zisserman:Andrew"], "pages": 8}
