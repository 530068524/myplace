{"title": "False rumors detection on Sina Weibo by propagation structures.", "fields": ["social media", "microblogging", "feature vector", "rumor", "social network"], "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of automatic detection of false rumors on Sina Weibo, the popular Chinese microblogging social network. Traditional feature-based approaches extract features from the false rumor message, its author, as well as the statistics of its responses to form a flat feature vector. This ignores the propagation structure of the messages and has not achieved very good results. We propose a graph-kernel based hybrid SVM classifier which captures the high-order propagation patterns in addition to semantic features such as topics and sentiments. The new model achieves a classification accuracy of 91.3% on randomly selected Weibo dataset, significantly higher than state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our approach can be applied at the early stage of rumor propagation and is 88% confident in detecting an average false rumor just 24 hours after the initial broadcast.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Ke Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ke", "Song Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Song", "Kenny Q.
