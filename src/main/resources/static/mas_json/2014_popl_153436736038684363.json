Current methods, using weighted transition systems or energy games, model the energy source as an ideal resource whose status is characterized by one number, namely the amount of remaining energy. Real batteries, however, exhibit behaviors that can deviate substantially from an ideal energy resource. Based on a discretization of a standard continuous battery model, we introduce {\\em battery transition systems}. In this model, a battery is viewed as consisting of two parts -- the available-charge tank and the bound-charge tank. Any charge or discharge is applied to the available-charge tank. Over time, the energy from each tank diffuses to the other tank.   Battery transition systems are infinite state systems that, being not well-structured, fall into no decidable class that is known to us. Nonetheless, we are able to prove that the $\\omega$-regular model-checking problem is decidable for battery transition systems. We also present a case study on the verification of control programs for energy-constrained semi-autonomous robots.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "authors": ["Udi Boker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boker:Udi", "Thomas A.
