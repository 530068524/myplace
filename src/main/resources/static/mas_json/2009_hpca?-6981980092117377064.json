{"title": "Architectural Contesting.", "fields": ["real time computing", "workload", "microarchitecture", "parallel computing", "computer science"], "abstract": "This paper presents results showing that workload behavior tends to vary considerably at granularities of less than a thousand instructions. If it were possible to adjust the microarchitecture to suit the workload behavior at such rates, significant single-thread performance enhancement would be achievable. However, previous techniques are too sluggish to be able to effectively respond to such fine-grain change.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Hashem Hashemi Najaf-abadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Najaf=abadi:Hashem_Hashemi", "Eric Rotenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rotenberg:Eric"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
