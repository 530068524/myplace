We first investigate multi-channel realities in WSNs through intensive empirical experiments with Micaz motes. Our study shows that current multi-channel protocols are not suitable for WSNs, because of the small number of available channels and unavoidable time errors found in real networks. With these observations, we propose a novel tree-based multichannel scheme for data collection applications, which allocates channels to disjoint trees and exploits parallel transmissions among trees. In order to minimize interference within trees, we define a new channel assignment problem which is proven NP- complete. Then we propose a greedy channel allocation algorithm which outperforms other schemes in dense networks with a small number of channels.We implement our protocol, called TMCP, in a real testbed. Through both simulation and real experiments, we show that TMCP can significantly improve network throughput and reduce packet losses. More importantly, evaluation results show that TMCP better accommodates multi-channel realities found in WSNs than other multi-channel protocols.", "citation": "Citations (443)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "Computer Scienc ... and Engineering"], "authors": ["Yafeng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yafeng", "John A.
