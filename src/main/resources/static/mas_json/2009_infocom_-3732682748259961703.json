Result shows that predecessor attack (26) is much more difficult to succeed compared with Crowds (20). We are able to reduce the estimated number of rounds needed for successful predecessor attack for MIX-Crowds. We also propose a file transfer strategy according to file size. With such strategy, requests for small size files can be completed faster while the downloading time of large size files only increases slightly. I.
