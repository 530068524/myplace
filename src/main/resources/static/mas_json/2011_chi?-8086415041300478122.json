{"title": "The information flaneur: a fresh look at information seeking.", "fields": ["immersion", "information seeking", "abstraction", "metaphor", "continuum"], "abstract": "We introduce the information flaneur as a new human-centred view on information seeking that is grounded in interdisciplinary research. We use the metaphor of the urban flaneur making sense of a city as an inspiring lens that brings together diverse perspectives. These perspectives shift information seeking towards a more optimistic outlook: the information flaneur represents curious, creative, and critical information seeking. The resulting information-seeking model conceptualizes the interrelated nature between information activities and experiences as a continuum between horizontal exploration and vertical immersion. Motivated by enabling technological trends and inspired by the information flaneur, we present explorability as a new guiding principle for design and raise research challenges regarding the representation of information abstractions and details.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Marian D\u00f6rk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=ouml=rk:Marian", "Sheelagh Carpendale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carpendale:Sheelagh", "Carey Williamson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williamson:Carey"], "pages": 10}
