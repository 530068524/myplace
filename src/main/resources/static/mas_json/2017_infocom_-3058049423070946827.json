We introduce the first scalable, parallelizable algorithm with performance guarantee for TAP suitable for datasets with millions of nodes and edges; we exploit the bicriteria nature of solutions to TAP to allow the user to control the running time versus accuracy of our algorithm through a parameter \u03b1 \u220a (0, 1): given \u03b7 > 0, with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b7 our algorithm returns a solution A with expected activation greater than T \u2014 2\u03b1\u03a4, and the size of the solution A is within factor 1\u2212h 4\u03b1\u03a4 + log(T) of the optimal size. The algorithm runs in time O (\u03b1 \u22122  log (n/\u03b7) (n + m)|A|), where n, m, refer to the number of nodes, edges in the network. The performance guarantee holds for the general triggering model of internal influence and also incorporates external influence, provided a certain condition is met on the cost-effectivity of seed selection.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Alan Kuhnle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhnle:Alan", "Tianyi Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Tianyi", "Md Abdul Alim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alim:Md_Abdul", "My T.
