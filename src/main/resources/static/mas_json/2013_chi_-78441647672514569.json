We shift the focus from the recreational elements of this practice to the ways in which it democratizes design and manufacturing. This  democratized technological practice , we argue, unifies playfulness, utility, and expressiveness, relying on some industrial infrastructures while creating demand for new types of tools and literacies. Thriving on top of collaborative digital systems, the Maker movement both implicates and impacts professional designers. As users move more towards personalization and reappropriation, new design opportunities are created for HCI.", "citation": "Citations (273)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Wyld Collective ...
