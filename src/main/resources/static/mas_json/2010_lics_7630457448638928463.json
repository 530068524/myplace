In this paper, we study the complexity of Parikh\u2019s Theorem over any fixed alphabet size d. We prove various normal form the oremsin the case of NFAs and CFGs. In particular, the normalform theorems ensure that a union of linear sets with dgenerators suffice to express such Parikh images, which in the case of NFAs can further be computed in polynomial time. We then apply apply our results to derive: (1) optimal complexity for decision problems concerning Parikh images(e.g. membership, universality, equivalence, and disjointness), (2) a new polynomial fragment of integer programming, (3) an answer to an open question about PAC-learnability of semilinear sets, and (4) an optimal algorithm for verifying LTL over discrete-timed reversal-bounded counter systems.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Eryk Kopczynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopczynski:Eryk", "Anthony Widjaja To.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/To:Anthony_Widjaja"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
