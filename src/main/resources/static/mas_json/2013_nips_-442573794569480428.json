Our model extends the popular setup in Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995) to allow for the data-driven classification of agents' types using agent-level data. We focus on applications involving data on agents' ranking over alternatives, and present theoretical conditions that establish the identifiability of the model and uni-modality of the likelihood/posterior. Results on both real and simulated data provide support for the scalability of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Hossein Azari Soufiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soufiani:Hossein_Azari", "Hansheng Diao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diao:Hansheng", "Zhenyu Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Zhenyu", "David C.
