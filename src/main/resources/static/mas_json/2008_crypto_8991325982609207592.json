We generalize this primitive to the dynamic setting, where any user can  dynamically join the system, as a possible recipient; the sender can  dynamically choose the authorized set of recipients, for each ciphertext; and the sender can  dynamically set the threshold  t for decryption capability among the authorized set. We first give a formal security model, which includes strong robustness notions, and then we propose a candidate achieving all the above dynamic properties, that is semantically secure in the standard model, under a new non-interactive assumption, that fits into the general Diffie-Hellman exponent framework on groups with a bilinear map. It furthermore compares favorably with previous proposals,  a.k.a. threshold broadcast encryption, since this is the first threshold public-key encryption, with dynamic authorized set of recipients and dynamic threshold that provides constant-size ciphertexts.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["C\u00e9cile Delerabl\u00e9e.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delerabl=eacute=e:C=eacute=cile", "David Pointcheval.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pointcheval:David"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 18}
