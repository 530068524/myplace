High variability has become important because of current trends towards software systems that come in product families, offer high levels of personalization, and fit well within a service-oriented architecture. The purpose of our research is to propose a framework that exploits such variability to allow a software system to self-repair in cases of failure. We propose an autonomic architecture that consists of monitoring, diagnosis, reconfiguration and execution components. This architecture uses requirements models as a basis for monitoring, diagnosis, and reconfiguration. We illustrate our proposal with a medium-sized publicly available case study (an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) simulation), and evaluate its performance through a series of experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate that it is feasible to scale our approach to software systems with medium-size requirements.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Yiqiao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Yiqiao", "John Mylopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mylopoulos:John"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
