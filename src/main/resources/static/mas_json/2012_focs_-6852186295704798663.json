[KLM94]). A gate has a short-circuit error when the value it computes is replaced by the value of one of its inputs. We guarantee that E computes the same function as F, as long as at most (1/10 - e) of the gates on each path from the output to an input have been corrupted in E. The corruptions may be chosen adversarially, and may depend on the formula E and even on the input. We obtain our result by extending the Karchmer-Wigderson connection between formulas and communication protocols to the setting of adversarial error. This enables us to obtain error-resilient formulas from error-resilient communication protocols.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Washington"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Yael Tauman Kalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalai:Yael_Tauman", "Allison B.
