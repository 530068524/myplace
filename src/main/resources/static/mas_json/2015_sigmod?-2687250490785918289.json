{"title": "PAXQuery: Parallel Analytical XML Processing.", "fields": ["analytics", "xquery", "massively parallel", "xml database", "processing instruction"], "abstract": "XQuery is a general-purpose programming language for processing semi-structured data, and as such, it is very expressive. As a consequence, optimizing and parallelizing complex analytics XQuery queries is still an open, challenging problem.   We demonstrate PAXQuery, a novel system that parallelizes the execution of XQuery queries over large collections of XML documents. PAXQuery compiles a rich subset of XQuery into plans expressed in the PArallelization ConTracts (PACT) programming model. Thanks to this translation, the resulting plans are optimized and executed in a massively parallel fashion by the Apache Flink system. The result is a scalable system capable of querying massive amounts of XML data very efficiently, as proved by the experimental results we outline.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University", "University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud", "Hortonworks Inc ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jes\u00fas Camacho-Rodr\u00edguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camacho=Rodr=iacute=guez:Jes=uacute=s", "Dario Colazzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colazzo:Dario", "Ioana Manolescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manolescu:Ioana", "Juan A.
