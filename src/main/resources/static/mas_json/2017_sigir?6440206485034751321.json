{"title": "Understanding and Modeling Success in Email Search.", "fields": ["heuristics", "survey data collection", "discriminative model", "html email", "dwell time"], "abstract": "Email has been a dominant form of communication for many years, and email search is an important problem. In contrast to other search setting, such as web search, there have been few studies of user behavior and models of email search success. Research in email search is challenging for many reasons including the personal and private nature of the collection. Third party judges can not look at email search queries or email message content requiring new modeling techniques.   In this study, we built an opt-in client application which monitors a user's email search activity and then pops up an in-situ survey when a search session is finished. We then merged the survey data with server-side behavioral logs. This approach allows us to study the relationship between session-level outcome and user behavior, and then build a model to predict success for email search based on behavioral interaction patterns.   Our results show that generative models (MarkovChain) of success can predict the session-level success of email search better than baseline heuristics and discriminative models (RandomForest). The success model makes use of email-specific log activities such as reply, forward and move, as well as generic signals such as click with long dwell time. The learned model is highly interpretable, and reusable in that it can be applied to unlabeled interaction logs in the future.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Snap Inc., Venice, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Jin Young Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0005:Jin_Young", "Nick Craswell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Craswell:Nick", "Susan T.
