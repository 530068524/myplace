{"title": "Draco: bringing life to illustrations with kinetic textures.", "fields": ["repertoire", "sketch", "animation", "casual", "rippling"], "abstract": "We present Draco, a sketch-based interface that allows artists and casual users alike to add a rich set of animation effects to their drawings, seemingly bringing illustrations to life. While previous systems have introduced sketch-based animations for individual objects, our contribution is a unified framework of motion controls that allows users to seamlessly add coordinated motions to object collections. We propose a framework built around  kinetic textures , which provide continuous animation effects while preserving the unique timeless nature of still illustrations. This enables many dynamic effects difficult or not possible with previous sketch-based tools, such as a school of fish swimming, tree leaves blowing in the wind, or water rippling in a pond. We describe our implementation and illustrate the repertoire of animation effects it supports. A user study with professional animators and casual users demonstrates the variety of animations, applications and creative possibilities our tool provides.", "citation": "Citations (44)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "University of Toronto", "Autodesk", "National University of Singapore", "Autodesk"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rubaiat Habib Kazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazi:Rubaiat_Habib", "Fanny Chevalier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chevalier:Fanny", "Tovi Grossman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossman:Tovi", "Shengdong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shengdong", "George W.
