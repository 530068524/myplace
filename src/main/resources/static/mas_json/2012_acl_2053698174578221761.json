{"title": "Discriminative Strategies to Integrate Multiword Expression Recognition and Parsing.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "parsing", "expression", "natural language processing", "multiword expression"], "abstract": "The integration of multiword expressions in a parsing procedure has been shown to improve accuracy in an artificial context where such expressions have been perfectly pre-identified. This paper evaluates two empirical strategies to integrate multiword units in a real constituency parsing context and shows that the results are not as promising as has sometimes been suggested. Firstly, we show that pre-grouping multiword expressions before parsing with a state-of-the-art recognizer improves multiword recognition accuracy and unlabeled attachment score. However, it has no statistically significant impact in terms of F-score as incorrect multiword expression recognition has important side effects on parsing. Secondly, integrating multiword expressions in the parser grammar followed by a reranker specific to such expressions slightly improves all evaluation metrics.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Matthieu Constant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Constant:Matthieu", "Anthony Sigogne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sigogne:Anthony", "Patrick Watrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watrin:Patrick"], "pages": 9}
