{"title": "Exploiting Vector and Multicore Parallelism for Recursive, Data- and Task-Parallel Programs.", "fields": ["asymptotically optimal algorithm", "task parallelism", "speedup", "data parallelism", "implicit parallelism"], "abstract": "Modern hardware contains parallel execution resources that are well-suited for data-parallelism-vector units-and task parallelism-multicores. However, most work on parallel scheduling focuses on one type of hardware or the other. In this work, we present a scheduling framework that allows for a unified treatment of task- and data-parallelism. Our key insight is an abstraction, task blocks, that uniformly handles data-parallel iterations and task-parallel tasks, allowing them to be scheduled on vector units or executed independently as multicores. Our framework allows us to define schedulers that can dynamically select between executing task- blocks on vector units or multicores. We show that these schedulers are asymptotically optimal, and deliver the maximum amount of parallelism available in computation trees. To evaluate our schedulers, we develop program transformations that can convert mixed data- and task-parallel pro- grams into task block-based programs. Using a prototype instantiation of our scheduling framework, we show that, on an 8-core system, we can simultaneously exploit vector and multicore parallelism to achieve 14\u00d7-108\u00d7 speedup over sequential baselines.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Purdue University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Bin Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Bin", "Sriram Krishnamoorthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamoorthy:Sriram", "Kunal Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Kunal", "Milind Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni_0001:Milind"], "pages": 14}
