{"title": "Rules for Choosing Societal Tradeoffs.", "fields": ["logarithm", "hill climbing", "machine learning", "estimator", "maximum likelihood", "mathematical optimization"], "abstract": "We study the societal tradeoffs problem, where a set of voters each submit their ideal tradeoff value between each pair of activities (e.g., \"using a gallon of gasoline is as bad as creating 2 bags of landfill trash\"), and these are then aggregated into the societal tradeoff vector using a rule. We introduce the family of distance-based rules and show that these can be justified as maximum likelihood estimators of the truth. Within this family, we single out the logarithmic distance-based rule as especially appealing based on a social-choice-theoretic axiomatization. We give an efficient algorithm for executing this rule as well as an approximate hill climbing algorithm, and evaluate these experimentally.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Vincent Conitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conitzer:Vincent", "Rupert Freeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freeman:Rupert", "Markus Brill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brill:Markus", "Yuqian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuqian"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
