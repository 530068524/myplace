{"title": "Pick from here!: an interactive mobile cart using in-situ projection for order picking.", "fields": ["order picking", "wearable computer", "augmented reality", "scalability", "cart"], "abstract": "Order Picking is not only one of the most important but also most mentally demanding and error-prone tasks in the industry. Both stationary and wearable systems have been introduced to facilitate this task. Existing stationary systems are not scalable because of the high cost and wearable systems have issues being accepted by the workers. In this paper, we introduce a mobile camera-projector cart called OrderPickAR, which combines the benefits of both stationary and mobile systems to support order picking through Augmented Reality. Our system dynamically projects in-situ picking information into the storage system and automatically detects when a picking task is done. In a lab study, we compare our system to existing approaches, i.e, Pick-by-Paper, Pick-by-Voice, and Pick-by-Vision. The results show that using the proposed system, order picking is almost twice as fast as other approaches, the error rate is decreased up to 9 times, and mental demands are reduced up to 50%.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "Yahoo!", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "authors": ["Markus Funk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Funk:Markus", "Alireza Sahami Shirazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shirazi:Alireza_Sahami", "Sven Mayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayer:Sven", "Lars Lischke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lischke:Lars", "Albrecht Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt_0001:Albrecht"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
