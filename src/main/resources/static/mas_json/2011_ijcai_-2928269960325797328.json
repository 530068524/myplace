However, the application of these disciplines in AI has necessitated the development of many enhancements and extensions. Among the most powerful of these are the methods of computational logic.\n\nI will argue that computational logic, embedded in an agent cycle, combines and improves upon both traditional logic and classical decision theory. I will also argue that many of its methods can be used, not only in AI, but also in ordinary life, to help people improve their own human intelligence without the assistance of computers.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Imperial College London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Robert A.
