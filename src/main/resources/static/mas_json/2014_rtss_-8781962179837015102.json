The problem of executing a MC workload, modeled as a collection of independent implicit-deadline sporadic tasks executing upon a preemptive uniprocessor, is considered. Suitable scheduling strategies are devised for scheduling such systems despite uncertainty and unpredictability in both the amount of execution needed by the tasks, and the effective speed of the processor. These scheduling strategies allow for simultaneously making efficient use of platform resources and ensuring the correctness of the more critical workload components at greater levels of assurance.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Sanjoy K.
