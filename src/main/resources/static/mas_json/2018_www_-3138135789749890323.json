{"title": "Adaptive Sensitive Reweighting to Mitigate Bias in Fairness-aware Classification.", "fields": ["data mining", "weighting", "training set", "software deployment", "disparate impact"], "abstract": "Machine learning bias and fairness have recently emerged as key issues due to the pervasive deployment of data-driven decision making in a variety of sectors and services. It has often been argued that unfair classifications can be attributed to bias in training data, but previous attempts to \u2018repair\u2019 training data have led to limited success. To circumvent shortcomings prevalent in data repairing approaches, e.g. by weighting training samples of the sensitive group (e.g. gender, race, financial status) based on their misclassification error, we present a process that iteratively adapts training sample weights with a theoretically grounded model. This model addresses different kinds of bias to better achieve fairness objectives, such as trade-offs between accuracy and disparate impact elimination or disparate mistreatment elimination. We show that, compared to previous fairness-aware approaches on real-world and synthetic datasets, our methodology achieves better or similar trades-offs between accuracy and unfairness mitigation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Centre of Resea ... loniki, Greece", "Centre of Resea ... loniki, Greece", "Centre of Resea ... loniki, Greece", "Centre of Resea ... loniki, Greece"], "authors": ["Emmanouil Krasanakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krasanakis:Emmanouil", "Eleftherios Spyromitros Xioufis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xioufis:Eleftherios_Spyromitros", "Symeon Papadopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadopoulos:Symeon", "Yiannis Kompatsiaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kompatsiaris:Yiannis"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
