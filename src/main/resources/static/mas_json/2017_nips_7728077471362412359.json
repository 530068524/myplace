We perform exact clustering with high probability using a convex semidefinite estimator that interprets as a corrected, relaxed version of K-means. The estimator is analyzed through a non-asymptotic framework and showed to be optimal or near-optimal in recovering the partition. Furthermore, its performances are shown to be adaptive to the problem\u2019s effective dimension, as well as to K the unknown number of groups in this partition. We illustrate the method\u2019s performances in comparison to other classical clustering algorithms with numerical experiments on simulated high-dimensional data.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Martin Royer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Royer:Martin"], "pages": 9}
