Finding the optimal hash function is difficult because it involves binary constraints, and most approaches approximate the optimization by relaxing the constraints and then binarizing the result. Here, we focus on the binary autoencoder model, which seeks to reconstruct an image from the binary code produced by the hash function. We show that the optimization can be simplified with the method of auxiliary coordinates. This reformulates the optimization as alternating two easier steps: one that learns the encoder and decoder separately, and one that optimizes the code for each image. Image retrieval experiments show the resulting hash function outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for binary hashing.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "University of California, Merced"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Miguel \u00c1.
