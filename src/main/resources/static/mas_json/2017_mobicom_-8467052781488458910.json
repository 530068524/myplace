{"title": "RIO: A Pervasive RFID-based Touch Gesture Interface.", "fields": ["user interface", "swipe", "antenna", "gesture", "internet of things"], "abstract": "In this paper, we design and develop RIO, a novel battery-free touch sensing user interface (UI) primitive for future IoT and smart spaces. RIO enables UIs to be constructed using off-the-shelf RFID readers and tags, and provides a unique approach to designing smart IoT spaces. With RIO, any surface can be turned into a touch-aware surface by simply attaching RFID tags to them. RIO also supports custom-designed RFID tags, and thus allows specially customized UIs to be easily deployed into a real-world environment. RIO is built using the technique of impedance tracking: when a human finger touches the surface of an RFID tag, the impedance of the antenna changes. This change manifests as a change in the phase of the RFID backscattered signal, and is used by RIO to track fine-grained touch movement over both off-the shelf and custom built tags. We study this impedance behavior in-depth and show how RIO is a reliable UI primitive that is robust even within a multi-tag environment. We leverage this primitive to build a prototype of RIO that can continuously locate a finger during a swipe movement to within 3 mm of its actual position. We also show how custom-design RFID tags can be built and used with RIO, and provide two example applications that demonstrate its real-world use.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "University of Texas at Austin", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Swadhin Pradhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pradhan:Swadhin", "Eugene Chai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chai:Eugene", "Karthikeyan Sundaresan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundaresan:Karthikeyan", "Lili Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Lili", "Mohammad Amir Khojastepour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khojastepour:Mohammad_Amir", "Sampath Rangarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangarajan:Sampath"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
