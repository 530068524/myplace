We conducted topic modeling analysis to gain a longitudinal view of the interaction of societal, personal and revolutionary blog topics over this period. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis of blog posts during the period that bracketed the political uprising revealed Egyptian bloggers' concerns. Reporting events and supplying commentary provided bloggers with a means to voice dissent against institutionalized power represented by the government-controlled media. In short, blogs reveal a counter-narrative to the government-supplied version of events in Egypt during the 18-day uprising. These narratives offer rich documentation of how blogs, and perhaps social media more generally, can be utilized by individuals operating under repressive conditions.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Ban Al-Ani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Al=Ani:Ban", "Gloria Mark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mark:Gloria", "Justin Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Justin", "Jennifer Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones:Jennifer"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
