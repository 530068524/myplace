Thus, we lack direction on how to do research on supporting practitioners' analysis and lose an opportunity for practitioners to learn from each other. We have surveyed 155 usability practitioners on the analysis in their latest usability evaluation. Analysis is typically flexible and light-weight. At the same time, practitioners see a need to strengthen reliability in evaluation. Redesign is closely integrated with analysis; more than half of the respondents provide visual redesign suggestions in their evaluation deliverables. Analysis support from academic research, including tools, forms and structured formats, does not seem to have direct impact on analysis practice. We provide six recommendations for future research to better support analysis.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["SINTEF", "University of Leicester", "University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Asbj\u00f8rn F\u00f8lstad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/F=oslash=lstad:Asbj=oslash=rn", "Effie Law.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Law:Effie", "Kasper Hornb\u00e6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hornb=aelig=k:Kasper"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
