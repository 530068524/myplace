One of the principle design objectives in Cloud SQL Server was to provide true SQL support with full ACID transactions within controlled scale \"consistency domains\" and provide a relaxed degree of consistency across consistency domains that would be viable to clusters of 1,000's of nodes. In this paper, we describe the implementation of Cloud SQL Server with an emphasis on this core design principle.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["David G.
