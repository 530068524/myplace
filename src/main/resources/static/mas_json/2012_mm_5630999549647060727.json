In contrast to sense-making of paper documents, where physical structuring of many documents has proven to be key to effective work, interaction with video is still restricted to the traditional \"one video at a time\" paradigm. This paper investigates how interaction with video can benefit from paper-like displays that allow for working with multiple videos simultaneously in physical space. We present a corresponding approach and system called PaperVideo, including novel interaction concepts for both video and audio. These include spatial techniques for temporal navigation, arranging, grouping and linking of videos, as well as for managing video contents and simultaneous audio playback on multiple displays. An evaluation with users provides insights into how paper-based navigation with videos improves active video work.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Roman Lissermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lissermann:Roman", "Simon Olberding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olberding:Simon", "Benjamin Petry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petry:Benjamin", "Max M\u00fchlh\u00e4user.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=hlh=auml=user:Max", "J\u00fcrgen Steimle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steimle:J=uuml=rgen"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
