{"title": "Physical Loci: Leveraging Spatial, Object and Semantic Memory for Command Selection.", "fields": ["mnemonic", "semantic memory", "method of loci", "memorization", "locus"], "abstract": "Physical Loci, a technique based on an ancient memory technique, allows users to quickly learn a large command set by leveraging spatial, object and verbal/semantic memory to create a cognitive link between individual commands and nearby physical objects in a room (called loci). We first report on an experiment that showed that for learning 25 items Physical Loci outperformed a mid-air Marking Menu baseline. A long-term retention experiment with 48 items then showed that recall was nearly perfect one week later and, surprisingly, independent of whether the command/locus mapping was one's own choice or somebody else's. A final study suggested that recall performance is robust to alterations of the learned mapping, whether systematic or random.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "National University of Singapore", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Simon T.
