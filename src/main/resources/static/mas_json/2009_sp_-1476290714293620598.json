In this paper we discuss a new method that generates password structures in highest probability order. We first automatically create a probabilistic context-free grammar based upon a training set of previously disclosed passwords. This grammar then allows us to generate word-mangling rules, and from them, password guesses to be used in password cracking. We will also show that this approach seems to provide a more effective way to crack passwords as compared to traditional methods by testing our tools and techniques on real password sets. In one series of experiments, training on a set of disclosed passwords, our approach was able to crack 28% to 129% more passwords than John the Ripper, a publicly available standard password cracking program.", "citation": "Citations (310)", "departments": ["Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University"], "authors": ["Matt Weir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weir:Matt", "Sudhir Aggarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aggarwal:Sudhir", "Breno de Medeiros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medeiros:Breno_de", "Bill Glodek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glodek:Bill"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2009", "pages": 15}
