This generates a 1-parameter family of functions alternatively defined as convolutions with a progressively wider Gaussian kernel. We prove that the corresponding 1-parameter family of persistence diagrams have norms that go rapidly to zero as time goes to infinity. This result rationalizes experimental observations about scale-space. We hope this will lead to targeted improvements of related computer vision methods.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Vienna", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Chao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chao", "Herbert Edelsbrunner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edelsbrunner:Herbert"], "pages": 8}
