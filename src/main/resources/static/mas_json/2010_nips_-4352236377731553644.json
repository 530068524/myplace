The realizability assumption, however, rarely holds in practice. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the sample complexity of active learning in the non-realizable case under multi-view setting. We prove that, with unbounded Tsybakov noise, the sample complexity of multi-view active learning can be O(log 1/e), contrasting to single-view setting where the polynomial improvement is the best possible achievement. We also prove that in general multi-view setting the sample complexity of active learning with unbounded Tsybakov noise is O(1/e), where the order of 1/e is independent of the parameter in Tsybakov noise, contrasting to previous polynomial bounds where the order of 1/e is related to the parameter in Tsybakov noise.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0028:Wei", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
