The basic techniques for solving this task are similar to those used for speaker verification and identification. The hypothesis of this paper is that the techniques originally developed for speaker verification and identification are not sufficiently discriminative for speaker clustering. However, the processing chain for speaker clustering is quite large - there are many potential areas for improvement. The question is:  where  should improvements be made to improve the  final  result? To answer this question, this paper takes a biomimetic approach based on a study with human participants acting as an automatic speaker clustering system. Our findings are twofold: it is the stage of modeling that has the highest potential, and information with respect to the temporal succession of frames is crucially missing. Experimental results with our implementation of a speaker clustering system incorporating our findings and applying it on TIMIT data show the validity of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Marburg", "University of Marburg"], "authors": ["Thilo Stadelmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stadelmann:Thilo", "Bernd Freisleben.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freisleben:Bernd"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
