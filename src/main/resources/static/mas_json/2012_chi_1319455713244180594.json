{"title": "Vignette: interactive texture design and manipulation with freeform gestures for pen-and-ink illustration.", "fields": ["image stitching", "inkwell", "gesture", "vignette", "scratch"], "abstract": "Vignette is an interactive system that facilitates texture creation in pen-and-ink illustrations. Unlike existing systems, Vignette preserves illustrators' workflow and style: users draw a fraction of a texture and use gestures to automatically fill regions with the texture. We currently support both 1D and 2D synthesis with stitching. Our system also has interactive refinement and editing capabilities to provide a higher level texture control, which helps artists achieve their desired vision. A user study with professional artists shows that Vignette makes the process of illustration more enjoyable and that first time users can create rich textures from scratch within minutes.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "University of Tokyo", "National University of Singapore", "Singapore Management University"], "authors": ["Rubaiat Habib Kazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazi:Rubaiat_Habib", "Takeo Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Takeo", "Shengdong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shengdong", "Richard C.
