{"title": "Assistance: the work practices of human administrative assistants and their implications for it and organizations.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "competence", "computer science"], "abstract": "Assistance - work carried out by one entity in support of another - is a concept of long-standing interest, both as a type of human work common in organizations and as a model of how computational systems might interact with humans. Surprisingly, the perhaps most paradigmatic form of assistance - the work of administrative assistants or secretaries - has received almost no attention. This paper reports on a study of assistants, and their principals and managers, laying out a model of their work, the skills and competencies they need to function effectively, and reflects on implications for the design of systems and organizations.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Thomas Erickson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erickson:Thomas", "Catalina M.
