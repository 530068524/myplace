{"title": "A FACS valid 3D dynamic action unit database with applications to 3D dynamic morphable facial modeling.", "fields": ["mesh generation", "optical flow", "ground truth", "solid modeling", "active appearance model"], "abstract": "This paper presents the first dynamic 3D FACS data set for facial expression research, containing 10 subjects performing between 19 and 97 different AUs both individually and in combination. In total the corpus contains 519 AU sequences. The peak expression frame of each sequence has been manually FACS coded by certified FACS experts. This provides a ground truth for 3D FACS based AU recognition systems. In order to use this data, we describe the first framework for building dynamic 3D morphable models. This includes a novel Active Appearance Model (AAM) based 3D facial registration and mesh correspondence scheme. The approach overcomes limitations in existing methods that require facial markers or are prone to optical flow drift. We provide the first quantitative assessment of such 3D facial mesh registration techniques and show how our proposed method provides more reliable correspondence.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Bath", "Jacobs University Bremen", "University of Surrey"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Darren Cosker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosker:Darren", "Eva Krumhuber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krumhuber:Eva", "Adrian Hilton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hilton:Adrian"], "pages": 8}
