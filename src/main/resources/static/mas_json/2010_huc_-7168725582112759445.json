However, providing intelligibility is non-trivial and requires the developer to understand how to generate explanations from application decision models. Furthermore, users need different types of explanations and this complicates the implementation of intelligibility. We have developed the Intelligibility Toolkit that makes it easy for application developers to obtain eight types of explanations from the most popular decision models of context-aware applications. We describe its extensible architecture, and the explanation generation algorithms we developed. We validate the usefulness of the toolkit with three canonical applications that use the toolkit to generate explanations for end-users.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Brian Y.
