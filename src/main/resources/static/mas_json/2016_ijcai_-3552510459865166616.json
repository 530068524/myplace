{"title": "Automatic Construction and Evaluation of a Large Semantically Enriched Wikipedia.", "fields": ["hyperlink", "information retrieval", "natural language processing", "artificial intelligence", "entity linking"], "abstract": "The hyperlink structure of Wikipedia constitutes a key resource for many Natural Language Processing tasks and applications, as it provides several million semantic annotations of entities in context. Yet only a small fraction of mentions across the entire Wikipedia corpus is linked. In this paper we present the automatic construction and evaluation of a Semantically Enriched Wikipedia (SEW) in which the overall number of linked mentions has been more than tripled solely by exploiting the structure of Wikipedia itself and the wide-coverage sense inventory of BabelNet. As a result we obtain a sense-annotated corpus with more than 200 million annotations of over 4 million different concepts and named entities. We then show that our corpus leads to competitive results on multiple tasks, such as Entity Linking and Word Similarity.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Alessandro Raganato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raganato:Alessandro", "Claudio Delli Bovi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bovi:Claudio_Delli", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "pages": 7}
