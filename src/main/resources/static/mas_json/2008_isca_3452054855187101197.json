The result is a chip entirely dominated by ancilla generation circuits. To address this issue, we introduce optimized ancilla factories and analyze theirstructure and physical layout for ion trap technology. We introduce a new quantum computing architecture with highly concentrated data-only regions surrounded by shared ancilla factories. The results are a reduced dependence on costly teleportation, more efficient distribution of generated ancillae and more than five times speedup over previous proposals.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Nemanja Isailovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isailovic:Nemanja", "Mark Whitney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whitney:Mark", "Yatish Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Yatish", "John Kubiatowicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kubiatowicz:John"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
