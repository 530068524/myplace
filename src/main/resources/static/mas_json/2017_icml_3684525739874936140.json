We propose a straightforward technique to constrain discrete ordinal probability distributions to be unimodal via a combination of the Poisson probability mass function and the softmax nonlinearity. We evaluate this approach on two large ordinal image datasets and obtain promising results.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Christopher Beckham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beckham:Christopher", "Christopher J.
