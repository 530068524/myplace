Its applications, such as 3D streaming, have become more and more popular on mobile devices. However, most of these applications do not support real-time 3D interactions. Consequently, mobile users can only watch or browse 3D contents passively instead of actively interacting with 3D objects. In this paper, we propose a novel method that allows mobile users to change a model's shape and motions through interactions via mobile touch screen and obtain feedbacks in real-time. To accelerate computational speed and reduce communication load, we compute 3D deformations using a spectral representation. Moreover, a progressive deformation streaming technique is proposed to reduce the effect of interaction delay between the server and mobile clients. Our experimental results indicate that our method provides real-time interaction feedback, offering satisfactory user experiences.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Baltimore", "Tufts University", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Ziying Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Ziying", "Orkun Ozbek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ozbek:Orkun", "Xiaohu Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Xiaohu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
