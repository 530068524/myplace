In the original paper, in table 1, denominator and numerator were flipped in the recommendations on how response rates (view rate, participation rate, and completion rate) should be calculated. The view rate should be the ratio of unique survey visitors divided by unique site visitors. The participation rate should be the ratio of those who agreed to participate divided by unique first survey page visitors. The completion rate is the ratio of the number of people who finished the survey divided by those who agreed to participate. The corrections have been made in the table in both columns.
