{"title": "Large-Scale Taxonomy Mapping for Restructuring and Integrating Wikipedia.", "fields": ["taxonomy", "restructuring", "data mining", "wordnet", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "We present a knowledge-rich methodology for disambiguating Wikipedia categories with WordNet synsets and using this semantic information to restructure a taxonomy automatically generated from the Wikipedia system of categories. We evaluate against a manual gold standard and show that both category disambiguation and taxonomy restructuring perform with high accuracy. Besides, we assess these methods on automatically generated datasets and show that we are able to effectively enrich WordNet with a large number of instances from Wikipedia. Our approach produces an integrated resource, thus bringing together the fine-grained classification of instances in Wikipedia and a well-structured top-level taxonomy from WordNet.", "citation": "Citations (142)", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "authors": ["Simone Paolo Ponzetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponzetto:Simone_Paolo", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
