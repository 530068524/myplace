The framework provides tools to ingest, transcode, present, annotate and index different types of media such as images, videos, audio files and textual documents. The front-end is compliant with the latest HTML5 standards, while the back-end allows system administrators to create processing pipelines that can be adapted for different tasks and purposes.   The system has been developed in a modular way, aiming at creating loosely coupled components, letting developers to use it as a whole or to select only the parts that are needed to develop their own tools and systems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Florence", "University of Florence", "University of Florence", "University of Florence", "University of Florence"], "authors": ["Giuseppe Becchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Becchi:Giuseppe", "Marco Bertini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertini:Marco", "Lorenzo Cioni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cioni:Lorenzo", "Alberto Del Bimbo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bimbo:Alberto_Del", "Andrea Ferracani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferracani:Andrea", "Daniele Pezzatini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pezzatini:Daniele", "Mathias Lux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lux:Mathias"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
