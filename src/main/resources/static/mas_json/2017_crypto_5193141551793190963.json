{"title": "Indistinguishability Obfuscation from Trilinear Maps and Block-Wise Local PRGs.", "fields": ["obfuscation", "discrete mathematics", "computer science", "locality"], "abstract": "We consider the question of finding the lowest degree L for which L-linear maps suffice to obtain IO. The current state of the art (Lin, EUROCRYPT\u201916, CRYPTO \u201917; Lin and Vaikunthanathan, FOCS\u201916; Ananth and Sahai, EUROCRYPT \u201917) is that L-linear maps (under suitable security assumptions) suffice for IO, assuming the existence of pseudo-random generators (PRGs) with output locality L. However, these works cannot answer the question of whether \\(L < 5\\) suffices, as no polynomial-stretch PRG with locality lower than 5 exists.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Huijia Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Huijia", "Stefano Tessaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tessaro:Stefano"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 31}
