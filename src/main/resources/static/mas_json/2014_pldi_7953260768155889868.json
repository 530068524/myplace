Our method applies context-sensitivity only when and where doing so is likely to improve the precision that matters for resolving given queries. The idea is to use a pre-analysis to estimate the impact of context-sensitivity on the main analysis's precision, and to use this information to find out when and where the main analysis should turn on or off its context-sensitivity. We formalize this approach and prove that the analysis always benefits from the pre-analysis-guided context-sensitivity. We implemented this selective method for an existing industrial-strength interval analyzer for full C. The method reduced the number of (false) alarms by 24.4%, while increasing the analysis cost by 27.8% on average.   The use of the selective method is not limited to context-sensitivity. We demonstrate this generality by following the same principle and developing a selective relational analysis.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "University of Oxford", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Hakjoo Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Hakjoo", "Wonchan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wonchan", "Kihong Heo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heo:Kihong", "Hongseok Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Hongseok", "Kwangkeun Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Kwangkeun"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
