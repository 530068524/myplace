This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of BurnAR, a novel demonstration which enables users to experience the illusion of seeing their own hands burning, which we achieve by overlaying virtual flames and smoke on their hands. Surprisingly, some users reported an involuntary warming sensation of their hands. Based on these comments, we hypothesized that stimulation of multiple sensory modalities presented in this AR environment can induce an involuntary experience in an additional sensory pathway: observation of virtual flames resulting in a heat sensation. This cross-modal transfer, known as virtual synesthesia, is a temporary experience which affects some people who are not synesthetes and only lasts for a short time during the illusory experience. To verify our hypothesis, we conducted an exploratory study where participants experienced the BurnAR demonstration under controlled conditions.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "Graz University of Technology", "University of South Australia", "Fairlight"], "authors": ["Peter Weir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weir:Peter", "Christian Sandor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandor:Christian", "Matt Swoboda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swoboda:Matt", "Thanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen_0002:Thanh", "Ulrich Eck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eck:Ulrich", "Gerhard Reitmayr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reitmayr:Gerhard", "Arindam Dey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dey:Arindam"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
