{"title": "Indistinguishability Obfuscation from the Multilinear Subgroup Elimination Assumption.", "fields": ["obfuscation", "constructive", "exponential family", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "multilinear map"], "abstract": "We revisit the question of constructing secure general-purpose indistinguishability obfuscation, with a security reduction based on explicit computational assumptions over multilinear maps. Previous to our work, such reductions were only known to exist based on meta-assumptions and/or ad-hoc assumptions: In the original constructive work of Garg et al. (FOCS 2013), the underlying explicit computational assumption encapsulated an exponential family of assumptions for each pair of circuits to be obfuscated. In the more recent work of Pass et al. (Crypto 2014), the underlying assumption is a meta-assumption that also encapsulates an exponential family of assumptions, and this meta-assumption is invoked in a manner that captures the specific pair of circuits to be obfuscated. The assumptions underlying both these works substantially capture (either explicitly or implicitly) the actual structure of the obfuscation mechanism itself. In our work, we provide the first construction of general-purpose indistinguishability obfuscation proven secure via a reduction to a natural computational assumption over multilinear maps, namely, the Multilinear Subgroup Elimination Assumption. This assumption does not depend on the circuits to be obfuscated (except for its size), and does not correspond to the underlying structure of our obfuscator. The technical heart of our paper is our reduction, which gives a new way to argue about the security of indistinguishability obfuscation.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "departments": ["IBM", "Columbia University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Craig Gentry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentry:Craig", "Allison Bishop Lewko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lewko:Allison_Bishop", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit", "Brent Waters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waters:Brent"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
