We explore the possibility of achieving security under \\emph{continual} leakage from the \\emph{entire} secret key by designing schemes in which the secret key is updated over time. In this model, we construct public-key encryption schemes, digital signatures, and identity-based encryption schemes that remain secure even if an attacker can leak a constant fraction of the secret memory (including the secret key) in each time period between key updates. We also consider attackers who may probe the secret memory during the updates themselves. We stress that we allow unrestricted leakage, without the assumption that ``only computation leaks information''. Prior to this work, constructions of public-key encryption schemes secure under continual leakage were not known even under this assumption.", "citation": "Citations (209)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Microsoft", "University of Maryland, College Park", "IBM"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Zvika Brakerski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brakerski:Zvika", "Yael Tauman Kalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalai:Yael_Tauman", "Jonathan Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz:Jonathan", "Vinod Vaikuntanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaikuntanathan:Vinod"], "pages": 10}
