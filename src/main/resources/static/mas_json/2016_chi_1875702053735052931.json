Access to antenatal care (ANC) services presents a particular challenge. We conducted focus groups with 59 refugees in rural Lebanon to identify contextual and cultural factors that can inform the design of digital technologies to support refugee ANC. Previously identified high utilization of smartphones by the refugee population offers a particular opportunity for using digital technology to support access to ANC as well as health advocacy. Our findings revealed a number of considerations that should be taken into account in the design of refugee ANC technologies, including: refugee health beliefs and experiences, literacy levels, refugee perceptions of negative attitudes of healthcare providers, and hierarchal and familial structures.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "American University of Beirut", "Microsoft", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Konstantinos Kazakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazakos:Konstantinos", "Siddhartha Asthana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asthana:Siddhartha", "Madeline Balaam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balaam:Madeline", "Mona Duggal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duggal:Mona", "Amey Holden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holden:Amey", "Limalemla Jamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamir:Limalemla", "Nanda Kishore Kannuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kannuri:Nanda_Kishore", "Saurabh Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Saurabh", "Amarendar Reddy Manindla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manindla:Amarendar_Reddy", "Subhashini Arcot Manikam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manikam:Subhashini_Arcot", "G.
