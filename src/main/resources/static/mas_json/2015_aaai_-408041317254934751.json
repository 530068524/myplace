Recently, two new notions of backdoors to planning were introduced. However, for one of the new notions (i.e., variable-deletion) only hardness results are known so far. In this work we improve the situation by defining a new type of variable-deletion backdoors based on the extended causal graph of a planning instance. For this notion of backdoors several fixed-parameter tractable algorithms are identified. Furthermore, we explore the capabilities of polynomial time preprocessing, i.e., we check whether there exists a polynomial kernel. Our results also show the close connection between planning and verification problems such as Vector Addition System with States (VASS).", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Masaryk University", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Martin Kronegger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kronegger:Martin", "Sebastian Ordyniak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ordyniak:Sebastian", "Andreas Pfandler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfandler:Andreas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
