It may lead to inefficient use of the network resources by increasing congestion, as well as affect the network connectivity due to the non-cooperation behaviors of some selfish users. In this paper, we focus on promoting self-supported and congestion-aware networking for emergency services in WANETs based on the idea of Do-It-Yourself 1 . We model network congestion and non-cooperation behaviors according to the relations between nodes in the constructed dependency graph. Then we propose an energy-efficient and congestion-aware routing protocol for the emergency services of WANETs. Based on the proposed model and routing protocol, we design two novel movement schemes, called Direct Movement to potential selfish/busy Relays (DMR) scheme and Iterative Movement to potential selfish/busy Relays (IMR) scheme for urgent sources to support themselves and to avoid congestion and non-cooperation. Analysis and simulation results show that our approaches significantly achieve better network performance and typically satisfy the requirements for emergency services in WANETs.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Biao Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Biao", "Jie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0002:Jie", "Jinshu Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Jinshu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
