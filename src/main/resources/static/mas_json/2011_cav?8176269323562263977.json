Traditionally, stand-alone tools for these techniques have been developed for the numerical domains which may be sufficient for lower levels of program correctness. To analyze a wider range of programs, we have developed a tool to compute symbolic fixpoints for quantified bag domain. This domain is useful for programs that deal with collections of values. Our tool is able to derive both loop invariants and method pre/post conditions via fixpoint analysis of recursive bag constraints. To support better precision, we have allowed disjunctive formulae to be inferred, where appropriate. As a stand-alone tool, we have tested it on a range of small but challenging examples with acceptable precision and performance.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "Vietnam National University, Hanoi", "Vietnam National University, Hanoi", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Tuan-Hung Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Tuan=Hung", "Minh-Thai Trinh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trinh:Minh=Thai", "Anh-Hoang Truong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Truong:Anh=Hoang", "Wei-Ngan Chin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chin:Wei=Ngan"], "pages": 7}
