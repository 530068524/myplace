{"title": "Cybertron: pushing the limit on I/O reduction in data-parallel programs.", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "static program analysis", "input output", "computation", "granularity"], "abstract": "I/O reduction has been a major focus in optimizing data-parallel programs for big-data processing. While the current state-of-the-art techniques use static program analysis to reduce I/O, Cybertron proposes a new direction that incorporates runtime mechanisms to push the limit further on I/O reduction. In particular, Cybertron tracks how data is used in the computation accurately at runtime to filter unused data at finer granularity dynamically, beyond what current static-analysis based mechanisms are capable of, and to facilitate a new mechanism called  constraint based encoding  for more efficient encoding. Cybertron has been implemented and applied to production data-parallel programs; our extensive evaluations on real programs and real data have shown its effectiveness on I/O reduction over the existing mechanisms at reasonable CPU cost, and its improvement on end-to-end performance in various network environments.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Tian Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Tian", "Zhenyu Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Zhenyu", "Hucheng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Hucheng", "Jiaxing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jiaxing", "Xu Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xu", "Chencheng Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Chencheng", "Xi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xi", "Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Wei", "Wenguang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wenguang", "Lidong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Lidong"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2014", "pages": 14}
