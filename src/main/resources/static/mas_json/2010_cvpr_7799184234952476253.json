{"title": "Improving web image search results using query-relative classifiers.", "fields": ["phrase search", "web query classification", "search analytics", "web search query", "semantic search"], "abstract": "Web image search using text queries has received considerable attention. However, current state-of-the-art approaches require training models for every new query, and are therefore unsuitable for real-world web search applications. The key contribution of this paper is to introduce generic classifiers that are based on query-relative features which can be used for new queries without additional training. They combine textual features, based on the occurence of query terms in web pages and image meta-data, and visual histogram representations of images. The second contribution of the paper is a new database for the evaluation of web image search algorithms. It includes 71478 images returned by a web search engine for 353 different search queries, along with their meta-data and ground-truth annotations. Using this data set, we compared the image ranking performance of our model with that of the search engine, and with an approach that learns a separate classifier for each query. Our generic models that use query-relative features improve significantly over the raw search engine ranking, and also outperform the query-specific models.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Caen Lower Normandy", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Caen Lower Normandy"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Josip Krapac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krapac:Josip", "Moray Allan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allan:Moray", "Jakob J.
