We are implementing a suicide risk detection system, in collaboration with the VA, that would serve as a surveillance system for risk factors appearing in clinical text data. Primary requirements for this system are fast search capability, feature and information extraction, and delivery of data to up-stream natural language processing models. As such, we are evaluating scalable storage solutions on the basis of performance, fault tolerance, and scalability. In this paper we present our current approach to evaluation, preliminary findings, and the work in progress towards a more robust text analysis pipeline.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": [], "conf": "icde", "authors": ["Benjamin Mayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayer:Benjamin", "Joshua Arnold.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arnold:Joshua", "Edmon Begoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Begoli:Edmon", "Everett Rush.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rush:Everett", "Michael Drewry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drewry:Michael", "Kris Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brown:Kris", "Eduardo Ponce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponce:Eduardo", "Sudarshan Srinivas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivas:Sudarshan"], "pages": 9}
