{"title": "Constructing Symbolic Representations for High-Level Planning.", "fields": ["symbol", "machine learning", "planning domain definition language", "artificial intelligence", "reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of constructing a symbolic description of a continuous, low-level environment for use in planning. We show that symbols that can represent the preconditions and effects of an agent's actions are both necessary and sufficient for high-level planning. This eliminates the symbol design problem when a representation must be constructed in advance, and in principle enables an agent to autonomously learn its own symbolic representations. The resulting representation can be converted into PDDL, a canonical high-level planning representation that enables very fast planning.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George", "Leslie Pack Kaelbling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaelbling:Leslie_Pack", "Tom\u00e1s Lozano-P\u00e9rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lozano=P=eacute=rez:Tom=aacute=s"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
