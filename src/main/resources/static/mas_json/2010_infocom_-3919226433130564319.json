{"title": "On the Impact of Random Losses on TCP Performance in Coded Wireless Mesh Networks.", "fields": ["order one network protocol", "wireless mesh network", "switched mesh", "shared mesh", "zeta tcp"], "abstract": "Network coding (NC) is a promising technique to improve throughput in wireless mesh networks. However, some previous studies have found that the actual performance improvements offered by NC may be much lower than the gains predicted by theory. This is especially so when the bulk of the traffic carried by the mesh network is composed of TCP flows. By means of both mathematical modeling and ns-2 simulations, we explore some issues due to random packet loss in coded mesh networks. Our results illustrate how the use of network coding may induce synchronization between TCP flows; they also suggest that, under particular conditions of random packet loss, the aggregate throughput may actually be lower when NC is used.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne", "\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne", "\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne"], "authors": ["Sofiane Hassayoun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassayoun:Sofiane", "Patrick Maill\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maill=eacute=:Patrick", "David Ros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ros:David"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
