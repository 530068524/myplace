{"title": "Scalable GPU graph traversal.", "fields": ["strength of a graph", "graph bandwidth", "distance hereditary graph", "folded cube graph", "factor critical graph"], "abstract": "Breadth-first search (BFS) is a core primitive for graph traversal and a basis for many higher-level graph analysis algorithms. It is also representative of a class of parallel computations whose memory accesses and work distribution are both irregular and data-dependent. Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of GPU sparse graph traversal, but has tended to focus on asymptotically inefficient algorithms that perform poorly on graphs with non-trivial diameter.   We present a BFS parallelization focused on fine-grained task management constructed from efficient prefix sum that achieves an asymptotically optimal  O (| V |+| E |) work complexity. Our implementation delivers excellent performance on diverse graphs, achieving traversal rates in excess of 3.3 billion and 8.3 billion traversed edges per second using single and quad-GPU configurations, respectively. This level of performance is several times faster than state-of-the-art implementations both CPU and GPU platforms.", "citation": "Citations (423)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Nvidia", "University of Virginia", "Unversity of Vi ... sville, VA, USA"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Duane Merrill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Merrill:Duane", "Michael Garland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garland:Michael", "Andrew S.
