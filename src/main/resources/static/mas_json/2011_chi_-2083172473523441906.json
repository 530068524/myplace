By measuring the length of participants' comments on a news website, the time taken to write them, and the number of issue-relevant thoughts they contain, we demonstrate that participants conform to high vs. low norms of thoughtfulness manifested through either the apparent behavior of other users or through visual, textual and interactional design features conceptually associated with thoughtfulness. Theoretical and applied insights for designing online participatory environments are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Abhay Sukumaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sukumaran:Abhay", "Stephanie Vezich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vezich:Stephanie", "Melanie McHugh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McHugh:Melanie", "Clifford Nass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nass:Clifford"], "pages": 10}
