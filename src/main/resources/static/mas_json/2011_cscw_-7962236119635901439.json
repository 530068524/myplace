In this paper we identify two main barriers to research in this area - the lack of a common taxonomy and the scarceness of large, real-world, annotated data. To address these issues we present a taxonomy of urban sounds and a new dataset, UrbanSound, containing 27 hours of audio with 18.5 hours of annotated sound event occurrences across 10 sound classes. The challenges presented by the new dataset are studied through a series of experiments using a baseline classification system.", "citation": "Citations (200)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Lugano", "University of Oulu", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Queensland University of Technology", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Cambridge", "Yahoo!", "University of Turin", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Walkonomics, Lo ...
