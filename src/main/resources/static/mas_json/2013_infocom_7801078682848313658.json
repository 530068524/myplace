{"title": "WheelLoc: Enabling continuous location service on mobile phone for outdoor scenarios.", "fields": ["response time", "provisioning", "telecommunications service", "point location", "indirect approach"], "abstract": "The proliferation of location-based services and applications calls for provisioning of location service as a first class system component that can return accurate location fix in short response time and is energy efficient. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of WheelLoc - a continuous system location service for outdoor scenarios. Unlike previous localization efforts that try to directly obtain a point location fix, WheelLoc adopts an indirect approach: it seeks to capture a user mobility trace first and to obtain any point location by time- and speed-aware interpolation or extrapolation. WheelLoc avoids energy-expensive sensors completely and relies solely on commonly available cheap sensors such as accelerometer and magnetometer. With a set of novel techniques and the leverage of publicly available road maps and cell tower information, WheelLoc is able to meet those requirements of a first class component. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of WheelLoc. It can return a location estimate within 40ms with an accuracy about 40 meters, consumes only 240mW energy, and effectively strikes a better energy-accuracy tradeoff than GPS duty-cycling.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Duke University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["He Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:He", "Zhiyang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhiyang", "Guobin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Guobin", "Fan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fan", "Song Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Song", "Feng Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Feng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
