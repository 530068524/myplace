We test to which extent two prevalent viewpoints hold. That is, popular users (those with many social contacts) are the ones whose personality traits  either  predict many offline (real world) friends  or  predict propensity to maintain superficial relationships. We find that the predictor for number of friends in the real world (Extraversion) is also a predictor for number of Facebook contacts. We then test whether people who have many social contacts on Facebook are the ones who are able to adapt themselves to new forms of communication, present themselves in likable ways, and have propensity to maintain superficial relationships. We show that there is no statistical evidence to support such a conjecture.", "citation": "Citations (169)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Imperial College London", "University of Nottingham", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Daniele Quercia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quercia:Daniele", "Renaud Lambiotte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lambiotte:Renaud", "David Stillwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stillwell:David", "Michal Kosinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosinski:Michal", "Jon Crowcroft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crowcroft:Jon"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
