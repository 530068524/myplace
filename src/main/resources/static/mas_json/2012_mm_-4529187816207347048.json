Users' points of gaze are measured with an eye tracker while they are viewing or tagging images. By means of the gaze data, image selections will be created automatically and tags will be assigned to specific image regions. So far, we have shown that one can assign given tags to regions in a manually segmented image.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Koblenz and Landau"], "authors": ["Tina Walber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walber:Tina"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
