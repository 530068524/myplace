{"title": "An Explicit Sampling Dependent Spectral Error Bound for Column Subset Selection.", "fields": ["matrix norm", "slice sampling", "randomized algorithm", "sampling distribution", "constrained optimization"], "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of column subset selection. We present a novel analysis of the spectral norm reconstruction for a simple randomized algorithm and establish a new bound that depends explicitly on the sampling probabilities. The sampling dependent error bound (i) allows us to better understand the tradeoff in the reconstruction error due to sampling probabilities, (ii) exhibits more insights than existing error bounds that exploit specific probability distributions, and (iii) implies better sampling distributions. In particular, we show that a sampling distribution with probabilities proportional to the square root of the statistical leverage scores is better than uniform sampling, and is better than leverage-based sampling when the statistical leverage scores are very nonuniform. And by solving a constrained optimization problem related to the error bound with an efficient bisection search we are able to achieve better performance than using either the leverage-based distribution or that proportional to the square root of the statistical leverage scores. Numerical simulations demonstrate the benefits of the new sampling distributions for low-rank matrix approximation and least square approximation compared to state-of-the art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Iowa", "Nanjing University", "Alibaba Group", "Michigan State University", "Alibaba Group"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Tianbao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Tianbao", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Lijun", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Shenghuo Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Shenghuo"], "pages": 9}
