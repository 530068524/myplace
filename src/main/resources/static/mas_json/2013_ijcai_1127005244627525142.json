{"title": "Sound, Complete, and Minimal Query Rewriting for Existential Rules.", "fields": ["confluence", "backward chaining", "datalog", "unification", "conjunctive query"], "abstract": "We address the issue of Ontology-Based Data Access which consists of exploiting the semantics expressed in ontologies while querying data. Ontologies are represented in the framework of existential rules, also known as Datalog+/-. We focus on the backward chaining paradigm, which involves rewriting the query (assumed to be a conjunctive query, CQ) into a set of CQs (seen as a union of CQs). The proposed algorithm accepts any set of existential rules as input and stops for so-called finite unification sets of rules (fus). The rewriting step relies on a graph notion, called a piece, which allows to identify subsets of atoms from the query that must be processed together. We first show that our rewriting method computes a minimal set of CQs when this set is finite, i.e., the set of rules is a fus. We then focus on optimizing the rewriting step. First experiments are reported in the associated technical report.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Montpellier", "University of Montpellier", "Dresden University of Technology", "Laboratoire d'I ...  de Montpellier"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["M\u00e9lanie K\u00f6nig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=nig:M=eacute=lanie", "Michel Lecl\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lecl=egrave=re:Michel", "Marie-Laure Mugnier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mugnier:Marie=Laure", "Micha\u00ebl Thomazo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomazo:Micha=euml=l"], "pages": 5}
