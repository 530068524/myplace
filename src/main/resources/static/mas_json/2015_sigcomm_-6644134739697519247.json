{"title": "A Declarative and Expressive Approach to Control Forwarding Paths in Carrier-Grade Networks.", "fields": ["multiprotocol label switching", "openflow", "carrier grade", "scalability", "network management"], "abstract": "SDN simplifies network management by relying on declarativity (high-level interface) and expressiveness (network flexibility). We propose a solution to support those features while preserving high robustness and scalability as needed in carrier-grade networks. Our solution is based on (i) a two-layer architecture separating connectivity and optimization tasks; and (ii) a centralized optimizer called framework, which translates high-level goals expressed almost in natural language into compliant network configurations. Our evaluation on real and synthetic topologies shows that framework improves the state of the art by (i) achieving better trade-offs for classic goals covered by previous works, (ii) supporting a larger set of goals (refined traffic engineering and service chaining), and (iii) optimizing large ISP networks in few seconds. We also quantify the gains of our implementation, running Segment Routing on top of IS-IS, over possible alternatives (RSVP-TE and OpenFlow).", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Cisco Systems, Inc."], "authors": ["Renaud Hartert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartert:Renaud", "Stefano Vissicchio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vissicchio:Stefano", "Pierre Schaus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaus:Pierre", "Olivier Bonaventure.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonaventure:Olivier", "Clarence Filsfils.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filsfils:Clarence", "Thomas Telkamp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Telkamp:Thomas", "Pierre Fran\u00e7ois.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fran=ccedil=ois:Pierre"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2015", "pages": 14}
