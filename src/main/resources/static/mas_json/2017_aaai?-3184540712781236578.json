{"title": "Leveraging Video Descriptions to Learn Video Question Answering.", "fields": ["baseline", "scalability", "machine learning", "computer science", "natural language processing", "question answering", "artificial intelligence", "natural language"], "abstract": "We propose a scalable approach to learn video-based question answering (QA): answer a \"free-form natural language question\" about a video content. Our approach automatically harvests a large number of videos and descriptions freely available online. Then, a large number of candidate QA pairs are automatically generated from descriptions rather than manually annotated. Next, we use these candidate QA pairs to train a number of video-based QA methods extended fromMN (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015), VQA (Antol et al. 2015), SA (Yao et al. 2015), SS (Venugopalan et al. 2015). In order to handle non-perfect candidate QA pairs, we propose a self-paced learning procedure to iteratively identify them and mitigate their effects in training. Finally, we evaluate performance on manually generated video-based QA pairs. The results show that our self-paced learning procedure is effective, and the extended SS model outperforms various baselines.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Kuo-Hao Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Kuo=Hao", "Tseng-Hung Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Tseng=Hung", "Ching-Yao Chuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuang:Ching=Yao", "Yuan-Hong Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Yuan=Hong", "Juan Carlos Niebles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niebles:Juan_Carlos", "Min Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Min"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
