This approach, however, has several restrictions. In particular, partitioned databases are inflexible in large-scale deployments and assume a partition-friendly workload in order to scale. In this paper, we analyze an alternative architecture design for distributed relational databases that overcomes the limitations of partitioned databases. The architecture is based on two fundamental principles: We decouple query processing and transaction management from data storage, and we share data across query processing nodes. The combination of these design choices provides scalability, elasticity, and operational flexibility without making any assumptions on the workload. As a drawback, sharing data among multiple database nodes causes synchronization overhead. To address this limitation, we introduce techniques for scalable transaction processing in shared-data environments. Specifically, we describe mechanisms for efficient data access, concurrency control, and data buffering. In combination with new hardware trends, the techniques enable performance characteristics that top state-of-the-art partitioned databases.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Simon Loesing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loesing:Simon", "Markus Pilman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilman:Markus", "Thomas Etter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etter:Thomas", "Donald Kossmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kossmann:Donald"], "pages": 14}
