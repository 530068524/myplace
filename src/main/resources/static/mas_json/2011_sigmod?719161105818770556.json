BRRL is optimized for cloud applications with frequent points of consistency that use data-parallelism to avoid complex concurrency control mechanisms. BRRL differs from existing recovery libraries by providing a simple table abstraction and using schema information to optimize checkpointing. We will demonstrate the utility of BRRL using a distributed transaction processing system and a platform for scientific behavioral simulations.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Tuan Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Tuan", "Benjamin Sowell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sowell:Benjamin", "Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salles:Marcos_Antonio_Vaz", "Alan J.
