Many LBS providers use users' location information to offer them convenience and useful functions. However, the LBS could greatly breach personal privacy because location itself contains much information. Hence, preserving location privacy while achieving utility from it is still an challenging question now. This paper tackles this non-trivial challenge by designing a suite of novel fine-grained Privacy-preserving Location Query Protocol (PLQP). Our protocol allows different levels of location query on encrypted location information for different users, and it is efficient enough to be applied in mobile platforms.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Taeho Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Taeho"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
