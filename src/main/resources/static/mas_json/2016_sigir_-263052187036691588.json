Previous attempts at the problem have been formulated as variations on the coherence and/or mutual information of top words in a topic. In this work, we propose several new metrics for evaluating topic quality with the help of distributed word representations; our experiments suggest that the new metrics are a better match for human judgement, which is the gold standard in this case, than previously developed approaches.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics"], "authors": ["Sergey I.
