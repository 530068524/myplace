Designing future storage systems requires comprehensive insights that existing trace analysis methods are ill-equipped to supply. In this paper, we seek to provide such insights by using a new methodology that leverages an objective, multi-dimensional statistical technique to extract data access patterns from network storage system traces. We apply our method on two large-scale real-world production network storage system traces to obtain comprehensive access patterns and design insights at user, application, file, and directory levels. We derive simple, easily implementable, threshold-based design optimizations that enable efficient data placement and capacity optimization strategies for servers, consolidation policies for clients, and improved caching performance for both.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "NetApp", "NetApp", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Yanpei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yanpei", "Kiran Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Kiran", "Garth R.
