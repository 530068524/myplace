In this paper, we tackle the following problems: (i) is it possible to construct optical queues with switches of arbitrary sizes? (ii) is there a general theory that unifies many constructions of optical queues with known packet delays? and (iii) under what conditions can a concatenation of optical queues allow overtaking? For the first problem, we propose a new class of optical memory cells that can be made by switches of arbitrary sizes. Moreover, we propose the generalized C -transform for routing packets through such optical memory cells. For the second problem, we introduce a new class of optical queues, including FIFO, LIFO and absolute contractors. We show that both linear compressors in [13] and FIFO multiplexers (with multiple inputs) in [5], [7] are special cases of contractors. An interesting finding is that overtaking can occur in LIFO and absolute contractors.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University"], "authors": ["Cheng-Shang Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Cheng=Shang", "Jay Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Jay", "Duan-Shin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Duan=Shin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
