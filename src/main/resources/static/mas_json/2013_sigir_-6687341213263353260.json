Termhood is one essential measure for judging whether a phrase is a term. Previous researches on termhood mainly depend on the word frequency information. In this paper, we propose to compute termhood based on semantic representation of words. A novel topic model, namely i-SWB, is developed to map the domain corpus into a latent semantic space, which is composed of some general topics, a background topic and a documents-specific topic. Experiments on four domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ATE approaches.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Sujian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Sujian", "Jiwei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiwei", "Tao Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Tao", "Wenjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenjie", "Baobao Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Baobao"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
