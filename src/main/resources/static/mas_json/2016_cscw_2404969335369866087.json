{"title": "Automatic Archiving versus Default Deletion: What Snapchat Tells Us About Ephemerality in Design.", "fields": ["default", "ephemeral key", "social media", "dance", "ephemerality"], "abstract": "Unlike most social media, where automatic archiving of data is the default, Snapchat defaults to ephemerality: deleting content shortly after it is viewed by a receiver. Interviews with 25 Snapchat users show that ephemerality plays a key role in shaping their practices. Along with friend-adding features that facilitate a network of mostly close relations, default deletion affords everyday, mundane talk and reduces self-consciousness while encouraging playful interaction. Further, although receivers can save content through screenshots, senders are notified; this selective saving with notification supports complex information norms that preserve the feel of ephemeral communication while supporting the capture of meaningful content. This dance of giving and taking, sharing and showing, and agency for both senders and receivers provides the basis for a rich design space of mechanisms, levels, and domains for ephemerality.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Bin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0002:Bin", "Pamara F.
