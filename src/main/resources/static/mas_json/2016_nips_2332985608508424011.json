We suggest a new estimator that is computationally efficient and requires a number of samples that is near-optimal with respect to previously established information theoretic lower-bound. Our statistical estimator has a physical interpretation in terms of \"interaction screening\". The estimator is consistent and is efficiently implemented using convex optimization. We prove that with appropriate regularization, the estimator recovers the underlying graph using a number of samples that is logarithmic in the system size p and exponential in the maximum coupling-intensity and maximum node-degree.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Los Alamos National Laboratory", "California Institute of Technology", "University of Paris-Sud", "Los Alamos National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Marc Vuffray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vuffray:Marc", "Sidhant Misra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Misra:Sidhant", "Andrey Y.
