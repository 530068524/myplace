To guarantee consistency even in the case of power failures, programmers need to ensure that data is flushed from volatile CPU caches where it would be susceptible to power outages to NVRAM.   In this paper, we present the NVC-Hashmap, a lock-free hashmap that is used for unordered dictionaries and delta indices in in-memory databases. The NVC-Hashmap is then evaluated in both stand-alone and integrated database benchmarks and compared to a B+-Tree based persistent data structure.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "authors": ["David Schwalb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwalb:David", "Markus Dreseler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dreseler:Markus", "Matthias Uflacker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uflacker:Matthias", "Hasso Plattner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plattner:Hasso"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
