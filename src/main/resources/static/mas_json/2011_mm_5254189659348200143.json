Visual content of images and tags have both been investigated. However, existing methods usually employ tags and visual content separately or sequentially to learn the image relevance. This paper proposes a tag-based image search with visual-text joint hypergraph learning. We simultaneously investigate the bag-of-words and bag-of-visual-words representations of images and accomplish the relevance estimation with a hypergraph learning approach. Each textual or visual word generates a hyperedge in the constructed hypergraph. We conduct experiments with a real-world data set and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Singapore Management University", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yue Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yue", "Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Meng", "Huan-Bo Luan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luan:Huan=Bo", "Jialie Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Jialie", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng", "Dacheng Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Dacheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
