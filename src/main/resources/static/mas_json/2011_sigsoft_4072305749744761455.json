{"title": "Inferring test results for dynamic software product lines.", "fields": ["orthogonal array testing", "software reliability testing", "non regression testing", "stress testing", "system integration testing"], "abstract": "Due to the very large number of configurations that can typically be derived from a Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL), efficient and effective testing of such systems have become a major challenge for software developers. In particular, when a configuration needs to be deployed quickly due to rapid contextual changes (e.g., in an unfolding crisis), time constraints hinder the proper testing of such a configuration. In this paper, we propose to reduce the testing required of such DSPLs to a relevant subset of configurations. Whenever a need to adapt to an untested configuration is encountered, our approach determines the most similar tested configuration and reuses its test results to either obtain a coverage measure or infer a confidence degree for the new, untested configuration. We focus on providing these techniques for inference of structural testing results for DSPLs, which is supported by an early prototype implementation.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "University of East Anglia", "Federal University of S\u00e3o Carlos", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["Bruno Barbieri Pontes Cafeo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cafeo:Bruno_Barbieri_Pontes", "Joost Noppen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noppen:Joost", "Fabiano Cutigi Ferrari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferrari:Fabiano_Cutigi", "Ruzanna Chitchyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chitchyan:Ruzanna", "Awais Rashid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rashid:Awais"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
