However, the monitoring systems deployed in telecom operators are usually too slow because of their disk-based processing approach. To address this problem, an online network traffic monitoring system, named SMART, is designed and developed. The system converts different formats of raw Netflow data (Netflow IPv5, IPv7 and IPv9) to user-defined control flows through combination and filtering. It can compute top-k frequent flows with sliding window, detects burst on arbitrary attributes, and presents results visually to users. The system could be used to replace the traditional offline monitoring system used in Shanghai Telecom. In its daily operation, it is shown that the processing speed achieves 30,000 flows per second. The basis of advanced streaming algorithms and design of robust system architecture enable SMART to achieve good performance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "East China Normal University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Shanghai Teleco ... i 200120,China)"], "authors": ["Aoying Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Aoying", "Ying Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Ying", "Xueqing Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Xueqing", "Jianlong Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Jianlong", "Dai Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Dai"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
