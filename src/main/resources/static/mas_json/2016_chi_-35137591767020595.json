The same issue could evoke concern or not in the span of an interview, sometimes even a single sentence. Drawing on dual-process theories from psychology, we argue that some of the apparent contradictions can be resolved if privacy concern is divided into two components we call intuitive concern, a \"gut feeling,\" and considered concern, produced by a weighing of risks and benefits. Consistent with previous explanations of the so-called privacy paradox, we argue that people may express high considered concern when prompted, but in practice act on low intuitive concern without a considered assessment. We also suggest a new explanation: a considered assessment can override an intuitive assessment of high concern without eliminating it. Here, people may choose rationally to accept a privacy risk but still express intuitive concern when prompted.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chanda Phelan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phelan:Chanda", "Cliff Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Cliff", "Paul Resnick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Resnick:Paul"], "pages": 12}
