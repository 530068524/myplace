In particular, we will demonstrate new mechanisms and intuitive user interfaces designed to allow users to query work flows by example and to refine work flows by analogies. These techniques are implemented in VisTrails, an open-source provenance-enabled scientific work flow system that can be combined with a wide range of tools, libraries, and visualization systems. We will show di erent scenarios where these techniques can be used to simplify the notoriously hard tasks of creating and refining work flows.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Carlos Eduardo Scheidegger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheidegger:Carlos_Eduardo", "Huy T.
