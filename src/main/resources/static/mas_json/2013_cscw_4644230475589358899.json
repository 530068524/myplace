OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a successful example of ubiquitous crowd-sourcing, where citizens volunteer geographic information in order to build and maintain an accurate map of the changing world. Research has shown that OSM information is  accurate , by comparing it with centrally maintained spatial information such as Ordnance Survey. However, we find that coverage is low and non uniformly distributed, thus challenging the suitability of ubiquitous crowd-sourcing as a mechanism to map the whole world. In this paper, we investigate what contextual factors correlate with  coverage  of OSM information in urban settings. We find that, although there is a direct correlation between population density and information coverage, other socio-economic factors also play an important role. We discuss the implications of these findings with respect to the design of urban crowd-sourcing applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Afra J.
