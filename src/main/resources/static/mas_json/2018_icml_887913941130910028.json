Such models provide a way to efficiently sample from the Gibbs distribution and facilitate predictions that are robust to random noise. In this paper, we propose a provably polynomial time randomized algorithm for learning the parameters of perturbed MAP predictors. Our approach is based on minimizing a novel Rademacher-based generalization bound on the expected loss of a perturbed MAP predictor, which can be computed in polynomial time. We obtain conditions under which our randomized learning algorithm can guarantee generalization to unseen examples.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Asish Ghoshal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghoshal:Asish", "Jean Honorio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Honorio:Jean"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
