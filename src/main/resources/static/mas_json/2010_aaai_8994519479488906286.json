In this paper, we extend an existing HTN planner with a new state projection algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first HTN planner that can reason about nonlinear continuous effects. We use a wait action to instruct this planner to consider continuous effects in a given state. We also introduce a new planning domain to demonstrate the benefits of planning with nonlinear continuous effects. We compare our approach with a linear continuous effects planner and a discrete effects HTN planner on a benchmark domain, which reveals that its additional costs are largely mitigated by domain knowledge. Finally, we present an initial application of this algorithm in a practical domain, a Navy training simulation, illustrating the utility of this approach for planning in dynamic continuous environments.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "Knexus Research ... pringfield, VA"], "authors": ["Matthew Molineaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Molineaux:Matthew", "Matthew Klenk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klenk:Matthew", "David W.
