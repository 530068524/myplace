Recently they have also been applied to probabilistic inference to estimate properties of high-dimensional distributions; however, they all rely on the same class of projections based on universal hashing. We provide a general framework to analyze random projections which relates their statistical properties to their Fourier spectrum, which is a well-studied area of theoretical computer science. Using this framework we introduce two new classes of hash functions for probabilistic inference and model counting that show promising performance on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Allen Institute ... e, Seattle, WA"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Tudor Achim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achim:Tudor", "Ashish Sabharwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabharwal:Ashish", "Stefano Ermon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ermon:Stefano"], "pages": 9}
