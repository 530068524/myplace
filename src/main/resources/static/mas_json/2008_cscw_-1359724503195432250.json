To address this issue, we developed EatWell, a system that allows people to use their cell phones to create voice memories describing how they have tried to eat healthfully in their neighborhoods ( e.g. , at local restaurants) and listen to the memories that others have created. In this paper, we describe the results of our field trial of EatWell, specifically characterizing how our participants were able to craft stories that were both emotive and culturally-relevant, the challenges that arose in creating these memories and finally how sharing these stories facilitated a sense of community empowerment. We conclude by presenting implications for the design of future applications that facilitate the sharing of health-related experiences.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Andrea Grimes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grimes:Andrea", "Martin Bednar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bednar:Martin", "Jay David Bolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bolter:Jay_David", "Rebecca E.
