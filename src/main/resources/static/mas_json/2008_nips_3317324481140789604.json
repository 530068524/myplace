We propose a new methodology for representing uncertainty in continuous-state control problems. Our approach, multi-resolution exploration (MRE), uses a hierarchical mapping to identify regions of the state space that would benefit from additional samples. We demonstrate MRE's broad utility by using it to speed up learning in a prototypical model-based and value-based reinforcement-learning method. Empirical results show that MRE improves upon state-of-the-art exploration approaches.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ali Nouri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nouri:Ali", "Michael L.
