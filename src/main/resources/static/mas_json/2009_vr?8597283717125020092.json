We present an augmented reality x-ray vision system that employs multiple view modes to support new visualizations that provide depth cues and spatial awareness to users. The edge overlay visualization provides depth cues to make hidden objects appear to be behind walls, rather than floating in front of them. Utilizing this edge overlay, the tunnel cut-out visualization provides details about occluding layers between the user and remote location. Inherent limitations of these visualizations are addressed by our addition of view modes allowing the user to obtain additional detail by zooming in, or an overview of the environment via an overhead exocentric view.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "departments": ["University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia"], "authors": ["Ben Avery.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avery:Ben", "Christian Sandor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandor:Christian", "Bruce H.
