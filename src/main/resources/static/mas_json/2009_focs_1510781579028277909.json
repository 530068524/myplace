{"title": "A New Probability Inequality Using Typical Moments and Concentration Results.", "fields": ["random projection", "uniform distribution", "bin packing problem", "log sum inequality", "second moment method"], "abstract": "We present two probability inequalities. The simpler first inequality weakens both hypotheses in Hoffding-Azumaine quality. Using it, we generalize concentration results previously known for the uniform density for the TSP, MWST and Random Projections to long-tailed inhomogeneous distributions. The second more complicated inequality further weakens the moment requirements and using it, we prove the best possible concentration for the long-studied bin packing problem as well as some others.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "authors": ["Ravindran Kannan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kannan:Ravindran"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
