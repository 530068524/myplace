{"title": "S2JSD-LSH: A Locality-Sensitive Hashing Schema for Probability Distributions.", "fields": ["locality sensitive hashing", "dynamic perfect hashing", "k independent hashing", "universal hashing", "schema"], "abstract": "To compare the similarity of probability distributions, the information-theoretically motivated metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) and Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) are often more reasonable compared with metrics for vectors like Euclidean and angular distance. However, existing locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithms cannot support the information-theoretically motivated metrics for probability distributions. In this paper, we first introduce a new approximation formula for S2JSD-distance, and then propose a novel LSH scheme adapted to S2JSD-distance for approximate nearest neighbors search in high-dimensional probability distributions. We define the specific hashing functions, and prove their local-sensitivity. Furthermore, extensive empirical evaluations well illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed hashing schema on six public image datasets and two text datasets, in terms of mean Average Precision, Precision@N and Precision-Recall curve.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "National University of Singapore", "Beijing Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Xianling Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Xianling", "Bo-Si Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Bo=Si", "Yi-Jing Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Yi=Jing", "Liqiang Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Liqiang", "Heyan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heyan", "Guihua Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Guihua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
