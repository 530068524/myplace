A 4-D Open-Curve Active Contour (Snake) model is proposed for simultaneous 3-D centerline tracing and local radius estimation. An image energy term, stretching term, and a novel region-based radial energy term constitute the energy to be minimized. This combination of energy terms allows the 4-D open-curve snake model, starting from an automatically detected seed point, to stretch along and fit the tubular structures like neurites and blood vessels. A graph-based curve completion approach is proposed to merge possible fragments caused by discontinuities in the tree structures. After tree structure extraction, the centerlines serve as the starting points for a Fast Marching segmentation for which the stopping time is automatically chosen. We illustrate the performance of our method with various datasets.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "University of Houston"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0032:Yu", "Arunachalam Narayanaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanaswamy:Arunachalam", "Badrinath Roysam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roysam:Badrinath"], "pages": 8}
