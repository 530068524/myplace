However, how to effectively fuse multiple features remains a challenging problem in visual tracking, especially in a data-driven manner. In this paper, we propose a new data-adaptive visual tracking approach by using multiple feature fusion via weighted entropy. Unlike existing visual trackers which simply concatenate multiple feature vectors together for object representation, we employ the weighted entropy to evaluate the dissimilarity between the object state and the background state, and seek the optimal feature combination by minimizing the weighted entropy, so that more complementary information can be exploited for object representation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in tackling various challenges for visual object tracking.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Lin Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Lin", "Jiwen Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jiwen", "Jianjiang Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jianjiang", "Jie Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Jie"], "pages": 9}
