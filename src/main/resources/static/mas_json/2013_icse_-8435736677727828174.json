Mainstream modeling techniques can be either informal (white board, CRC cards, etc.) or formal (e.g., UML editors). The former support well the creative modeling process, but their output is difficult to store, process and maintain. The latter reduce these problems, at the expense of creativity and productivity because they are tedious and not trivial to use. We present CEL, a touch- and gesture-based iPad application to rapidly create, manipulate, and store language agnostic object- oriented software models, based on a minimal set of constructs.
