Once these agreements are entered into, it becomes necessary to monitor their conditions, which will commonly relate to timeliness, reliability and request throughput, at run-time. We show how these conditions can be translated into timed automata. Acceptance of a timed word by a timed automaton can be decided in quadratic time and because the timed automata can operate while messages are exchanged at run-time there is effectively only a linear run-time overhead. We present an implementation to derive on-line monitors for web services automatically from SLAs using an Eclipse plugin. We evaluate the efficiency and scalability of this approach using a large-scale case study in a service-oriented computational grid.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["UCL, London, UK", "UCL, London, UK", "UCL, London, UK"], "authors": ["Franco Raimondi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raimondi:Franco", "James Skene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skene:James", "Wolfgang Emmerich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emmerich:Wolfgang"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2008", "pages": 11}
