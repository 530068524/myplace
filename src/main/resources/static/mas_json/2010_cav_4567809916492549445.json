{"title": "Bounded Underapproximations.", "fields": ["state space", "semiring", "context sensitive language", "reachability", "constructive proof", "bounded function", "regular language", "context free language", "commutative property"], "abstract": "We show a new and constructive proof of the following language-theoretic result: for every context-free language L, there is a bounded context-free language L??L which has the same Parikh (commutative) image as L. Bounded languages, introduced by Ginsburg and Spanier, are subsets of regular languages of the form $w_{1}^{*}w_{2}^{*}\\cdots w_{m}^{*}$ for some w 1,?,w m ?\u03a3 ?. In particular bounded context-free languages have nice structural and decidability properties. Our proof proceeds in two parts. First, we give a new construction that shows that each context free language L has a subset L N that has the same Parikh image as L and that can be represented as a sequence of substitutions on a linear language. Second, we inductively construct a Parikh-equivalent bounded context-free subset of L N .\n\nWe show two applications of this result in model checking: to underapproximate the reachable state space of multithreaded procedural programs and to underapproximate the reachable state space of recursive counter programs. The bounded language constructed above provides a decidable underapproximation for the original problems. By iterating the construction, we get a semi-algorithm for the original problems that constructs a sequence of underapproximations such that no two underapproximations of the sequence can be compared. This provides a progress guarantee: every word w?L is in some underapproximation of the sequence, and hence, a program bug is guaranteed to be found. In particular, we show that verification with bounded languages generalizes context-bounded reachability for multithreaded programs.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["IMDEA", "Max Planck Society", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "IMDEA", "University of California, Los Angeles", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Pierre Ganty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganty:Pierre", "Rupak Majumdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majumdar:Rupak", "Benjamin Monmege.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monmege:Benjamin"], "pages": 15}
