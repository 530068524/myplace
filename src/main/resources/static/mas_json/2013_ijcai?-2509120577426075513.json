Unfortunately, Abduction is of high computational complexity; even propositional Abduction is \u03a32P-complete and thus harder than NP and co-NP. This complexity barrier rules out the existence of a polynomial transformation to propositional satisfiability (SAT). In this work we use structural properties of the Abduction instance to break this complexity barrier. We utilize the problem structure in terms of small backdoor sets. We present fixed-parameter tractable transformations from Abduction to SAT, which make the power of today's SAT solvers available to Abduction.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Andreas Pfandler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfandler:Andreas", "Stefan R\u00fcmmele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=uuml=mmele:Stefan", "Stefan Szeider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szeider:Stefan"], "pages": 7}
