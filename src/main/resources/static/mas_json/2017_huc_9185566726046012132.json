Here we describe the clinical model, our participatory approach to designing and deploying the mobile system, and describe the final system. We focus on the integration of the system into providers' clinical workflow and patient registry system. We present lessons learned about the technical and training requirements for integration into practice that can inform future efforts to incorporate health technologies to improve care for patients with psychiatric conditions.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Dimagi", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Amy M.
