{"title": "\"Watts in it for me?\": design implications for implementing effective energy interventions in organisations.", "fields": ["sustainability", "grounded theory", "energy consumption", "psychological intervention", "domestic energy consumption"], "abstract": "The design of technological interventions to motivate behaviour-based reductions in end-user energy consumption has recently been identified as a priority for the HCI community. Previous interventions have produced promising results, but have typically focused on domestic energy consumption. By contrast, this paper focuses on the workplace context, which presents very different opportunities and challenges. For instance, financial consequences, which have proved successful as motivations in the domestic environment, are not present in the workplace in the context of employees. We describe the outcome of a sequence of workshops that focussed on understanding employee perceptions of energy use in the workplace, with the locus of activity on energy intervention design. Using a grounded theory analysis, we produced a framework of key themes detailing user perceptions and energy intervention design considerations. Our findings provide a framework of considerations for the design of successful workplace energy interventions.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["University of Lincoln", "University of Lincoln", "University of Lincoln", "Northumbria University", "University of Lincoln"], "authors": ["Derek Foster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foster:Derek", "Shaun W.
