{"title": "Durable top-k search in document archives.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "ranking", "space partitioning", "the internet", "war"], "abstract": "We propose and study a new ranking problem in versioned databases. Consider a database of versioned objects which have different valid instances along a history (e.g., documents in a web archive). Durable top- k  search finds the set of objects that are consistently in the top- k  results of a query (e.g., a keyword query) throughout a given time interval (e.g., from June 2008 to May 2009). Existing work on temporal top- k  queries mainly focuses on finding the most representative top- k  elements within a time interval. Such methods are not readily applicable to durable top- k  queries. To address this need, we propose two techniques that compute the durable top- k  result. The first is adapted from the classic top- k  rank aggregation algorithm NRA. The second technique is based on a shared execution paradigm and is more efficient than the first approach. In addition, we propose a special indexing technique for archived data. The index, coupled with a space partitioning technique, improves performance even further. We use data from Wikipedia and the Internet Archive to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solutions.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Leong Hou U.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/U:Leong_Hou", "Nikos Mamoulis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mamoulis:Nikos", "Klaus Berberich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berberich:Klaus", "Srikanta J.
