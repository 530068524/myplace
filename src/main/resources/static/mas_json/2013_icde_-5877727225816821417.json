{"title": "RoundTripRank: Graph-based proximity with importance and specificity?", "fields": ["ranking", "random walk", "graph", "scalability", "random graph"], "abstract": "Graph-based proximity has many applications with different ranking needs. However, most previous works only stress the sense of importance by finding \u201cpopular\u201d results for a query. Often times important results are overly general without being well-tailored to the query, lacking a sense of specificity - which only emerges recently. Even then, the two senses are treated independently, and only combined empirically. In this paper, we generalize the well-studied importance-based random walk into a round trip and develop RoundTripRank, seamlessly integrating specificity and importance in one coherent process. We also recognize the need for a flexible trade-off between the two senses, and further develop RoundTripRank+ based on a scheme of hybrid random surfers. For efficient computation, we start with a basic model that decomposes RoundTripRank into smaller units. For each unit, we apply a novel two-stage bounds updating framework, enabling an online top-K algorithm 2SBound. Finally, our experiments show that RoundTripRank and RoundTripRank+ are robust over various ranking tasks, and 2SBound enables scalable online processing.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Singapore Manag ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Yuan Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Yuan", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kevin_Chen=Chuan", "Hady Wirawan Lauw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lauw:Hady_Wirawan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
