We collect a public events video dataset containing 7 topics with 1963 YouTube videos to evaluate our proposed system. The experiment results show that our proposed video feature representation outperforms a state-of-the-art near-duplicate retrieval based on color histogram. The signature generated by random projection not only ensures real-time efficiency but also achieves a competitive MAP performance with original feature.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Guan-Long Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Guan=Long", "Yu-Chuan Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Yu=Chuan", "Tzu-Hsuan Chiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiu:Tzu=Hsuan", "Liang-Chi Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Liang=Chi", "Winston H.
