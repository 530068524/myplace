It makes use of high-accuracy location data collected over 60 days randomly selected from a year in a commercial environment to evaluate the potential for energy savings and to motivate techniques that might be used.   The results suggest that the energy expended on lighting and fast-response systems could have been cut by 50%; that 75.8% of the average user's working day was spent in their office; and that around 140Wh per PC per day could have been saved, compared to a policy that had machines on for the entirety of the working day. We also find inconsistent office usage that would make optimising slow response systems much harder.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Robert K.
