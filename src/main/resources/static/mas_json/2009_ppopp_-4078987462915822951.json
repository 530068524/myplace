{"title": "Formal verification of practical MPI programs.", "fields": ["message passing interface", "algorithmics", "test harness", "distributed memory", "partial order reduction"], "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of formal verification of MPI programs operating under a fixed test harness for safety properties without building verification models. In our approach, we directly model-check the MPI/C source code, executing its interleavings with the help of a verification scheduler. Unfortunately, the total feasible number of interleavings is exponential, and impractical to examine even for our modest goals. Our earlier publications formalized and implemented a partial order reduction approach that avoided exploring equivalent interleavings, and presented a verification tool called ISP. This paper presents algorithmic and engineering innovations to ISP, including the use of OpenMP parallelization, that now enables it to handle practical MPI programs, including:(i)~ParMETIS - a widely used hypergraph partitioner, and (ii)~MADRE - a Memory Aware Data Re-distribution Engine, both developed outside our group. Over these benchmarks, ISP has automatically verified up to 14K lines of MPI/C code, producing error traces of deadlocks and assertion violations within seconds.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Anh Vo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vo:Anh", "Sarvani S.
