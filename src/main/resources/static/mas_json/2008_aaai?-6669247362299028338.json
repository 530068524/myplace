An innovative use of support vector machines (SVMs) with a spectrum representation of packet flows is demonstrated to provide a highly accurate, fast, and robust method for classifying common application protocols. The use of a linear kernel allows for an analysis of SVM feature weights to gain insight into the underlying protocol mechanisms.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Wake Forest University", "Wake Forest University", "Wake Forest University"], "authors": ["William H.
