{"title": "The Complexity of Bribery in Network-Based Rating Systems.", "fields": ["service provider", "distributed computing", "social network", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We study the complexity of bribery in a network-based rating system, where individuals are connected in a social network and an attacker, typically a service provider, can influence their rating and increase the overall profit. We derive a number of algorithmic properties of this framework, in particular we show that establishing the existence of an optimal manipulation strategy for the attacker is NP-complete, even with full knowledge of the underlying network structure.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Padua", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Umberto Grandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grandi:Umberto", "James Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart:James", "Paolo Turrini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turrini:Paolo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
