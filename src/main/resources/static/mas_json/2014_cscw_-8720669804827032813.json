In this paper, we provide a detailed description of a rural cancer navigation organization, specifically detailing the roles collaboration and technology play in supporting navigation work. Examining navigation from a CSCW perspective, we see that navigation is a collaborative care system requiring coordination with patients, providers, and other navigators. Our study reveals a number of design opportunities for supporting navigation in the areas of resource monitoring, knowledge transfer, case management, long term navigation, and development of best practices. Supporting cancer navigation will be a critical step towards improving the healthcare experience for cancer patients.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Maia L.
