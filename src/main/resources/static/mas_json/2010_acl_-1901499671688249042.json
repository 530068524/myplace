{"title": "Hierarchical Joint Learning: Improving Joint Parsing and Named Entity Recognition with Non-Jointly Labeled Data.", "fields": ["natural language processing", "labeled data", "named entity", "named entity recognition", "parsing"], "abstract": "One of the main obstacles to producing high quality joint models is the lack of jointly annotated data. Joint modeling of multiple natural language processing tasks outperforms single-task models learned from the same data, but still under-performs compared to single-task models learned on the more abundant quantities of available single-task annotated data. In this paper we present a novel model which makes use of additional single-task annotated data to improve the performance of a joint model. Our model utilizes a hierarchical prior to link the feature weights for shared features in several single-task models and the joint model. Experiments on joint parsing and named entity recognition, using the OntoNotes corpus, show that our hierarchical joint model can produce substantial gains over a joint model trained on only the jointly annotated data.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jenny Rose Finkel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finkel:Jenny_Rose", "Christopher D.
