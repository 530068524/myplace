{"title": "Applying Max-Sum to Asymmetric Distributed Constraint Optimization.", "fields": ["distributed constraint optimization", "convergence", "mathematical optimization", "local search", "ico"], "abstract": "We study the adjustment and use of the Max-sum algorithm for solving Asymmetric Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (ADCOPs). First, we formalize asymmetric factor-graphs and apply the different versions of Max-sum to them. Apparently, in contrast to local search algorithms, most Max-sum versions perform similarly when solving symmetric and asymmetric problems and some even perform better on asymmetric problems. Second, we prove that the convergence properties of Max-sum_ADVP (an algorithm that was previously found to outperform other Max-sum versions) and the quality of the solutions it produces are dependent on the order between nodes involved in each constraint, i.e., the inner constraint order (ICO). A standard ICO allows to reproduce the properties achieved for symmetric problems, and outperform previously proposed local search ADCOP algorithms. Third, we demonstrate that a non-standard ICO can be used to balance exploration and exploitation, resulting in the best performing Maxsum version on both symmetric and asymmetric standard benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Roie Zivan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zivan:Roie", "Tomer Parash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parash:Tomer", "Yarden Naveh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naveh:Yarden"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
