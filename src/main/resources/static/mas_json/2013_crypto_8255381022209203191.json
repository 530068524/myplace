Design for Testability (DFT) is a design technique that adds certain testability features to a hardware design. On the other hand, this very feature opens up a side channel for cryptanalysis, rendering crypto-devices vulnerable to scan-based attack. Our work studies scan attack as a general threat to stream ciphers and arrives at a general relation between the design of stream ciphers and their vulnerability to scan attack. Finally, we propose a scheme which we show to thwart the attacks and is more secure than other contemporary strategies.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Gemplus Technology R & D", "Bi Guang-guo"], "authors": ["Marc Stevens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stevens:Marc"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 18}
