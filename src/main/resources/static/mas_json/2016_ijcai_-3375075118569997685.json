Inspired by the recent successes of deep neural networks, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep network that predicts protein secondary structures from integrated local and global contextual features. Our deep architecture leverages convolutional neural networks with different kernel sizes to extract multi-scale local contextual features. In addition, considering long-range dependencies existing in amino acid sequences, we set up a bidirectional neural network consisting of gated recurrent unit to capture global contextual features. Furthermore, multitask learning is utilized to predict secondary structure labels and amino-acid solvent accessibility simultaneously. Our proposed deep network demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance, i.e., 69.7% Q8 accuracy on the public benchmark CB513, 76.9% Q8 accuracy on CASP10 and 73.1%Q8 accuracy on CASP11. Our model and results are publicly available.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhen", "Yizhou Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yizhou"], "pages": 8}
