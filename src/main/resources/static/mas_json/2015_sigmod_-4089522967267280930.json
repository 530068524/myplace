{"title": "From Theory to Practice: Efficient Join Query Evaluation in a Parallel Database System.", "fields": ["hash join", "massively parallel", "parallel database", "joins", "sort merge join"], "abstract": "Big data analytics often requires processing complex queries using massive parallelism, where the main performance metrics is the communication cost incurred during data reshuffling. In this paper, we describe a system that can compute efficiently complex join queries, including queries with cyclic joins, on a massively parallel architecture. We build on two independent lines of work for multi-join query evaluation: a communication-optimal algorithm for distributed evaluation, and a worst-case optimal algorithm for sequential evaluation. We evaluate these algorithms together, then describe novel, practical optimizations for both algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Shumo Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Shumo", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena", "Dan Suciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suciu:Dan"], "pages": 16}
