{"title": "Contextual weighting for vocabulary tree based image retrieval.", "fields": ["image retrieval", "weighting", "visual word", "overhead", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of image retrieval from millions of database images. We improve the vocabulary tree based approach by introducing contextual weighting of local features in both descriptor and spatial domains. Specifically, we propose to incorporate efficient statistics of neighbor descriptors both on the vocabulary tree and in the image spatial domain into the retrieval. These contextual cues substantially enhance the discriminative power of individual local features with very small computational overhead. We have conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, i.e., the UKbench, Holidays, and our new Mobile dataset, which show that our method reaches state-of-the-art performance with much less computation. Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrates excellent scalability in terms of both retrieval accuracy and efficiency on large-scale experiments using 1.26 million images from the ImageNet database as distractors.", "citation": "Citations (201)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Missouri", "NEC Laboratorie ... , CA 95014, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... , CA 95014, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... , CA 95014, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... , CA 95014, USA"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Xiaoyu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaoyu", "Ming Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ming", "Timoth\u00e9e Cour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cour:Timoth=eacute=e", "Shenghuo Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Shenghuo", "Kai Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Kai", "Tony X.
