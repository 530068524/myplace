The present study examines conflict in ongoing virtual teams by situating itself in the context of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) development. A series of semi-structured interviews with diverse representatives of the FOSS community highlight differences in the way conflict occurs. Specifically, a transformation of conflict types is observed together with a form of conflict previously unidentified in work on virtual teams. Findings suggest that the changing structure of ongoing virtual teams has important consequences for team processes like conflict.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Anna Filippova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filippova:Anna", "Hichang Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Hichang"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
