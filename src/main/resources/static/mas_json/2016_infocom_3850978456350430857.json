{"title": "Decoding interfering signals with fewer receiving antennas.", "fields": ["spectral efficiency", "latency", "transmitter", "single antenna interference cancellation", "frequency band"], "abstract": "Due to the hierarchical structure and heterogeneity of most deployed wireless networks, multiple data transmissions using the same communication resource, such as frequency band and time slot, are likely to occur in the same area. Hence, interference becomes critical to the decoding of interfered signals. There have already been numerous techniques dealing with interferences that can be implemented either at the transmitter, the receiver or both, to support simultaneous multi-user transmissions. This paper focuses on the reception design in multiple access channels (MACs) where multiple transmitters send data to a common receiver simultaneously. By exploiting the constructive/destructive interactions among interfering signals, we propose a receiver structure based on interference combination (ICom) incorporating zero-forcing (ZF) and successive interference cancellation (SIC). The proposed receiver structure does not require coordination at the transmitter side and can significantly reduce the number of receiving antennas at a moderate processing cost. The ICom-based reception is shown to be able to not only achieve a significant improvement of system spectral efficiency (SE) under stringent latency constraints, but also make a flexible tradeoff between the requirement of receiving antennas and signal processing complexity, thus facilitating its implementation and deployment.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Xidian University", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Zhao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhao", "Xiaoqin Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Xiaoqin", "Kang G.
