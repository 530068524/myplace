{"title": "Easy Samples First: Self-paced Reranking for Zero-Example Multimedia Search.", "fields": ["weighting", "multimedia", "trecvid", "multimedia search", "heuristic"], "abstract": "Reranking has been a focal technique in multimedia retrieval due to its efficacy in improving initial retrieval results. Current reranking methods, however, mainly rely on the heuristic weighting. In this paper, we propose a novel reranking approach called Self-Paced Reranking (SPaR) for multimodal data. As its name suggests, SPaR utilizes samples from easy to more complex ones in a self-paced fashion. SPaR is special in that it has a concise mathematical objective to optimize and useful properties that can be theoretically verified. It on one hand offers a unified framework providing theoretical justifications for current reranking methods, and on the other hand generates a spectrum of new reranking schemes. This paper also advances the state-of-the-art self-paced learning research which potentially benefits applications in other fields. Experimental results validate the efficacy and the efficiency of the proposed method on both image and video search tasks. Notably, SPaR achieves by far the best result on the challenging TRECVID multimedia event search task.", "citation": "Citations (120)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Lu Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0004:Lu", "Deyu Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Deyu", "Teruko Mitamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitamura:Teruko", "Alexander G.
