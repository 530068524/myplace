While previous research has provided a foundational understanding of the social affordances surrounding people's interactions with music, there is a need to update this understanding in light of recent key developments in our digital technological landscape. This paper describes a qualitative study of people's social activities and practices around music in households. It extends previous research by revealing the impact key technologies have on how, where, when, and with who people's interactions surrounding music occur. It also reveals people's creative attempts to design their musical experiences with others through reconfiguring and connecting to various digital technologies and digital platforms in order to pursue more opportunities for communicating, sharing, bonding, and celebrating lives with others.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["Tuck Wah Leong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leong:Tuck_Wah", "Peter C.
