{"title": "Efficient Stream Processing of Scientific Data.", "fields": ["stream processing", "resource efficiency", "complex event processing", "data processing system", "experimental data"], "abstract": "Modern particle physics produces volumes of experimental data that challenge any data processing system. To illustrate, the trigger system of the LHCb experiment at CERN must sustain a data rate of 4 TB/s, yet maintain real-time characteristics. In this work, we report on ELPACO, a distributed event processing platform for scientific data. Its key characteristics are excellent scalability and high resource efficiency. ELPACO inherits its favorable scalability from Apache Storm, which we used as a basis for our platform. For resource efficiency, we tailored ELPACO to Eriador, a parallel, ARM-based hardware substrate with excellent energy/performance characteristics. With experiments on realistic data, we confirm a linear scalability (throughput vs. core count) and a 2.5 \u00d7 improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing solutions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technical University of Dortmund"], "authors": ["Thomas Lindemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindemann:Thomas", "Jonas Kauke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kauke:Jonas", "Jens Teubner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teubner:Jens"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
