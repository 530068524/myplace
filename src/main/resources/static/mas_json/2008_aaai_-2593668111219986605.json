We present an improved WordNet-based learning model which relies on the semantic information of the constituent nouns. The representation of each noun's meaning captures conceptual features which play a key role in the identification of the semantic relation. We report substantial improvements over previous WordNet-based methods on the 2007 SemEval data. Moreover, our experiments show that WordNet's IS-A hierarchy is better suited for some semantic relations compared with others. We also compute various learning curves and show that our model does not need a large number of training examples.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Brandon Beamer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beamer:Brandon", "Alla Rozovskaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rozovskaya:Alla", "Roxana Girju.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Girju:Roxana"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
