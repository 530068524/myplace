{"title": "Supporting the analytical reasoning process in information visualization.", "fields": ["visualization", "information visualization", "analytic reasoning", "visual analytics", "reuse"], "abstract": "This paper presents a new information visualization framework that supports the analytical reasoning process. It consists of three views - a data view, a knowledge view and a navigation view. The data view offers interactive information visualization tools. The knowledge view enables the analyst to record analysis artifacts such as findings, hypotheses and so on. The navigation view provides an overview of the exploration process by capturing the visualization states automatically. An analysis artifact recorded in the knowledge view can be linked to a visualization state in the navigation view. The analyst can revisit a visualization state from both the navigation and knowledge views to review the analysis and reuse it to look for alternate views. The whole analysis process can be saved along with the synthesized information. We present a user study and discuss the perceived usefulness of a prototype based on this framework that we have developed.", "citation": "Citations (199)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yedendra Babu Shrinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrinivasan:Yedendra_Babu", "Jarke J. van Wijk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wijk:Jarke_J=_van"], "pages": 10}
