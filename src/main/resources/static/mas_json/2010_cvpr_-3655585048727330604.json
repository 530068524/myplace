Even though video data is a strong cue for motion analysis, tracking artifacts occur frequently due to ambiguities in the images, rapid motions, occlusions or noise. As a complementary data source, inertial sensors allow for drift-free estimation of limb orientations even under fast motions. However, accurate position information cannot be obtained in continuous operation. Therefore, we propose a hybrid tracker that combines video with a small number of inertial units to compensate for the drawbacks of each sensor type: on the one hand, we obtain drift-free and accurate position information from video data and, on the other hand, we obtain accurate limb orientations and good performance under fast motions from inertial sensors. In several experiments we demonstrate the increased performance and stability of our human motion tracker.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Leibniz University of Hanover", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Gerard Pons-Moll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pons=Moll:Gerard", "Andreas Baak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baak:Andreas", "Thomas Helten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helten:Thomas", "Meinard M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Meinard", "Hans-Peter Seidel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidel:Hans=Peter", "Bodo Rosenhahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenhahn:Bodo"], "pages": 8}
