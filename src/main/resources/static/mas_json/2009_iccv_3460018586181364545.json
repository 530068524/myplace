Specifically, we propose to model multi-camera activities using a Time Delayed Probabilistic Graphical Model (TD-PGM) with different nodes representing activities in different semantically decomposed regions from different camera views, and the directed links between nodes encoding causal relationships between the activities. A novel two-stage structure learning algorithm is formulated to learn globally optimised time-delayed dependencies. A new cumulative abnormality score is also introduced to replace the conventional log-likelihood score for gaining significantly more robust and reliable real-time anomaly detection. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using a camera network installed at a busy underground station.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Chen Change Loy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loy:Chen_Change", "Tao Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Tao", "Shaogang Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Shaogang"], "pages": 8}
