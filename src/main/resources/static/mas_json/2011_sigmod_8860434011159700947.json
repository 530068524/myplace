Inspired by the large amount of recent research on column-oriented stores, we have developed a new specialized analytic data engine tightly-coupled with the Tableau data visualization system. The Tableau Data Engine ships as an integral part of Tableau 6.0 and is intended for the desktop and server environments. This paper covers the main requirements of our project, system architecture and query-processing pipeline. We use real-life visualization scenarios to illustrate basic concepts and provide experimental evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tableau Softwar ... eattle, WA, USA", "Tableau Softwar ... eattle, WA, USA", "Tableau Softwar ... eattle, WA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Richard Michael Grantham Wesley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wesley:Richard_Michael_Grantham", "Matthew Eldridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eldridge:Matthew", "Pawel Terlecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terlecki:Pawel"], "pages": 10}
