To provide text-based pattern searching, the images in the Berkeley  Drosophila  Genome Project (BDGP) study are annotated with ontology terms manually by human curators. We present a systematic approach for automating this task, because the number of images needing text descriptions is now rapidly increasing. We consider both improved feature representation and novel learning formulation to boost the annotation performance. For feature representation, we adapt the bag-of-words scheme commonly used in visual recognition problems so that the image group information in the BDGP study is retained. Moreover, images from multiple views can be integrated naturally in this representation. To reduce the quantization error caused by the bag-of-words representation, we propose an improved feature representation scheme based on the sparse learning technique. In the design of learning formulation, we propose a local regularization framework that can incorporate the correlations among terms explicitly. We further show that the resulting optimization problem admits an analytical solution. Experimental results show that the representation based on sparse learning outperforms the bag-of-words representation significantly. Results also show that incorporation of the term-term correlations improves the annotation performance consistently.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Shuiwang Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Shuiwang", "Lei Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan_0001:Lei", "Ying-Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ying=Xin", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua", "Sudhir Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Sudhir", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
