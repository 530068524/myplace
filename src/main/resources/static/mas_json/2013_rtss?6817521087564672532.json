GPUSync was designed with flexibility, predictability, and parallelism in mind. Specifically, it can be applied under either static-or dynamic priority CPU scheduling, can allocate CPUs/GPUs on a partitioned, clustered, or global basis, provides flexible mechanisms for allocating GPUs to tasks, enables task state to be migrated among different GPUs, with the potential of breaking such state into smaller \"chunks\", provides migration cost predictors that determine when migrations can be effective, enables a single GPU's different engines to be accessed in parallel, properly supports GPU-related interrupt and worker threads according to the sporadic task model, even when GPU drivers are closed-source, and provides budget policing to the extent possible, given that GPU access is non-preemptive. No prior real-time GPU management framework provides a comparable range of features.", "citation": "Citations (38)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Glenn A.
