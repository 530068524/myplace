Most current methods rely on very well-designed features for this new 3D modality. We introduce a model based on a combination of convolutional and recursive neural networks (CNN and RNN) for learning features and classifying RGB-D images. The CNN layer learns low-level translationally invariant features which are then given as inputs to multiple, fixed-tree RNNs in order to compose higher order features. RNNs can be seen as combining convolution and pooling into one efficient, hierarchical operation. Our main result is that even RNNs with random weights compose powerful features. Our model obtains state of the art performance on a standard RGB-D object dataset while being more accurate and faster during training and testing than comparable architectures such as two-layer CNNs.", "citation": "Citations (419)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Richard Socher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Socher:Richard", "Brody Huval.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huval:Brody", "Bharath Putta Bath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bath:Bharath_Putta", "Christopher D.
