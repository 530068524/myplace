{"title": "DemYouth: Co-Designing and Enacting Tools to Support Young People's Engagement with People with Dementia.", "fields": ["applied psychology", "co design", "human computer interaction", "dementia", "qualitative research"], "abstract": "There is a growing body of research examining the role of technology in supporting the care of--and relationships surrounding--people with dementia, yet little attention has been given to how this relates to younger family members. We conducted a qualitative study based on a series of 6 co-design workshops conducted with 14 young people who had personal experience with dementia. Initially, our workshops focused on understanding the difficulties that young people face when engaging, interacting and being with people with dementia. Initial analysis of workshop data informed the design of three digital tool concepts that were used as the basis for user enactment workshops. Our findings highlight the young people's desire to be more involved in their family discussions around dementia and a need for them to find new ways to connect with their loved ones with dementia. We offer a set of design considerations for future systems that support these needs and reflect on some of the complexities we faced around engaging young people in this difficult topic of discussion.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Northumbria University", "Newcastle University", "Youth Focus Nor ...
