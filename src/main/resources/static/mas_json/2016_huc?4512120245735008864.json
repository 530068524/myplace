Hemoglobin measurement is a standard clinical tool commonly used for screening anemia and assessing a patient's response to iron supplement treatments. Given a light source shining through a patient's finger, we perform a chromatic analysis, analyzing the color of their blood to estimate hemoglobin level. We evaluate HemaApp on 31 patients ranging from 6 -- 77 years of age, yielding a 0.82 rank order correlation with the gold standard blood test. In screening for anemia, HemaApp achieve a sensitivity and precision of 85.7% and 76.5%. Both the regression and classification performance compares favorably with our control, an FDA-approved noninvasive hemoglobin measurement device. We also evaluate and discuss the effect of using different kinds of lighting sources.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Seattle Children's", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Seattle Children's", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Electrical Engineering", "Electrical Engineering", "Division of Hem ... gy, Seattle, WA", "Division of Hem ... gy, Seattle, WA"], "authors": ["Edward Jay Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Edward_Jay", "William Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:William", "Doug Hawkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hawkins:Doug", "Terry Gernsheimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gernsheimer:Terry", "Colette Norby-Slycord.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norby=Slycord:Colette", "Shwetak N.
