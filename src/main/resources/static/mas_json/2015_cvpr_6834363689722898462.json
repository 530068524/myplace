{"title": "Functional correspondence by matrix completion.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "correspondence problem", "manifold", "matrix completion", "mathematics"], "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of finding dense intrinsic correspondence between manifolds using the recently introduced functional framework. We pose the functional correspondence problem as matrix completion with manifold geometric structure and inducing functional localization with the L 1  norm. We discuss efficient numerical procedures for the solution of our problem. Our method compares favorably to the accuracy of state-of-the-art correspondence algorithms on non-rigid shape matching benchmarks, and is especially advantageous in settings when only scarce data is available.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Artiom Kovnatsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kovnatsky:Artiom", "Michael M.
