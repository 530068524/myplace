Roughly said, the Thorp shuffle on N cards mixes any N 1 ? 1/r of them in $O(r\\lg N)$ steps. Correspondingly, making O(r) passes of maximally unbalanced Feistel over an n-bit string ensures CCA-security to 2 n(1 ? 1/r) queries. Our results, which employ Markov-chain techniques, enable the construction of a practical and provably-secure blockcipher-based scheme for deterministically enciphering credit card numbers and the like using a conventional blockcipher.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Ben Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Ben", "Phillip Rogaway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogaway:Phillip", "Till Stegers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stegers:Till"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2009", "pages": 17}
