We present a novel social annotation analysis approach for identification of news articles' political orientation. The approach focuses on the behavior of individual commenters. It uncovers commenters' sentiment patterns towards political news articles, and predicts the political orientation from the sentiments expressed in the comments. It takes advantage of commenters' participation as well as their knowledge and intelligence condensed in the sentiment of comments, thereby greatly reduces the high complexity of political view identification. We conduct extensive study on commenters' behaviors, and discover predictive commenters showing a high degree of regularity in their sentiment patterns. We develop and evaluate sentiment pattern-based methods for political view identification.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Souneil Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Souneil", "Minsam Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko:Minsam", "Jungwoo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jungwoo", "Ying Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0006:Ying", "Junehwa Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junehwa"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
