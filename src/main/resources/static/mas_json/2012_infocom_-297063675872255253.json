{"title": "Maximizing capacity with power control under physical interference model in duplex mode.", "fields": ["power control", "open problem", "approximation algorithm", "approximation theory", "bounded function"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the joint selection and power assignment of a largest set of given links which can communicate successfully at the same time under the physical interference model in the duplex (i.e. bidirectional) mode. For the special setting in which all nodes have unlimited maximum transmission power, Halldorsson and Mitra [5] developed an approximation algorithm with a huge constant approximation bound. For the general setting in which all nodes have bounded maximum transmission power, the existence of constant approximation algorithm remains open. In this paper, we resolve this open problem by developing an approximation algorithm which not only works for the general setting of bounded maximum transmission power, but also has a much smaller constant approximation bound.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences", "Hangzhou Dianzi University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "Dechang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Dechang", "Guojun Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Guojun", "Zhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhu", "F.
