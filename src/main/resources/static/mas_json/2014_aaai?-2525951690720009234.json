{"title": "A Framework for Task Planning in Heterogeneous Multi Robot Systems Based on Robot Capabilities.", "fields": ["concurrency", "robotics", "planning domain definition language", "personal robot", "data flow diagram"], "abstract": "In heterogeneous multi-robot teams, robustness and flexibility are increased by the diversity of the robots, each contributing different capabilities. Yet platform-independence is desirable when planning actions for the various robots. We propose a platform-independent model of robot capabilities which we use as a planning domain.We extend existing planning techniques to support two requirements: generating new objects during planning; and, required concurrency of actions due to data flow which can be cyclic. The first requires online action instantiation, the second a small extension of the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL): allowing predicates in continuous effects. We evaluate the planner on benchmark domains and present results on an example object transportation task in simulation.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Jennifer Elisabeth Buehler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buehler:Jennifer_Elisabeth", "Maurice Pagnucco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pagnucco:Maurice"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
