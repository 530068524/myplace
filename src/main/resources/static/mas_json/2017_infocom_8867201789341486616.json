In this paper, we present an in-depth study to characterize the surprisingly notable systemic impacts of low-pass filter (LPF) design, which is a small yet indispensable component used for shaping spectrum and rejecting interference. Using a bottom-up approach, we examine how signal-level distortions caused by the trade-off of LPF design propagate to the upper-layers of wireless communication, reshaping bit error patterns and degrading link performance of today's 802.11 systems. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm that harnesses LPF defects for improving video streaming, which substantially enhances video quality in mobile environments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Peking University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University"], "authors": ["Alireza Ameli Renani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Renani:Alireza_Ameli", "Jun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Jun", "Guoliang Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Guoliang", "Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esfahanian:Abdol=Hossein"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
