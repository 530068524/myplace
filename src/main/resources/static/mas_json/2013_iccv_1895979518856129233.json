{"title": "Learning to Predict Gaze in Egocentric Video.", "fields": ["computer vision", "gaze", "image segmentation", "latent variable", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "We present a model for gaze prediction in egocentric video by leveraging the implicit cues that exist in camera wearer's behaviors. Specifically, we compute the camera wearer's head motion and hand location from the video and combine them to estimate where the eyes look. We further model the dynamic behavior of the gaze, in particular fixations, as latent variables to improve the gaze prediction. Our gaze prediction results outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin on publicly available egocentric vision datasets. In addition, we demonstrate that we get a significant performance boost in recognizing daily actions and segmenting foreground objects by plugging in our gaze predictions into state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (152)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yin", "Alireza Fathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fathi:Alireza", "James M.
