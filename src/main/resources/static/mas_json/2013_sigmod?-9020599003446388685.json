LinkIT implements novel algorithms that support data transformations for linking sensitive attributes, and is designed to work with our previously developed tool, FRIL (Fine-grained Record Integration and Linkage), to provide a complete record linkage solution. LinkIT can be also used as a stand-alone secure transformation tool to link string records. The system uses a novel embedding technique based on frequent variable length grams mined from original records with differential privacy, and utilizes a personalized threshold for performing linkage in the embedded space. Compared to the state-of-the-art secure transformation method [16], LinkIT guarantees stronger privacy with better scalability while achieving comparable utility results.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Emory University", "Emory University", "Emory University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Luca Bonomi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonomi:Luca", "Li Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong_0001:Li", "James J.
