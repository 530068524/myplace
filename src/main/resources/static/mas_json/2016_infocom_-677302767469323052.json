{"title": "Tracker-assisted rate adaptation for MPEG DASH live streaming.", "fields": ["live streaming", "dash", "download", "throughput", "web server"], "abstract": "MPEG DASH is a widely used standard for adaptive video streaming over HTTP. The conceptual architecture for DASH includes a web server and clients, which download media segments from the server. Clients select the resolution of video segments by using an Adaptive Bit-Rate (ABR) strategy; in particular, a throughput-based ABR is used in the case of live video applications. However, recent papers show that these strategies may suffer from the presence of proxies/caches in the network, which are instrumental in streaming video on a large scale. To face this issue, we propose to extend the MPEG DASH architecture with a Tracker functionality, enabling client-to-client sharing of control information. This extension paves the way to a novel family of Tracker-assisted strategies that allow a greater design flexibility, while solving the specific issue caused by proxies/caches; in addition, its utility goes beyond the problem at hand, as it can be used by other applications as well, e.g. for peer-to-peer streaming.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Rome Tor Vergata", "University of Rome Tor Vergata", "University of Rome Tor Vergata"], "authors": ["Andrea Detti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Detti:Andrea", "Bruno Ricci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ricci:Bruno", "Nicola Blefari-Melazzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blefari=Melazzi:Nicola"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
