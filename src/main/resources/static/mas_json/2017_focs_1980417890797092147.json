{"title": "On the Quantitative Hardness of CVP.", "fields": ["exponential time hypothesis", "special case", "euclidean distance", "norm", "integer"], "abstract": "For odd integers p \u2265 1 (and p = \u221e), we show that the Closest Vector Problem in the \u2113p norm (CVP_p) over rank n lattices cannot be solved in 2^(1-\u2265) n time for any constant \u2265 0 unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails. We then extend this result to almost all values of p \u2265 1, not including the even integers. This comes tantalizingly close to settling the quantitative time complexity of the important special case of CVP_2 (i.e., CVP in the Euclidean norm), for which a 2^{n +o(n)}-time algorithm is known. In particular, our result applies for any p = p(n) \u2260 2 that approaches 2 as n \u21a6 \u221e.We also show a similar SETH-hardness result for SVP_\u221e; hardness of approximating CVP_p to within some constant factor under the so-called Gap-ETH assumption; and other hardness results for CVP_p and CVPP_p for any 1 \u2264 p", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Yahoo!", "New York University"], "authors": ["Huck Bennett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bennett:Huck", "Alexander Golovnev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovnev:Alexander", "Noah Stephens-Davidowitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stephens=Davidowitz:Noah"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
