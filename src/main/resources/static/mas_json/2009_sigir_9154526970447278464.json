{"title": "Learning in a pairwise term-term proximity framework for information retrieval.", "fields": ["learning to rank", "pairwise comparison", "machine learning", "closeness", "ranking"], "abstract": "Traditional ad hoc retrieval models do not take into account the closeness or proximity of terms. Document scores in these models are primarily based on the occurrences or non-occurrences of query-terms considered independently of each other. Intuitively, documents in which query-terms occur closer together should be ranked higher than documents in which the query-terms appear far apart.   This paper outlines several term-term proximity measures and develops an intuitive framework in which they can be used to fully model the proximity of all query-terms for a particular topic. As useful proximity functions may be constructed from many proximity measures, we use a learning approach to combine proximity measures to develop a useful proximity function in the framework. An evaluation of the best proximity functions show that there is a significant improvement over the baseline ad hoc retrieval model and over other more recent methods that employ the use of single proximity measures.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Digital Enterprise Research Institute", "Dept. of Inform ...
