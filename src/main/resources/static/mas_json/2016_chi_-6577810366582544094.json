In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of the peer production model across the rural/urban divide, a divide that has been shown to be an important factor in many online social systems. We find that in both Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap, peer-produced content about rural areas is of systematically lower quality, is less likely to have been produced by contributors who focus on the local area, and is more likely to have been generated by automated software agents (i.e. \"bots\"). We then codify the systemic challenges inherent to characterizing rural phenomena through peer production and discuss potential solutions.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Minnesota", "Wikimedia Found ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Isaac L.
