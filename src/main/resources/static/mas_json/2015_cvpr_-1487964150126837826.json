The image and caption data are represented by the outputs of the vision and text based deep neural networks. The high dimensionality of the features presents a great challenge in terms of memory and speed complexity when used in DCCA framework. We address these problems by a GPU implementation and propose methods to deal with overfitting. This makes it possible to evaluate DCCA approach on popular caption-image matching benchmarks. We compare our approach to other recently proposed techniques and present state of the art results on three datasets.", "citation": "Citations (156)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of Surrey"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Fei Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Fei", "Krystian Mikolajczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mikolajczyk:Krystian"], "pages": 10}
