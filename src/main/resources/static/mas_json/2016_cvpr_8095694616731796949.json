Whereas the existing work mainly pursues utilizing attributes for various computer vision problems, we contend that the most basic problem\u2014how to accurately and robustly detect attributes from images\u2014has been left under explored. Especially, the existing work rarely explicitly tackles the need that attribute detectors should generalize well across different categories, including those previously unseen. Noting that this is analogous to the objective of multi-source domain generalization, if we treat each category as a domain, we provide a novel perspective to attribute detection and propose to gear the techniques in multi-source domain generalization for the purpose of learning cross-category generalizable attribute detectors. We validate our understanding and approach with extensive experiments on four challenging datasets and three different problems.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "University of Iowa", "CRCV, U. of Cen ... rlando, FL, USA"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chuang Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Chuang", "Tianbao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Tianbao", "Boqing Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Boqing"], "pages": 11}
