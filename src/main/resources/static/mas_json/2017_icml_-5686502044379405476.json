In this paper, we consider the problem of how to design the optimal control policy for point processes, such that the stochastic system driven by the point process is steered to a target state. In particular, we exploit the key insight to view the stochastic optimal control problem from the perspective of optimal measure and variational inference. We further propose a convex optimization framework and an efficient algorithm to update the policy adaptively to the current system state. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our algorithm can steer the user activities much more accurately and efficiently than other stochastic control methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yichen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yichen", "Grady Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Grady", "Evangelos Theodorou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theodorou:Evangelos", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le"], "pages": 10}
