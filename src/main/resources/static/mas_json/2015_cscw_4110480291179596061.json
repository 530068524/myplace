{"title": "Predicting a Community's Flu Dynamics with Mobile Phone Data.", "fields": ["public health", "social computing", "infectious disease", "mobile phone", "disease"], "abstract": "Human interactions that are sensed ubiquitously by mobile phones can improve a significant number of public health problems, particularly helping to track the spread of disease. In this paper, we evaluate multiple avenues for the integration of high-resolution face to face Bluetooth-sensed interaction networks into standard epidemic models. Our goal is to evaluate the capacity of the different avenues of integration to track the spread of seasonal influenza on a real-world community of 72 individuals over a period of 17 weeks. The dataset considered contains real-time tracking of individual flu symptoms over the whole observation period, providing a concrete individualized source for evaluation. We obtain an error of less than 2 infected people on average for predicting the total number of individuals affected by the flu and precision of approximately 30% when predicting exactly which individual will become infected at a given time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study considering mobile phone Bluetooth-sensed interaction data for dynamic infectious disease simulation that is evaluated against real human influenza occurrence. Our remarkable results indicate that high-resolution mobile phone data can increase the predictive power of even the simplest of epidemic models.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Goldsmiths, University of London", "University of Melbourne", "Laboratoire Hub ... \u00c9tienne, France"], "authors": ["Katayoun Farrahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farrahi:Katayoun", "R\u00e9mi Emonet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emonet:R=eacute=mi", "Manuel Cebri\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cebri=aacute=n:Manuel"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
