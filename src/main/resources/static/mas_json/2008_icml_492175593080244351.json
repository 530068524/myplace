This paper extends the classical principal component analysis (PCA) to its multilinear version by proposing a novel unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm for tensorial data, named as uncorrelated multilinear PCA (UMPCA). UMPCA seeks a tensor-to-vector projection that captures most of the variation in the original tensorial input while producing uncorrelated features through successive variance maximization. We evaluate the UMPCA on a second-order tensorial problem, face recognition, and the experimental results show its superiority, especially in low-dimensional spaces, through the comparison with three other PCA-based algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Ryerson University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Haiping Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Haiping", "Konstantinos N.
