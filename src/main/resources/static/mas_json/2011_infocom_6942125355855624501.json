Without colluding, each ISP may selfishly set a high transit-price to cover its cost and maximize its own profit, which inevitably results in a loss in social profit. We model this noncooperative interaction between an \u201ceyeball\u201d ISP and a \u201ccontent\u201d ISP as a Stackelberg game and quantify the resulting loss in social profit. To recover the profit loss, we propose a revenue sharing contract between ISPs by modeling them as a supply chain to deliver traffic in a two-sided market. Parameterized by the profit division factor, the sharing contract coordinates ISPs' objectives such that they aim to maximize the social profit self-incentively. We further propose a Nash bargaining process to determine the profit division factor such that all ISPs are simultaneously better off compared to the noncooperative equilibrium.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Bell Labs", "Qualcomm", "Princeton University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Yuan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yuan", "Hongseok Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hongseok", "Prashanth Hande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hande:Prashanth", "Mung Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang:Mung", "Danny H.
