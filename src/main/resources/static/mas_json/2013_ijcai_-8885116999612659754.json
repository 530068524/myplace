{"title": "Algorithms for Generating Ordered Solutions for Explicit AND/OR Structures : Extended Abstract.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "discrete mathematics", "spacetime", "matrix chain multiplication", "best first search"], "abstract": "We present algorithms for generating alternative solutions for explicit acyclic AND/OR structures in non-decreasing order of cost. Our algorithms use a best first search technique and report the solutions using an implicit representation ordered by cost. Experiments on randomly constructed AND/OR DAGs and problem domains including matrix chain multiplication, finding the secondary structure of RNA, etc, show that the proposed algorithms perform favorably to the existing approach in terms of time and space.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Cornell University", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Priyankar Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Priyankar", "Amit Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Amit", "Partha Pratim Chakrabarti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakrabarti:Partha_Pratim", "Pallab Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Pallab"], "pages": 5}
