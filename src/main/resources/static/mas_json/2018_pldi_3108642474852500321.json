{"title": "Gluon: a communication-optimizing substrate for distributed heterogeneous graph analytics.", "fields": ["analytics", "exploit", "gluon", "thread", "graph partition"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a new approach to building distributed-memory graph analytics systems that exploits heterogeneity in processor types (CPU and GPU), partitioning policies, and programming models. The key to this approach is Gluon, a communication-optimizing substrate.    Programmers write applications in a shared-memory programming system of their choice and interface these applications with Gluon using a lightweight API. Gluon enables these programs to run on heterogeneous clusters and optimizes communication in a novel way by exploiting structural and temporal invariants of graph partitioning policies.    To demonstrate Gluon\u2019s ability to support different programming models, we interfaced Gluon with the Galois and Ligra shared-memory graph analytics systems to produce distributed-memory versions of these systems named D-Galois and D-Ligra, respectively. To demonstrate Gluon\u2019s ability to support heterogeneous processors, we interfaced Gluon with IrGL, a state-of-the-art single-GPU system for graph analytics, to produce D-IrGL, the first multi-GPU distributed-memory graph analytics system.    Our experiments were done on CPU clusters with up to 256 hosts and roughly 70,000 threads and on multi-GPU clusters with up to 64 GPUs. The communication optimizations in Gluon improve end-to-end application execution time by \u223c2.6\u00d7 on the average. D-Galois and D-IrGL scale well and are faster than Gemini, the state-of-the-art distributed CPU graph analytics system, by factors of \u223c3.9\u00d7 and \u223c4.9\u00d7, respectively, on the average.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Roshan Dathathri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dathathri:Roshan", "Gurbinder Gill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gill:Gurbinder", "Loc Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Loc", "Hoang-Vu Dang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dang:Hoang=Vu", "Alex Brooks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brooks:Alex", "Nikoli Dryden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dryden:Nikoli", "Marc Snir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snir:Marc", "Keshav Pingali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pingali:Keshav"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2018", "pages": 17}
