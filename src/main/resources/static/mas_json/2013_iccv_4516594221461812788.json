It first formulates the 3-D motion segmentation from two perspective views as a subspace clustering problem, utilizing the epipolar constraint of an image pair. It then combines the point correspondence information across multiple image frames via a collaborative clustering step, in which tight integration is achieved via a mixed norm optimization scheme. For model selection, we propose an over-segment and merge approach, where the merging step is based on the property of the ell_1-norm of the mutual sparse representation of two over-segmented groups. The resulting algorithm can deal with incomplete trajectories and perspective effects substantially better than state-of-the-art two-frame and multi-frame methods. Experiments on a 62-clip dataset show the significant superiority of the proposed idea in both segmentation accuracy and model selection.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Zhuwen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhuwen", "Jiaming Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jiaming", "Loong-Fah Cheong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheong:Loong=Fah", "Steven Zhiying Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Steven_Zhiying"], "pages": 8}
