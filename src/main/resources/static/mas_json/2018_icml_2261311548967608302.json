It founds on a constructive methodology to build a deep architecture comprising layers of probabilistic models that learn to encode the structured information in an incremental fashion. Context is diffused in an efficient and scalable way across the graph vertexes and edges. The resulting graph encoding is used in combination with discriminative models to address structure classification benchmarks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Pisa", "University of Pisa", "University of Pisa"], "authors": ["Davide Bacciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bacciu:Davide", "Federico Errica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Errica:Federico", "Alessio Micheli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micheli:Alessio"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
