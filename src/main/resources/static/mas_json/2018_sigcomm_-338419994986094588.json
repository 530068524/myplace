{"title": "AWStream: adaptive wide-area streaming analytics.", "fields": ["stream processing", "analytics", "pedestrian detection", "profiling", "low latency"], "abstract": "The emerging class of wide-area streaming analytics faces the challenge of scarce and variable WAN bandwidth. Non-adaptive applications built with TCP or UDP suffer from increased latency or degraded accuracy. State-of-the-art approaches that adapt to network changes require developer writing sub-optimal manual policies or are limited to application-specific optimizations.   We present AWStream, a stream processing system that simultaneously achieves low latency and high accuracy in the wide area, requiring minimal developer efforts. To realize this, AWStream uses three ideas: ( i ) it integrates application adaptation as a first-class programming abstraction in the stream processing model; ( ii ) with a combination of offline and online profiling, it automatically learns an accurate profile that models accuracy and bandwidth trade-off; and ( iii ) at runtime, it carefully adjusts the application data rate to match the available bandwidth while maximizing the achievable accuracy. We evaluate AWStream with three real-world applications: augmented reality, pedestrian detection, and monitoring log analysis. Our experiments show that AWStream achieves sub-second latency with only nominal accuracy drop (2-6%).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Johns Hopkins University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Ben Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ben", "Xin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xin", "Sylvia Ratnasamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ratnasamy:Sylvia", "John Wawrzynek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wawrzynek:John", "Edward A.
