We propose a general framework capable of enhancing various types of neural networks (e.g., CNNs and RNNs) with declarative first-order logic rules. Specifically, we develop an iterative distillation method that transfers the structured information of logic rules into the weights of neural networks. We deploy the framework on a CNN for sentiment analysis, and an RNN for named entity recognition. With a few highly intuitive rules, we obtain substantial improvements and achieve state-of-the-art or comparable results to previous best-performing systems.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhiting Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Zhiting", "Xuezhe Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xuezhe", "Zhengzhong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhengzhong", "Eduard H.
