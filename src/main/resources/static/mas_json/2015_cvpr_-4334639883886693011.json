In our method, 3D facial models are restored from 2D images, which provide crucial clues for the enhancement of robustness to overcome large changes including out-of-plane head rotations, fast head motions and partial facial occlusions. To accurately recognize the emotion, a novel random forest-based algorithm which simultaneously integrates two regressions for 3D facial tracking and continuous emotion estimation is constructed. Moreover, via the reconstructed 3D facial model, temporal information and user-independent emotion presentations are also taken into account through our image fusion process. The experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art result with higher Pearson's correlation coefficient of continuous emotion recognition in real time.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hui", "Jiangdong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiangdong", "Fengjun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Fengjun", "Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang", "Hongan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hongan"], "pages": 10}
