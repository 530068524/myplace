In such applications, I/O-intensive background tasks, such as checkpointing, are the major culprit in worsening the latency due to the contention in shared I/O stack and storage. To minimize the contention, properly prioritizing I/Os is crucial but the effectiveness of existing approaches is limited for two reasons. First, statically deciding the priority of an I/O is insufficient since high-priority tasks can wait for low-priority I/Os due to I/O priority inversion. Second, multiple independent layers in modern storage stacks are not holistically considered by existing approacheswhich thereby fail to effectively prioritize I/Os throughout the I/O path.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a request-centric I/O prioritization that dynamically detects and prioritizes I/Os delaying request handling at all layers in the I/O path. The proposed scheme is implemented on Linux and is evaluated with three applications, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. The evaluation results show that our scheme achieves up to 53% better request throughput and 42\u00d7 better 99th percentile request latency (84 ms vs. 3581 ms), compared to the default configuration in Linux.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Sungkyunkwan University", "Sungkyunkwan University", "Sungkyunkwan University", "Sungkyunkwan University"], "authors": ["Sangwook Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sangwook", "Hwanju Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hwanju", "Joonwon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joonwon", "Jinkyu Jeong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeong:Jinkyu"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
