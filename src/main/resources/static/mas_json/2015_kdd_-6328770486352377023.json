{"title": "Towards Interactive Construction of Topical Hierarchy: A Recursive Tensor Decomposition Approach.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "recursion", "tensor", "generative model", "topic model"], "abstract": "Automatic construction of user-desired topical hierarchies over large volumes of text data is a highly desirable but challenging task. This study proposes to give users freedom to construct topical hierarchies via interactive operations such as expanding a branch and merging several branches. Existing hierarchical topic modeling techniques are inadequate for this purpose because (1) they cannot consistently preserve the topics when the hierarchy structure is modified; and (2) the slow inference prevents swift response to user requests. In this study, we propose a novel method, called STROD, that allows efficient and consistent modification of topic hierarchies, based on a recursive generative model and a scalable tensor decomposition inference algorithm with theoretical performance guarantee. Empirical evaluation shows that STROD reduces the runtime of construction by several orders of magnitude, while generating consistent and quality hierarchies.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Chi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Chi", "Xueqing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xueqing", "Yanglei Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yanglei", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
