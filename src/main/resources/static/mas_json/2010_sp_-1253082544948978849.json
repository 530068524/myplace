The authors identify many individuals who have contributed to SSP as program chairs, general chairs, and heads of the overseeing IEEE technical committee. They recognize SSP participants who have provided significant leadership in creating and funding opportunities for research and development in security and privacy. Some contributions to advances in security are also discussed in following articles by Carl Landwehr and Douglas Maughan, both of whom have been major instigators of R&D programs at multiple US government agencies. The authors also highlight some influential SSP papers from three decades, and also efforts that have had significant impact in providing or stimulating effective technology transfer, as well as authors and educators whose work provided major contributions to academic curricula, all helping instill trustworthiness into computercommunication security. Finally, they identify some of the anniversary event honorees.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["SRI International", "University of California, Davis", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Peter G.
