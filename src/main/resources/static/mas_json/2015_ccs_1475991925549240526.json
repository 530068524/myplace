{"title": "Insecurity of Voice Solution VoLTE in LTE Mobile Networks.", "fields": ["network packet", "telephony", "voice over ip", "adversary", "data access"], "abstract": "VoLTE (Voice-over-LTE) is the designated voice solution to the LTE mobile network, and its worldwide deployment is underway. It reshapes call services from the traditional circuit-switched telecom telephony to the packet-switched Internet VoIP. In this work, we conduct the first study on VoLTE security before its full rollout. We discover several vulnerabilities in both its control-plane and data-plane functions, which can be exploited to disrupt both data and voice in operational networks. In particular, we find that the adversary can easily gain free data access, shut down continuing data access, or subdue an ongoing call, etc. We validate these proof-of-concept attacks using commodity smartphones (rooted and unrooted) in two Tier-1 US mobile carriers. Our analysis reveals that, the problems stem from both the device and the network. The device OS and chipset fail to prohibit non-VoLTE apps from accessing and injecting packets into VoLTE control and data planes. The network infrastructure also lacks proper access control and runtime check.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Ohio State University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Chi-Yu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chi=Yu", "Guan-Hua Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Guan=Hua", "Chunyi Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Chunyi", "Zengwen Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Zengwen", "Yuanjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanjie", "Songwu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Songwu", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing"], "pages": 12}
