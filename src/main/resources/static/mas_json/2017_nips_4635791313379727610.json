In this paper, we leverage recent developments to propose a class of non-parametric models which have very attractive computational and statistical properties. Our approach relies on the simple function space assumption that the conditional distribution of each variable conditioned on the other variables has a non-parametric exponential family form.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Chicago", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Arun Sai Suggala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suggala:Arun_Sai", "Mladen Kolar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolar:Mladen", "Pradeep Ravikumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravikumar:Pradeep"], "pages": 11}
