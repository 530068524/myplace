{"title": "Hierarchical Object Representation for Open-Ended Object Category Learning and Recognition.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "concept learning", "method", "data transfer object", "latent dirichlet allocation"], "abstract": "Most robots lack the ability to learn new objects from past experiences. To migrate a robot to a new environment one must often completely re-generate the knowledge- base that it is running with. Since in open-ended domains the set of categories to be learned is not predefined, it is not feasible to assume that one can pre-program all object categories required by robots. Therefore, autonomous robots must have the ability to continuously execute learning and recognition in a concurrent and interleaved fashion. This paper proposes an open-ended 3D object recognition system which concurrently learns both the object categories and the statistical features for encoding objects. In particular, we propose an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to learn structural semantic features (i.e. topics) from low-level feature co-occurrences for each category independently. Moreover, topics in each category are discovered in an unsupervised fashion and are updated incrementally using new object views. The approach contains similarities with the organization of the visual cortex and builds a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated representations. Results show the fulfilling performance of this approach on different types of objects. Moreover, this system demonstrates the capability of learning from few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Aveiro", "University of Aveiro", "University of Aveiro"], "authors": ["Seyed Hamidreza Kasaei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasaei:Seyed_Hamidreza", "Ana Maria Tom\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tom=eacute=:Ana_Maria", "Lu\u00eds Seabra Lopes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lopes:Lu=iacute=s_Seabra"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
