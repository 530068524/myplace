However, they are not known for their compliance with desirable axiomatic properties, which we attempt to rectify here. We characterize runoff rules that are based on scoring rules using two axioms: a weakening of local independence of irrelevant alternatives and a variant of population-consistency. We then show, as our main technical result, that STV is the only runoff scoring rule satisfying an independence-of-clones property. Furthermore, we provide axiomatizations of Baldwin's rule and Coombs' rule.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Rupert Freeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freeman:Rupert", "Markus Brill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brill:Markus", "Vincent Conitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conitzer:Vincent"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
