This  beta process factor analysis  (BP-FA) model allows for a dataset to be decomposed into a linear combination of a sparse set of factors, providing information on the underlying structure of the observations. As with the Dirichlet process, the beta process is a fully Bayesian conjugate prior, which allows for analytical posterior calculation and straightforward inference. We derive a varia-tional Bayes inference algorithm and demonstrate the model on the MNIST digits and HGDP-CEPH cell line panel datasets.", "citation": "Citations (255)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["John William Paisley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paisley:John_William", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
