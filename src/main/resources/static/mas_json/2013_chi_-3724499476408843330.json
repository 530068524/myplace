{"title": "A value sensitive action-reflection model: evolving a co-design space with stakeholder and designer prompts.", "fields": ["social environment", "co design", "stakeholder", "mobile technology", "value sensitive design"], "abstract": "We introduce a design method for evolving a co-design space to support stakeholders untrained in design. Specifically, the purpose of the method is to expand and shape a co-design space so that stakeholders, acting as designers, focus not only on the form and function of a tool being envisioned but also on the social context of its use and values that lie with individuals, groups, and societies. The method introduces value sensitive stakeholder prompts and designer prompts into a co-design process, creating a particular kind of reflection-on-action cycle. The prompts provide a means for bringing empirical data on values and theoretical perspective into the co-design process. We present the method in terms of a general model, the Value Sensitive Action-Reflection Model; place the model within discourse on co-design spaces; and illustrate the model with a discussion of its application in a lo-fi prototyping activity around safety for homeless young people. We conclude with reflections on the model and method.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Delft University of Technology", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Daisy Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Daisy", "Alina Huldtgren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huldtgren:Alina", "Jill Palzkill Woelfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woelfer:Jill_Palzkill", "David G.
