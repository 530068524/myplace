In contrast to current state-of-art connectivity-based localization methods, the proposed algorithm is fully distributed, where each node only needs the information of its neighbors, without cumbersome partitioning and merging process. The algorithm is highly scalable, with limited error propagation and linear computation and communication cost with respect to the size of the network. Moreover, the algorithm is theoretically guaranteed and numerically stable. Extensive simulations and comparison with other methods under various representative network settings are carried out, showing superior performance of the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "departments": ["University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Miao Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Miao", "Su Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Su", "Hongyi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Hongyi", "Xianfeng Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Xianfeng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
