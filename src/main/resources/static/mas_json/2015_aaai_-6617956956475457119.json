Unlike most existing approaches, which are primarily efficient for modelling pairwise relations between entities, we attempt to explicitly model both pairwise relations and long-range interactions between entities, by interpreting them as linear operators on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Therefore, in this paper we introduces path ranking to capture the long-range interactions of knowledge graph and at the same time preserve the pairwise relations of knowledge graph; we call it structured embedding via pairwise relation and long-range interactions (referred to as SePLi). Comparing with the-state-of-the-art models, SePLi achieves better performances of embeddings.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Jun Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song_0004:Jun", "Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Yi", "Xi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xi", "Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongfei_=Mark=", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
