The first is a direct adaptation of the standard sequent calculus to the deep inference setting, and we describe a procedure for cut elimination, similar to the one from the sequent calculus, but using a non-local rewriting. The second system is the symmetric completion of the first, as normally given in deep inference for logics with a DeMorgan duality: all inference rules have duals, as cut is dual to the identity axiom. We prove a generalisation of cut elimination, that we call symmetric normalisation, where all rules dual to standard ones are permuted up in the derivation. The result is a decomposition theorem having cut elimination and interpolation as corollaries.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "authors": ["Nicolas Guenot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guenot:Nicolas", "Lutz Stra\u00dfburger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stra=szlig=burger:Lutz"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
