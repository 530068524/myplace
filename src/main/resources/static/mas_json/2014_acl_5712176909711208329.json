In this study, we address a key aspect of language proficiency assessment \u2010 syntactic complexity. We propose a novel measure of syntactic complexity for spontaneous speech that shows optimum empirical performance on real world data in multiple ways. First, it is both robust and reliable, producing automatic scores that agree well with human rating compared to the stateof-the-art. Second, the measure makes sense theoretically, both from algorithmic and native language acquisition points of view.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Pittsburgh", "Educational Testing Service"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Suma Bhat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhat:Suma", "Huichao Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Huichao", "Su-Youn Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Su=Youn"], "pages": 11}
