Motivated by the existence of data structures of this type, we explore the computation of associativity scores, otherwise known as pointwise mutual information (PMI), in a streaming context. We give theoretical bounds showing the impracticality of perfect online PMI computation, and detail an algorithm with high expected accuracy. Experiments on news articles show our approach gives high accuracy on real world data.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Benjamin Van Durme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durme:Benjamin_Van", "Ashwin Lall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lall:Ashwin"], "pages": 9}
