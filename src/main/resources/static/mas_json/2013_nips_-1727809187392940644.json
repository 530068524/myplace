{"title": "Gaussian Process Conditional Copulas with Applications to Financial Time Series.", "fields": ["copula", "covariate", "conditioning", "gaussian process"], "abstract": "The estimation of dependencies between multiple variables is a central problem in the analysis of financial time series. A common approach is to express these dependencies in terms of a copula function. Typically the copula function is assumed to be constant but this may be inaccurate when there are covariates that could have a large influence on the dependence structure of the data. To account for this, a Bayesian framework for the estimation of conditional copulas is proposed. In this framework the parameters of a copula are non-linearly related to some arbitrary conditioning variables. We evaluate the ability of our method to predict time-varying dependencies on several equities and currencies and observe consistent performance gains compared to static copula models and other time-varying copula methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "Autonomous University of Madrid"], "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hern=aacute=ndez=Lobato:Jos=eacute=_Miguel", "James Robert Lloyd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lloyd:James_Robert", "Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hern=aacute=ndez=Lobato:Daniel"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
