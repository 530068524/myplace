Our design uses a single antenna for simultaneous TX/RX (i.e., the same resources as a standard half duplex system). We also propose novel analog and digital cancellation techniques that cancel the self interference to the receiver noise floor, and therefore ensure that there is no degradation to the received signal. We prototype our design by building our own analog circuit boards and integrating them with a fully WiFi-PHY compatible software radio implementation. We show experimentally that our design works robustly in noisy indoor environments, and provides close to the expected theoretical doubling of throughput in practice.", "citation": "Citations (1,322)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "IMEC", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "InterDigital, Inc.", "InterDigital, Inc.", "Yonsei University", "Yonsei University", "National Instruments", "Yonsei University", "Yonsei University", "University of Oulu", "University of California, Riverside", "Curtin University", "University of California, Irvine", "Integrated Circuit Design", "TTI", "Integrated Circuit Design", "NEC Laboratorie ... rica, Inc., USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... rica, Inc., USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... rica, Inc., USA"], "authors": ["Dinesh Bharadia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bharadia:Dinesh", "Emily McMilin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McMilin:Emily", "Sachin Katti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katti:Sachin"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
