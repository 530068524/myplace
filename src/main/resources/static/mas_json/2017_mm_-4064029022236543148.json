Inspired by human's \"nonsalient-to-salient\" perception path, the proposed hashing scheme generates a series of binary codes based on progressively expanded salient regions. Built on a recurrent deep network, i.e., LSTM structure, the binary codes generated from later output nodes naturally inherit information aggregated from previously codes while explore novel information from the extended salient region, and therefore it possesses good scalability property. The proposed deep hashing network is trained via minimizing a triplet ranking loss, which is end-to-end trainable. Extensive experimental results on several image retrieval benchmarks demonstrate good performance gain over state-of-the-art image retrieval methods and its scalability property.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Jiale Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Jiale", "Bingbing Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Bingbing", "Minsi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Minsi", "Yang Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yang", "Hanjiang Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Hanjiang", "Chongyang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chongyang", "Lin Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Lin", "Chuanping Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Chuanping", "Chen Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Chen"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
