This problem is computationally hard, and there are very few automated approaches for its solution. To solve this problem we propose an algorithm, called Circuit-Decomposition Engine (CDE), that is based on learning decision trees, and uses a greedy approach for function learning. We empirically demonstrate that CDE, when given a library of different component types, can learn the function of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) Boolean representations and synthesize circuit structure using the input library. We compare the structure of the synthesized circuits with that of well-known circuits using a range of circuit similarity metrics.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University College Cork", "University College Cork", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University College Cork", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University College Cork"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Lior Rokach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rokach:Lior", "Meir Kalech.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalech:Meir", "Gregory M.
