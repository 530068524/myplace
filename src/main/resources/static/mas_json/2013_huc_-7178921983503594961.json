One prominent example is media facades. Due to their size, visibility and their technical capabilities, they offer great potential for interaction and for becoming the future displays of public spaces. To explore their potential, researchers have recently started to develop interactive applications for various media facades. Existing development tools are mostly tailored to one specific media facade in one specific setting. They usually provide limited means to incorporate interaction by a user, and the applications developed are limited to running on only one particular media facade. In this paper, we present a flexible, generalized media facade toolkit, which is capable of mimicking arbitrary media facade installations. The toolkit is capable of running interactive applications on media facades with different form factors, sizes and technical capabilities. Furthermore, it ensures application portability between different media facades and offers the possibility of providing interactivity by enabling user input with different modalities and different interaction devices.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence"], "authors": ["Sven Gehring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehring:Sven", "Elias Hartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartz:Elias", "Markus L\u00f6chtefeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=ouml=chtefeld:Markus", "Antonio Kr\u00fcger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=ger:Antonio"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
