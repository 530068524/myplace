The estimation update step is cast as an optimization problem for which we can prove the global minimum is reachable via a bidirectional search using Gauss-Newton's method along a one-dimensional manifold. While the filter is designed for mapping just one landmark, it is easily extended to full-scale multiple-landmark SLAM. We provide this extension via a formulation of bearing-only FastSLAM. With experiments, we demonstrate accurate and convergent estimation in situations where an EKF solution would diverge.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Stephen Tully.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tully:Stephen", "George Kantor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kantor:George", "Howie Choset.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choset:Howie"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
