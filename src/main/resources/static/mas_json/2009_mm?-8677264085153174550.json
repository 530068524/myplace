Although sophisticated equipments can be used to produce scenery such as fire and smoke, usually, the approach is expensive and perhaps dangerous. Can sceneries be re-produced based on existing videos using digital technology? The answer is yes but it is difficult. In this video demonstration, we propose new mechanisms using motion inpainting technologies. Dynamic texture can be altered and reused under control. In addition, actors with repeated motion can be interpolated or extrapolated and incorporated into the falsified scenery. We demonstrate using our tool to produce realistic video narratives based on existing videos. Five sets of results as well as the source videos used are available at http://member.mine.tku.edu.tw/www/ACMMM09VideoDemo.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "Tamkang University", "Tamkang University", "Asia University", "Academia Sinica"], "authors": ["Nick C.
