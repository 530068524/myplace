More specifically, given a resolution proof that a state machine beginning at an initial state satisfies some property at cycle  k  , we show that the existence of a  \u0394  -invariant cut implies that the property holds for cycles  k  +  \u0394  ,  k  + 2 \u0394  , etc. We suggest a linear algorithm for identifying such  \u0394  -extendible proofs and develop the required theory for covering all cycles by  \u0394  -extendible proofs. To expose  \u0394  -invariant cuts, we develop an efficient proof manipulation algorithm that rearranges the proof by the natural temporal order. We demonstrate the applicability of our techniques on a few real-life examples.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Oded Fuhrmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuhrmann:Oded", "Shlomo Hoory.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoory:Shlomo"], "pages": 13}
