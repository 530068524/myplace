We construct a constrained sparse regression problem that enforces both Lambertian, rank-3 structure and sparse, additive corruptions. A solution method is derived using a hierarchical Bayesian approximation to accurately estimate the surface normals while simultaneously separating the non-Lambertian corruptions. Extensive evaluations are performed that show state-of-the-art performance using both synthetic and real-world images.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Satoshi Ikehata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikehata:Satoshi", "David P.
