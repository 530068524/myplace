Any such data structure that retrieves stretch 2k \u2126 1 paths must require space \u2126(n 1+1/k ) for graphs of n nodes. The hard cases that enforce this lower bound are, however, rather dense graphs with average degree \u2126(n 1/k ).", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Rachit Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal_0001:Rachit", "Philip Brighten Godfrey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Godfrey:Philip_Brighten", "Sariel Har-Peled.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Har=Peled:Sariel"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
