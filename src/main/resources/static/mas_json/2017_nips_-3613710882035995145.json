While estimation of covariance matrices corresponding to sub-Gaussian distributions is well-understood, much less in known in the case of heavy-tailed data. As K. Balasubramanian and M. Yuan write, ``data from real-world experiments oftentimes tend to be corrupted with outliers and/or exhibit heavy tails. In such cases, it is not clear that those covariance matrix estimators .. remain optimal'' and ``..what are the other possible strategies to deal with heavy tailed distributions warrant further studies.'' We make a step towards answering this question and prove tight deviation inequalities for the proposed estimator that depend only on the parameters controlling the ``intrinsic dimension'' associated to the covariance matrix (as opposed to the dimension of the ambient space); in particular, our results are applicable in the case of high-dimensional observations.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Xiaohan Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Xiaohan", "Stanislav Minsker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minsker:Stanislav"], "pages": 10}
