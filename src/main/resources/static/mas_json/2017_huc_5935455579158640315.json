While several studies have been performed on large-scale activity tracking using a watch-type wearable device, large-scale activity tracking using an eyewear-type wearable device remains a challenging area owing to the negative effect of such devices on a user's appearance. In this paper, we describe the initial result of a large-scale longitudinal study about the concentration level of users using an eyewear-type wearable device. Our approach is to use an eyewear-type wearable device and a predeveloped mobile application to collect data about eye blinks and head posture. The concentration level of users is estimated based on blink rate, blink strength, and head posture. We collected over 40,000 hours of data, and the result shows the change in concentration in a week and with time.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["JINS Inc., Japan", "JINS Inc., Japan"], "authors": ["Yuji Uema.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uema:Yuji", "Kazutaka Inoue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inoue:Kazutaka"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
