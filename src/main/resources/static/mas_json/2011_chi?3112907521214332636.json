We report on a qualitative study of two family groups who used a custom-built tracking application for an extended period of time. Akin to sociological breaching experiments, the study focuses on the interferences between location tracking and relationship management. We analyze the tensions that can arise between affordances of the technology and uses that the  contracts  between family members legitimize. We describe how, by fostering misperceptions and 'nudging' behaviors, location-tracking technology can generate anxieties and conflicts even in close relationships. We discuss their vulnerability to the overreaching effects of tracking, against which the use of mechanisms such as location-sharing preferences and feedback may not be socially viable.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Open University", "Open University", "Open University", "University of Bath", "Open University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Clara Mancini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancini:Clara", "Yvonne Rogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogers:Yvonne", "Keerthi Thomas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomas:Keerthi", "Adam N.
