An OWL/DL-Based Approach.", "fields": ["robustness", "part of speech", "security token", "correctness", "ontology"], "abstract": "This paper describes a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that the parallel application of multiple NLP tools and the integration of their results improves the correctness and robustness of the resulting analysis.\n\nIt is shown how annotations created by seven NLP tools are mapped onto tool-independent descriptions that are defined with reference to an ontology of linguistic annotations, and how a majority vote and ontological consistency constraints can be used to integrate multiple alternative analyses of the same token in a consistent way.\n\nFor morphosyntactic (parts of speech) and morphological annotations of three German corpora, the resulting merged sets of ontological descriptions are evaluated in comparison to (ontological representation of) existing reference annotations.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Potsdam"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Christian Chiarcos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiarcos:Christian"], "pages": 12}
