{"title": "BigDebug: interactive debugger for big data analytics in Apache Spark.", "fields": ["download", "debugging", "debugger", "algorithmic program debugging", "breakpoint"], "abstract": "To process massive quantities of data, developers leverage data-intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems in the cloud, such as Google's MapReduce, Apache Hadoop, and Apache Spark. In terms of debugging, DISC systems support post-mortem log analysis but do not provide interactive debugging features in realtime. This tool demonstration paper showcases a set of concrete usecases on how BigDebug can help debug Big Data Applications by providing interactive, realtime debug primitives. To emulate interactive step-wise debugging without reducing throughput, BigDebug provides simulated breakpoints to enable a user to inspect a program without actually pausing the entire computation. To minimize unnecessary communication and data transfer, BigDebug provides on-demand watchpoints that enable a user to retrieve intermediate data using a guard and transfer the selected data on demand. To support systematic and efficient trial-and-error debugging, BigDebug also enables users to change program logic in response to an error at runtime and replay the execution from that step.
