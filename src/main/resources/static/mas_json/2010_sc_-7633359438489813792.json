The CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming model provides improved programmability for general computing on GPGPUs. However, its unique execution model and memory model still pose significant challenges for developers of efficient GPGPU code. This paper proposes a new programming interface, called OpenMPC, which builds on OpenMP to provide an abstraction of the complex CUDA programming model and offers high-level controls of the involved parameters and optimizations. We have developed a fully automatic compilation and user-assisted tuning system supporting OpenMPC. In addition to a range of compiler transformations and optimizations, the system includes tuning capabilities for generating, pruning, and navigating the search space of compilation variants. Our results demonstrate that OpenMPC offers both programmability and tunability. Our system achieves 88% of the performance of the hand-coded CUDA programs.", "citation": "Citations (261)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Seyong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Seyong", "Rudolf Eigenmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eigenmann:Rudolf"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2010", "pages": 11}
