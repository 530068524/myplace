This makes it necessary to explore post hoc explanation methods. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of explanation methods for NLP. To this end, we design two novel evaluation paradigms that cover two important classes of NLP problems: small context and large context problems. Both paradigms require no manual annotation and are therefore broadly applicable. We also introduce LIMSSE, an explanation method inspired by LIME that is designed for NLP. We show empirically that LIMSSE, LRP and DeepLIFT are the most effective explanation methods and recommend them for explaining DNNs in NLP.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Hinrich Sch\u00fctze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=tze:Hinrich", "Benjamin Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Benjamin", "Nina P\u00f6rner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=ouml=rner:Nina"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
