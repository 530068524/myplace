{"title": "Failures of Gradient-Based Deep Learning.", "fields": ["deep learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In recent years, Deep Learning has become the go-to solution for a broad range of applications, often outperforming state-of-the-art. However, it is important, for both theoreticians and practitioners, to gain a deeper understanding of the difficulties and limitations associated with common approaches and algorithms. We describe four types of simple problems, for which the gradient-based algorithms commonly used in deep learning either fail or suffer from significant difficulties. We illustrate the failures through practical experiments, and provide theoretical insights explaining their source, and how they might be remedied.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Shai Shalev-Shwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalev=Shwartz:Shai", "Ohad Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamir:Ohad", "Shaked Shammah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shammah:Shaked"], "pages": 9}
