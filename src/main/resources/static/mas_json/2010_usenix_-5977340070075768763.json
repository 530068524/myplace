{"title": "An Evaluation of Per-Chip Nonuniform Frequency Scaling on Multicores.", "fields": ["frequency scaling", "cpu shielding", "voltage", "chip", "cpu power dissipation"], "abstract": "Concurrently running applications on multiprocessors may desire different CPU frequency/voltage settings in order to achieve performance, power, or thermal objectives. Today's multicores typically require that all sibling cores on a single chip run at the same frequency/ voltage level while different CPU chips can have non-uniform settings. This paper targets multicorebased symmetric platforms and demonstrates the benefits of per-chip adaptive frequency scaling on multicores. Specifically, by grouping applications with similar frequency-to-performance effects, we create the opportunity for setting a chip-wide desirable frequency level. We run experiments with 12 SPECCPU2000 benchmarks and two server-style applications on a machine with two dual-core Intel \"Woodcrest\" processors. Results show that per-chip frequency scaling can save \u223c20 watts of CPU power while maintaining performance within a specified bound of the original system.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Xiao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiao", "Sandhya Dwarkadas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dwarkadas:Sandhya", "Rongrong Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Rongrong"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
