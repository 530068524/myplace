A lot of algorithms on graphs are ad-hoc in the sense that each of them assumes that the underlying graph data can be organized in a certain way that maximizes the performance of the algorithm. In other words, there is no standard graph systems based on which graph algorithms are developed and optimized. In response to this situation, a lot of graph systems have been proposed recently. In this tutorial, we discuss several representative systems. Still, we focus on providing perspectives from a variety of standpoints on the goals and the means for developing a general purpose graph system. We highlight the challenges posed by the graph data, the constraints of architectural design, the different types of application needs, and the power of different programming models that support such needs.   This tutorial is complementary to the related tutorial \"Managing and Mining Large Graphs: Patterns and Algorithms\".", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Fudan University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Bin Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Bin", "Haixun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haixun", "Yanghua Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Yanghua"], "pages": 4}
