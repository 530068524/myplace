{"title": "On Effective Personalized Music Retrieval by Exploring Online User Behaviors.", "fields": ["data mining", "personalized search", "information retrieval", "topic model", "active listening"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of personalized text based music retrieval which takes users' music preferences on songs into account via the analysis of online listening behaviours and social tags. Towards the goal, a novel Dual-Layer Music Preference Topic Model (DL-MPTM) is proposed to construct latent music interest space and characterize the correlations among (user, song, term). Based on the DL-MPTM, we further develop an effective personalized music retrieval system. To evaluate the system's performance, extensive experimental studies have been conducted over two test collections to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art music retrieval methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms those approaches in terms of personalized search accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University"], "authors": ["Zhiyong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Zhiyong", "Jialie Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Jialie", "Steven C.
