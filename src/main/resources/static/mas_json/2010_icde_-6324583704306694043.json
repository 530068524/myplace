Rather than aborting and restarting queries, our system, Osprey, divides running queries into subqueries, and replicates data such that each subquery can be rerun on a different node if the node initially responsible fails or returns too slowly. Our approach is inspired by the fault tolerance properties of MapReduce, in which map or reduce jobs are greedily assigned to workers, and failed jobs are rerun on other workers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Christopher Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Christopher", "Christine Yen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yen:Christine", "Ceryen Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Ceryen", "Samuel Madden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madden:Samuel"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
