Under the single-carrier constraint, the problem of MaxWeight scheduling, as well as that of determining if a given number of packets can be served from all the users, are shown to be NP-complete. Finally, a matching-based scheduling algorithm is presented that requires only a polynomial number of computations per timeslot, and in the case of a system with large bandwidth and user population, provably provides a good delay (small-queue) performance, even under the single-carrier constraint. In summary, the results in first part of the paper support the recent push to remove SCFDMA from the Standards, whereas those in the second part present a way of working around the single-carrier constraint if it remains in the Standards.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Qualcomm", "Qualcomm"], "authors": ["Shreeshankar Bodas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodas:Shreeshankar", "Bilal Sadiq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadiq:Bilal"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
