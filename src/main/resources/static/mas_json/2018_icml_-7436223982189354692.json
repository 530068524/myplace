{"title": "Gradient Coding from Cyclic MDS Codes and Expander Graphs.", "fields": ["training set", "empirical risk minimization", "expander graph", "adjacency matrix", "bottleneck"], "abstract": "Gradient Descent, and its variants, are a popular method for solving empirical risk minimization problems in machine learning. However, if the size of the training set is large, a computational bottleneck is the computation of the gradient, and hence, it is common to distribute the training set among worker nodes. Doing this in a synchronous fashion faces yet another challenge of stragglers (i.e., slow or unavailable nodes) which might cause a considerable delay, and hence, schemes for mitigation of stragglers are essential. It was recently shown by Tandon et al. that stragglers can be avoided by carefully assigning redundant computations to the worker nodes and coding across partial gradients, and a randomized construction for the coding was given. In this paper we obtain a comparable deterministic scheme by employing cyclic MDS codes. In addition, we propose replacing the exact computation of the gradient with an approximate one; a technique which drastically increases the straggler tolerance, and stems from adjacency matrices of expander graphs.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "Apple Inc.", "University of Texas at Austin", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Netanel Raviv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raviv:Netanel", "Rashish Tandon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tandon:Rashish", "Alex Dimakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimakis:Alex", "Itzhak Tamo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamo:Itzhak"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
