{"title": "Non-convex Conditional Gradient Sliding.", "fields": ["regular polygon", "mathematical optimization", "gradient method", "pattern recognition", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "We investigate a projection free method, namely conditional gradient sliding on batched, stochastic and finite-sum non-convex problem. CGS is a smart combination of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method and Frank-Wolfe (FW) method, and outperforms FW in the convex setting by saving gradient computations. However, the study of CGS in the non-convex setting is limited. In this paper, we propose the non-convex conditional gradient sliding (NCGS) which surpasses the non-convex Frank-Wolfe method in batched, stochastic and finite-sum setting.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Chao Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Chao", "Yan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yan", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
