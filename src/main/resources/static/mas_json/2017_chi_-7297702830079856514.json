{"title": "Showing People Behind Data: Does Anthropomorphizing Visualizations Elicit More Empathy for Human Rights Data?", "fields": ["prosocial behavior", "narrative", "empathy", "chart", "graphics"], "abstract": "We investigate the impact of using anthropomorphized data graphics over standard charts on viewers' empathy for, and prosocial behavior toward suffering populations, in the context of human rights narratives. We present a series of experiments conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk, in which we compare various forms of anthropomorphized data graphics-ranging from a single human figure that \"fills up\" to show proportional data, to separated groups of individual human beings-with a standard chart baseline. Each experiment uses two carefully crafted human rights data-driven stories to present the graphics. Contrary to our expectations, we consistently find that anthropomorphized data graphics and standard charts have very similar effects on empathy and prosocial behavior.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["United Nations", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jeremy Boy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boy:Jeremy", "Anshul Vikram Pandey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandey:Anshul_Vikram", "John Emerson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emerson:John", "Margaret Satterthwaite.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satterthwaite:Margaret", "Oded Nov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nov:Oded", "Enrico Bertini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertini:Enrico"], "pages": 13}
