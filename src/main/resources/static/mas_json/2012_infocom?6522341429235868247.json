In contrast to prior schemes, which have expended energy in the form of cooperative jamming to enable secrecy, we develop schemes where multiple transmitters send their signals in a cooperative fashion to confuse the eavesdroppers. Hence, power is not expended on \u201cartificial noise\u201d; rather, the signal of a given transmitter is protected by the aggregate interference produced by the other transmitters. We introduce a two-hop strategy for the case of equal path-loss between all pairs of nodes, and then consider its embedding within a multi-hop approach for the general case of an extended network. In each case, we derive an achievable number of eavesdroppers that can be present in the region while secure communication between all sources and intended destinations is ensured.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Azadeh Sheikholeslami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheikholeslami:Azadeh", "Dennis Goeckel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goeckel:Dennis", "Hossein Pishro-Nik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pishro=Nik:Hossein", "Don Towsley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Towsley:Don"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
