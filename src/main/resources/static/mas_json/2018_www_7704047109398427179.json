It has been shown that category matching of entities, especially when matching to fine-grained entity categories, is critical to the performance of entity search. However, the potentials of fine-grained Wikipedia categories, has not been well exploited by existing studies. Based on the observation of how people describe entities of a specific type, we propose a headword-and-modifier model to deeply interpret both queries and fine-grained entity categories. Probabilistic generative models are designed to effectively estimate the relevance of headwords and modifiers as a pattern-based matching problem, taking the Wikipedia type taxonomy as an important input to address the ad-hoc representations of concepts/entities in queries. Extensive experimental results on three widely-used test sets: INEX-XER 2009, SemSearch-LS and TREC-Entity,  show that our method achieves a significant improvement of the entity search performance over the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Renmin University of China"], "authors": ["Denghao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Denghao", "Yueguo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yueguo", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kevin_Chen=Chuan", "Xiaoyong Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Xiaoyong", "Chuanfei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chuanfei", "Yi Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
