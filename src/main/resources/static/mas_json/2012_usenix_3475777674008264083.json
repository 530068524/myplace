{"title": "Primary Data Deduplication - Large Scale Study and System Design.", "fields": ["data deduplication", "windows server", "metadata", "file server", "chunking"], "abstract": "We present a large scale study of primary data deduplication and use the findings to drive the design of a new primary data deduplication system implemented in the Windows Server 2012 operating system. File data was analyzed from 15 globally distributed file servers hosting data for over 2000 users in a large multinational corporation.\n\nThe findings are used to arrive at a chunking and compression approach which maximizes deduplication savings while minimizing the generated metadata and producing a uniform chunk size distribution. Scaling of deduplication processing with data size is achieved using a RAM frugal chunk hash index and data partitioning - so that memory, CPU, and disk seek resources remain available to fulfill the primary workload of serving IO.\n\nWe present the architecture of a new primary data deduplication system and evaluate the deduplication performance and chunking aspects of the system.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Ahmed El-Shimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/El=Shimi:Ahmed", "Ran Kalach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalach:Ran", "Ankit Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Ankit", "Adi Ottean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ottean:Adi", "Jin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Jin", "Sudipta Sengupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sengupta:Sudipta"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
