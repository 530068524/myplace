We constructed several large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are offered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.", "citation": "Citations (783)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Xiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiang", "Junbo Jake Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Junbo_Jake", "Yann LeCun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/LeCun:Yann"], "pages": 9}
