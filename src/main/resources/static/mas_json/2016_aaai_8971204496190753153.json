{"title": "Adaptable Regression Method for Ensemble Consensus Forecasting.", "fields": ["probabilistic forecasting", "ensemble forecasting", "global forecast system", "consensus forecast", "forecast bias"], "abstract": "Accurate weather forecasts enhance sustainability by facilitating decision making across a broad range of endeavors including public safety, transportation, energy generation and management, retail logistics, emergency preparedness, and many others. This paper presents a method for combining multiple scalar forecasts to obtain deterministic predictions that are generally more accurate than any of the constituents. Exponentially-weighted forecast bias estimates and error covariance matrices are formed at observation sites, aggregated spatially and temporally, and used to formulate a constrained, regularized least squares regression problem that may be solved using quadratic programming. The model is re-trained when new observations arrive, updating the forecast bias estimates and consensus combination weights to adapt to weather regime and input forecast model changes. The algorithm is illustrated for 0-72 hour temperature forecasts at over 1200 sites in the contiguous U.S. based on a 22-member forecast ensemble, and its performance over multiple seasons is compared to a state-of-the-art ensemble-based forecasting system. In addition to weather forecasts, this approach to consensus may be useful for ensemble predictions of climate, wind energy, solar power, energy demand, and numerous other quantities.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["The Weather Com ... y, Andover, MA", "The Weather Com ... y, Andover, MA", "The Weather Com ... y, Andover, MA", "The Weather Com ... y, Andover, MA"], "authors": ["John K.
