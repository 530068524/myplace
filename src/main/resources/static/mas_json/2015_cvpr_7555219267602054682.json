First, a weak saliency map is constructed based on image priors to generate training samples for a strong model. Second, a strong classifier based on samples directly from an input image is learned to detect salient pixels. Results from multiscale saliency maps are integrated to further improve the detection performance. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed bootstrap learning algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art saliency detection methods. Furthermore, we show that the proposed bootstrap learning approach can be easily applied to other bottom-up saliency models for significant improvement.", "citation": "Citations (174)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Omron", "University of California, Merced"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Na Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Na", "Huchuan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Huchuan", "Xiang Ruan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruan:Xiang", "Ming-Hsuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Ming=Hsuan"], "pages": 9}
