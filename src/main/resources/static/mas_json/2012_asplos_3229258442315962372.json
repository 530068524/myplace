{"title": "An update-aware storage system for low-locality update-intensive workloads.", "fields": ["logical disk", "i o scheduling", "disk buffer", "disk mirroring", "continuation"], "abstract": "Traditional storage systems provide a simple read/write interface, which is inadequate for  low-locality update-intensive  workloads because it limits the disk scheduling flexibility and results in inefficient use of buffer memory and raw disk bandwidth. This paper describes an  update-aware  disk access interface that allows applications to explicitly specify disk update requests and associate with such requests call-back functions that will be invoked when the requested disk blocks are brought into memory. Because call-back functions offer a  continuation  mechanism after retrieval of requested blocks, storage systems supporting this interface are given more flexibility in scheduling pending disk update requests. In particular, this interface enables a simple but effective technique called  Batching mOdifications with Sequential Commit  (BOSC), which greatly improves the sustained throughput of a storage system under low-locality update-intensive workloads. In addition, together with a space-efficient low-latency disk logging technique, BOSC is able to deliver the same durability guarantee as synchronous disk updates. Empirical measurements show that the random update throughput of a BOSC-based B+ tree is more than an order of magnitude higher than that of the same B+ tree implementation on a traditional storage system.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "IBM", "Industrial Technology Research Institute"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Dilip Nijagal Simha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simha:Dilip_Nijagal", "Maohua Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Maohua", "Tzi-cker Chiueh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiueh:Tzi=cker"], "pages": 12}
