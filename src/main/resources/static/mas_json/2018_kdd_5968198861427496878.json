{"title": "D2K: Scalable Community Detection in Massive Networks via Small-Diameter k-Plexes.", "fields": ["graph enumeration", "exploit", "degeneracy", "scalability", "algorithm engineering"], "abstract": "This paper studies k-plexes, a well known pseudo-clique model for network communities. In a k-plex, each node can miss at most k-1 links. Our goal is to detect large communities in today's real-world graphs which can have hundreds of millions of edges. While many have tried, this task has been elusive so far due to its computationally challenging nature: k-plexes and other pseudo-cliques are harder to find and more numerous than cliques, a well known hard problem. We present D2K, which is the first algorithm able to find large k-plexes of very large graphs in just a few minutes. The good performance of our algorithm follows from a combination of graph-theoretical concepts, careful algorithm engineering and a high-performance implementation. In particular, we exploit the low degeneracy of real-world graphs, and the fact that large enough k-plexes have diameter 2. We validate a sequential and a parallel/distributed implementation of D2K on real graphs with up to half a billion edges.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics", "University of Pisa", "University of Pisa", "University of Pisa", "University of Pisa"], "authors": ["Alessio Conte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conte:Alessio", "Tiziano De Matteis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matteis:Tiziano_De", "Daniele De Sensi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sensi:Daniele_De", "Roberto Grossi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossi:Roberto", "Andrea Marino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marino:Andrea", "Luca Versari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Versari:Luca"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
