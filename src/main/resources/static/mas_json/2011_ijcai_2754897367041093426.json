We consider a new approach for circumventing this result: we consider randomized voting rules that only approximate a deterministic voting rule and only are approximately strategy-proof. We show that any deterministic voting rule can be approximated by an approximately strategy-proof randomized voting rule, and we provide asymptotically tight lower bounds on the parameters required by such voting rules.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Eleanor Birrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Birrell:Eleanor", "Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael"], "pages": 6}
