{"title": "Kripke Semantics for Modal Bilattice Logic.", "fields": ["multimodal logic", "kripke structure", "normal modal logic", "s5", "kripke semantics"], "abstract": "We employ the well-developed and powerful techniques of algebraic semantics and Priestley duality to set up a Kripke semantics for a modal expansion of Arieli and Avron's bilattice logic, itself based on Belnap's four-valued logic. We obtain soundness and completeness of a Hilbert-style derivation system for this logic with respect to four-valued Kripke frames, the standard notion of model in this setting. The proof is via intermediary relational structures which are analysed through a topological reading of one of the axioms of the logic. Both local and global consequence on the models are covered.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Birmingham", "University of Birmingham"], "authors": ["Achim Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Achim", "Umberto Rivieccio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rivieccio:Umberto"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
