{"title": "Polynomial Spaces: A New Framework for Composite-to-Prime-Order Transformations.", "fields": ["prime", "composite number", "cryptosystem", "polynomial", "order of magnitude"], "abstract": "At Eurocrypt 2010, Freeman presented a framework to convert cryptosystems based on composite-order groups into ones that use prime-order groups. Such a transformation is interesting not only from a conceptual point of view, but also since for relevant parameters, operations in prime-order groups are faster than composite-order operations by an order of magnitude. Since Freeman\u2019s work, several other works have shown improvements, but also lower bounds on the efficiency of such conversions.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Ruhr University Bochum", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Gottfried Herold.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herold:Gottfried", "Julia Hesse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hesse:Julia", "Dennis Hofheinz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofheinz:Dennis", "Carla R\u00e0fols.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=agrave=fols:Carla", "Andy Rupp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rupp:Andy"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2014", "pages": 19}
