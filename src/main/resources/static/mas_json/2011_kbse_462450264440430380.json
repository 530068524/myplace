Many software model checkers only explore the state space of a single multi-threaded process. Recent work proposes a technique that applies a cache to capture communication between the main process and its peers, and allows the model checker to complete state-space exploration. Although previous work handles non-deterministic output in the main process, any peer program is required to produce deterministic output. This paper introduces a process checkpointing tool. The combination of caching and process checkpointing makes it possible to handle non-determinism on both sides of communication. Peer states are saved as checkpoints and restored when the model checker backtracks and produces a request not available in the cache. We also introduce the concept of strategies to control the creation of checkpoints and the overhead caused by the checkpointing tool.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "University of Tokyo", "National Institute of Informatics", "Chiba University"], "authors": ["Watcharin Leungwattanakit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leungwattanakit:Watcharin", "Cyrille Artho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Artho:Cyrille", "Masami Hagiya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hagiya:Masami", "Yoshinori Tanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanabe:Yoshinori", "Mitsuharu Yamamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamamoto:Mitsuharu"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
