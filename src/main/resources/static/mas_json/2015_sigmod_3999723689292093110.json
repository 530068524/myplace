{"title": "SharkDB: An In-Memory Storage System for Massive Trajectory Data.", "fields": ["trajectory", "computer data storage", "mobile device", "asynchronous communication", "social network"], "abstract": "An increasing amount of motion history data, which is called trajectory, is being collected from different sources such as GPS-enabled mobile devices, surveillance cameras and social networks. However it is hard to store and manage trajectory data in traditional database systems, since its variable lengths and asynchronous sampling rates do not fit disk-based and tuple-oriented structures, which are the fundamental structures of traditional database systems. We implement a novel trajectory storage system that is motivated by the success of column store and recent development of in-memory based databases. In this storage design, we try to explore the potential opportunities, which can boost the performance of query processing for trajectory data. To achieve this, we partition the trajectories into frames as column-oriented storage in order to store the sample points of a moving object, which are aligned by the time interval, within the main memory. Furthermore, the frames can be highly compressed and well structured to increase the memory utilization ratio and reduce the CPU-cache missing. It is also easier for parallelizing data processing on the multi-core server since the frames are mutually independent.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Haozhou Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haozhou", "Kai Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Kai", "Xiaofang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaofang", "Shazia Wasim Sadiq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadiq:Shazia_Wasim"], "pages": 6}
