MiniBox can be applied in Platform-as-a-Service cloud computing to provide two-way protection between a customer's application and the cloud platform OS. We implement a Mini-Box prototype running on recent x86 multi-core systems from Intel or AMD, and we port several applications to MiniBox. Evaluation results show that MiniBox is efficient and practical.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Google", "Google", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Google"], "authors": ["Yanlin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yanlin", "Jonathan M.
