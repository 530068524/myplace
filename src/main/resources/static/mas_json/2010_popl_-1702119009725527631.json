{"title": "Automatic numeric abstractions for heap-manipulating programs.", "fields": ["integer", "imperative programming", "heap", "separation logic", "shape analysis"], "abstract": "We present a logic for relating heap-manipulating programs to numeric abstractions. These numeric abstractions are expressed as simple imperative programs over integer variables and have the property that termination and safety of the numeric program ensures termination and safety of the original, heap-manipulating program. We have implemented an automated version of this abstraction process and present experimental results for programs involving a variety of data structures.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "National Taiwan University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Stephen Magill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magill:Stephen", "Ming-Hsien Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Ming=Hsien", "Peter Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Peter", "Yih-Kuen Tsay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsay:Yih=Kuen"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
