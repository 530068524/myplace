{"title": "Bayesian Joint Inversions for the Exploration of Earth Resources.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "inversion", "probabilistic logic", "gaussian process", "modalities"], "abstract": "We propose a machine learning approach to geophysical inversion problems for the exploration of earth resources. Our approach is based on nonparametric Bayesian methods, specifically, Gaussian processes, and provides a full distribution over the predicted geophysical properties whilst enabling the incorporation of data from different modalities. We assess our method both qualitatively and quantitatively using a real dataset from South Australia containing gravity and drill-hole data and through simulated experiments involving gravity, drill-holes and magnetics, with the goal of characterizing rock densities. The significance of our probabilistic inversion extends to general exploration problems with potential to dramatically benefit the industry.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["NICTA", "NICTA", "NICTA", "NICTA", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Alistair Reid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reid_0001:Alistair", "Simon Timothy O'Callaghan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Callaghan:Simon_Timothy", "Edwin V.
