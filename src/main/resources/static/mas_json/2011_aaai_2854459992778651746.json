For a well-motivated choice of loss function, we show performing this optimization is tractable. In fact, it corresponds to a recently proposed method for dimensionality reduction. We prove this optimization is guaranteed to produce admissible and consistent heuristics, generalizes and gives insight into differential heuristics, and show experimentally that it produces strong heuristics on problems from three distinct search domains.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Denver", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Peking University", "HTC", "Peking University", "HTC", "Auburn University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["D.
