However, the evolution of cloud computing (particularly for data analytics) has greatly benefited from application-independent methods for scaling and placement that achieve high efficiency while relieving programmers of these burdens. NFV has no such general management solutions. In this paper, we present a scalable and application-agnostic scheduling framework for packet processing, and compare its performance to current approaches.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Intel", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Shoumik Palkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palkar:Shoumik", "Chang Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Chang", "Sangjin Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Sangjin", "Keon Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:Keon", "Aurojit Panda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panda:Aurojit", "Sylvia Ratnasamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ratnasamy:Sylvia", "Luigi Rizzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rizzo:Luigi", "Scott Shenker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shenker:Scott"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2015", "pages": 16}
