But users unfamiliar with either the details of SPARQL or properties of the target dataset may find it easier to query by example -- give examples of the information they want (or examples of both what they want and what they do not want) and let the system reverse engineer the desired query from the examples. This approach has been heavily used in the setting of relational databases. We provide here an investigation of the reverse engineering problem in the context of SPARQL. We first provide a theoretical study, formalising variants of the reverse engineering problem and giving tight bounds on its complexity. We next explain an implementation of a reverse engineering tool for positive examples. An experimental analysis of the tool shows that it scales well in the data size, number of examples, and in the size of the smallest query that fits the data. We also give evidence that reverse engineering tools can provide benefits on real-life datasets.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Pontifical Catholic University of Chile", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Marcelo Arenas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arenas:Marcelo", "Gonzalo I.
