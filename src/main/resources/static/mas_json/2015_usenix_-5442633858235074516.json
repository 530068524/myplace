CDStore builds on an augmented secret-sharing scheme called convergent dispersal, which supports deduplication by using deterministic, content-derived hashes as input to secret sharing. CDStore's design is presented here, with an emphasis on how it combines convergent dispersal with two-stage deduplication to achieve both bandwidth and storage savings while robustly diverting side-channel attacks (launched by malicious users on the client side). A cost analysis shows that CDStore yields significant savings over baseline cloud storage solutions.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Mingqiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mingqiang", "Chuan Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Chuan", "Patrick P.
