{"title": "Guarded Computational Type Theory.", "fields": ["recursion", "predicative expression", "dependent type", "operational semantics", "metalanguage"], "abstract": "Nakano's later modality can be used to specify and define recursive functions which are causal or synchronous; in concert with a notion of clock variable, it is possible to also capture the broader class of productive (co)programs. Until now, it has been difficult to combine these constructs with dependent types in a way that preserves the operational meaning of type theory and admits a hierarchy of universes Ui.   We present an operational account of guarded dependent type theory with clocks called CTT, featuring a novel clock intersection connective {k \u00f7 clk} \u2192 A that enjoys the clock irrelevance principle, as well as a predicative hierarchy of universes Ui which does not require any indexing in clock contexts. CTT is simultaneously a programming language with a rich specification logic, as well as a computational metalanguage that can be used to develop semantics of other languages and logics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Jonathan Sterling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sterling:Jonathan", "Robert Harper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harper_0001:Robert"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
