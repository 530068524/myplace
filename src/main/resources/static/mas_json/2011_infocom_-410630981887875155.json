{"title": "Pay bursts only once holds for (some) non-FIFO systems.", "fields": ["network calculus", "packet switching", "phenomenon", "fifo", "concatenation"], "abstract": "Non-FIFO processing of flows by network nodes is not a rare phenomenon. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art analytical tool for the computation of performance bounds in packet-switched networks, network calculus, cannot deal well with non-FIFO systems. The problem lies in its conventional service curve definitions. Either the definition is too strict to allow for a concatenation and consequent beneficial end-to-end analysis, or it is too loose and results in infinite delay bounds. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new service curve definition and demonstrate its strength with respect to achieving both finite delay bounds and a concatenation of systems resulting in a favorable end-to-end delay analysis. In particular, we show that the celebrated pay bursts only once phenomenon is retained even without any assumptions on the processing order of packets. This seems to contradict previous work [15]; the reasons for this are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology"], "authors": ["Jens B.
