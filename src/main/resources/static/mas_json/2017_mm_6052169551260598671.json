Developing a practical deep learning system is arduous and complex. It involves labor-intensive tasks for constructing sophisticated neural networks, coordinating multiple network models, and managing a large amount of training-related data. To facilitate such a development process, we propose TensorLayer which is a Python-based versatile deep learning library. TensorLayer provides high-level modules that abstract sophisticated operations towards neuron layers, network models, training data and dependent training jobs. In spite of offering simplicity, it has transparent module interfaces that allows developers to flexibly embed low-level controls within a backend engine, with the aim of supporting fine-grain tuning towards training. Real-world cluster experiment results show that TensorLayeris able to achieve competitive performance and scalability in critical deep learning tasks. TensorLayer was released in September 2016 on GitHub. Since after, it soon become one of the most popular open-sourced deep learning library used by researchers and practitioners.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Hao Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0003:Hao", "Akara Supratak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Supratak:Akara", "Luo Mai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mai:Luo", "Fangde Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Fangde", "Axel Oehmichen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oehmichen:Axel", "Simiao Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Simiao", "Yike Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yike"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
