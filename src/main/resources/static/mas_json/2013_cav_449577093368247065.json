Logical abduction is the problem of finding a simple explanatory hypothesis that explains observed facts. Specifically, given a set of premises \u0393 and a desired conclusion \u03d5, abductive inference finds a simple explanation \u03a8 such that \u0393 \u039b \u03a8 \u22a2 \u03d5, and \u03a8 is consistent with known premises \u0393. Abduction has many useful applications in verification, including inference of missing preconditions, error diagnosis, and construction of compositional proofs. This paper gives a brief tutorial introduction to EXPLAIN and describes the basic inference algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Isil Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Isil", "Thomas Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Thomas"], "pages": 6}
