More specifically, we design a sample optimal and computationally efficient algorithm for testing the equivalence of two unknown (potentially arbitrary) university distributions under the Ak-distance metric: Given sample access to distributions with density functions p, q: I a#x2192; R, we want to distinguish between the cases that p=q and |p-q| Ak a#x2265; a#x03B5; with probability at least 2/3. We show that for any k a#x2265;2, >0, the optimal sample complexity of the Ak-closeness testing problem is a#x0398;(max{k4/5/a#x0398;6/5, k1/2/a#x0398;2). This is the first o(k) sample algorithm for this problem, and yields new, simple L1 closeness testers, in most cases with optimal sample complexity, for broad classes of structured distributions.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of Edinburgh", "School of Informatics"], "authors": ["Ilias Diakonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakonikolas:Ilias", "Daniel M.
