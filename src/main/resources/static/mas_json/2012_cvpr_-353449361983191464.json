We introduce local palettes for patches, global palettes for entire images and universal palettes for image collections. Using a learned shapelet library, patches from a test image can be analyzed using a variational technique to produce an image descriptor that represents local shapes and colors separately. We show that the shapelet model performs better than SIFT, Gist and the standard stel method on Caltech28 and is very competitive with other methods on Caltech101.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Harvard University", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jeroen Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Jeroen", "Inmar E.
