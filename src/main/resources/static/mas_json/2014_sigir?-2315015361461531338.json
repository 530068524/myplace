Local experts -- in contrast to general topic experts -- have specialized knowledge focused around a particular location, and are important for many applications including answering local information needs and interacting with community experts. And yet identifying these experts is difficult. Hence in this paper, we propose a geo-spatial-driven approach for identifying local experts that leverages the fine-grained GPS coordinates of millions of Twitter users. We propose a local expertise framework that integrates both users' topical expertise and their local authority. Concretely, we estimate a user's local authority via a novel spatial proximity expertise approach that leverages over 15 million geo-tagged Twitter lists. We estimate a user's topical expertise based on expertise propagation over 600 million geo-tagged social connections on Twitter. We evaluate the proposed approach across 56 queries coupled with over 11,000 individual judgments from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We find significant improvement over both general (non-local) expert approaches and comparable local expert finding approaches.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Zhiyuan Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Zhiyuan", "James Caverlee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caverlee:James", "Himanshu Barthwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthwal:Himanshu", "Vandana Bachani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachani:Vandana"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
