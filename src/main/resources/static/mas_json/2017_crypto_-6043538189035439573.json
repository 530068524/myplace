However, the concrete degrees of multilinear maps used in their constructions exceed 30. In this work, we reduce the degree of multilinear maps needed to 5, by giving a new construction of IO from asymmetric L-linear maps and a pseudo-random generator (PRG) with output locality L and polynomial stretch. When plugging in a candidate PRG with locality-5 (e.g., [Goldreich, ECCC 2010, Mossel, Shpilka, and Trevisan, FOCS 2013, O\u2019Donnald and Wither, CCC 2014]), we obtain a construction of IO from 5-linear maps.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Huijia Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Huijia"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 31}
