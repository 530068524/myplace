We observe that, in scenarios where spatial reuse is possible (e.g., in high-density WLAN environments), the classic notion of time-based proportional fairness can be severely impacted: some users might experience very large interference penalties while other users might get larger bandwidth pro- portions than what they would have received with time-based proportional fairness and no spatial reuse. To account for this, we introduce the concept of interference-aware STDMA time- based proportional fairness (i-STPF), and compare it to ordinary STDMA time-based proportional fairness (STPF). We present an \u270fi-STPF scheduling algorithm, and prove that it approximates the time-based fair bandwidth allocation (up to a small positive constant\u270f), while providing an aggregate throughput that is within a constant factor from optimal. We also present a heuristic i-STPF scheduling algorithm and compare it through simulation to a similar heuristic STPF scheduler, and to an interference- aware, rate-based scheduler. The results show that the i-STPF scheduler:i)achieves excellent aggregate throughput about 35% higher than rate-based throughput; andii)maintains a close", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "National Research Council", "National Research Council"], "authors": ["Douglas M.
