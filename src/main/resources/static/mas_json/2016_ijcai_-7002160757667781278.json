{"title": "Normative Practical Reasoning via Argumentation and Dialogue.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "argumentation theory", "normative", "norm", "practical reason"], "abstract": "In a normative environment an agent's actions are not only directed by its goals but also by norms. Here, potential conflicts among the agent's goals and norms makes decision-making challenging. We therefore seek to answer the following questions:(i) how should an agent act in a normative environment? and (ii) how can the agent explain why it acted in a certain way? We propose a solution in which a normative planning problem serves as the basis for a practical reasoning approach based on argumentation. The properties of the best plan(s) w.r.t. goal achievement and norm compliance are mapped to arguments that are used to explain why a plan is justified, using a dialogue game.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Bath", "University of Bath", "University of Aberdeen", "University of Bath"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zohreh Shams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shams:Zohreh", "Marina De Vos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vos:Marina_De", "Nir Oren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oren:Nir", "Julian Padget.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padget:Julian"], "pages": 7}
