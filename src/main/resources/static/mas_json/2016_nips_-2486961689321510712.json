We introduce a new dataset \u201cDepth in the Wild\u201d consisting of images in the wild annotated with relative depth between pairs of random points. We also propose a new algorithm that learns to estimate metric depth using annotations of relative depth. Compared to the state of the art, our algorithm is simpler and performs better. Experiments show that our algorithm, combined with existing RGB-D data and our new relative depth annotations, significantly improves single-image depth perception in the wild.", "citation": "Citations (39)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Robotics Institute"], "authors": ["Weifeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Weifeng", "Zhao Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Zhao", "Dawei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Dawei", "Jia Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Jia"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
