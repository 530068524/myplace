One key challenge in this setting is that learning a good model of coordination can be difficult, since coordination is often implicit in the demonstrations and must be inferred as a latent variable. We propose a joint approach that simultaneously learns a latent coordination model along\nwith the individual policies. In particular, our method integrates unsupervised structure learning with conventional imitation learning. We illustrate\nthe power of our approach on a difficult problem of learning multiple policies for fine-grained behavior modeling in team sports, where different players occupy different roles in the coordinated team strategy. We show that having a coordination model to infer the roles of players yields substantially improved imitation loss compared to conventional baselines.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "University of Minnesota", "Disney Research"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Hoang Minh Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le_0002:Hoang_Minh", "Yisong Yue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yue:Yisong", "Peter Carr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carr_0001:Peter", "Patrick Lucey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucey:Patrick"], "pages": 9}
