Specifically, we define a family of rollout algorithms, in which the rollout policy is restricted to select successor nodes only from a subset of the children list. We show that any rollout policy in this family (either deterministic or randomized) is guaranteed to evaluate the game tree correctly with a finite number of rollouts. Moreover, we identify simple rollout policies in this family that \"implement\" \u03b1-\u03b2 and MT-SSS*. Specifically, given any game tree, the rollout algorithms with these particular policies always visit the same set of leaf nodes in the same order with \u03b1-\u03b2 and MT-SSS*, respectively. Our results suggest that traditional pruning techniques and the recent Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms, as two competing approaches for game tree evaluation, may be unified under the rollout paradigm.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "authors": ["Bojun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Bojun"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
