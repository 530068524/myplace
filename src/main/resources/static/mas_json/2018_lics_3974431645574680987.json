{"title": "An Asynchronous Soundness Theorem for Concurrent Separation Logic.", "fields": ["separation logic", "soundness", "game semantics", "canonical map", "stateless protocol"], "abstract": "Concurrent separation logic (CSL) is a specification logic for concurrent imperative programs with shared memory and locks. In this paper, we develop a concurrent and interactive account of the logic inspired by asynchronous game semantics. To every program C, we associate a pair of asynchronous transition systems [C]S and [C]L which describe the operational behavior of the Code when confronted to its Environment or Frame --- both at the level of machine states (S) and of machine instructions and locks (L). We then establish that every derivation tree \u03c0 of a judgment \u0393 v {P}C{Q} defines a winning and asynchronous strategy [\u03c0]Sep with respect to both asynchronous semantics [C]S and [C]L. From this, we deduce an asynchronous soundness theorem for CSL, which states that the canonical map l: [C]S~[C]L, from the stateful semantics [C]S to the stateless semantics [C]L satisfies a basic fibrational property. We advocate that this provides a clean and conceptual explanation for the usual soundness theorem of CSL, including the absence of data races.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Paris Diderot University", "Paris Diderot University"], "authors": ["Paul-Andr\u00e9 Melli\u00e8s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melli=egrave=s:Paul=Andr=eacute=", "L\u00e9o Stefanesco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefanesco:L=eacute=o"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
