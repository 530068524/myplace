Ubiquitous computing technology offers advantages in augmenting the decision-making process, and the potential to simultaneously encourage sustainable behaviors. In this study we present an empirical analysis of the contents of 11 home wardrobes and 3-6 months of daily dressing decisions for 5 users. We find that an average of only 7% of our female participants' wardrobes and 47% of our male participants' wardrobes are in regular use. In addition, we present an analysis of wardrobe contents, outfit composition, and garment utility in the wardrobe.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Lucy E.
