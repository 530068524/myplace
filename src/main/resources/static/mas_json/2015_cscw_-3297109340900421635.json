{"title": "Avoiding the South Side and the Suburbs: The Geography of Mobile Crowdsourcing Markets.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "volunteered geographic information", "sharing economy", "metropolitan area", "situated"], "abstract": "Mobile crowdsourcing markets (e.g., Gigwalk and TaskRabbit) offer crowdworkers tasks situated in the physical world (e.g., checking street signs, running household errands). The geographic nature of these tasks distinguishes these markets from online crowdsourcing markets and raises new, fundamental questions. We carried out a controlled study in the Chicago metropolitan area aimed at addressing two key questions: (1) What geographic factors influence whether a crowdworker will be willing to do a task? (2) What geographic factors influence how much compensation a crowdworker will demand in order to do a task? Quantitative modeling shows that travel distance to the location of the task and the socioeconomic status (SES) of the task area are important factors. Qualitative analysis enriches our modeling, with workers mentioning safety and difficulties getting to a location as key considerations. Our results suggest that low-SES areas are currently less able to take advantage of the benefits of mobile crowdsourcing markets. We discuss the implications of our study for these markets, as well as for \"sharing economy\" phenomena like UberX, which have many properties in common with mobile crowdsourcing markets.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Jacob Thebault-Spieker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thebault=Spieker:Jacob", "Loren G.
