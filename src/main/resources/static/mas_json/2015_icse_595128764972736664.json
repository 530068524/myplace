{"title": "Presence-Condition Simplification in Highly Configurable Systems.", "fields": ["data structure", "boolean function", "mobile device", "cryptography", "algorithm design"], "abstract": "For the analysis of highly configurable systems, analysis approaches need to take the inherent variability of these systems into account. The notion of presence conditions is central to such approaches. A  presence condition  specifies a subset of system configurations in which a certain artifact or a concern of interest is present (e.g., a defect associated with this subset). In this paper, we introduce and analyze the problem of  presence-condition simplification.  A key observation is that presence conditions often contain redundant information, which can be safely removed in the interest of simplicity and efficiency. We present a formalization of the problem, discuss application scenarios, compare different algorithms for solving the problem, and empirically evaluate the algorithms by means of a set of substantial case studies.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau"], "authors": ["Alexander von Rhein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhein:Alexander_von", "Alexander Grebhahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grebhahn:Alexander", "Sven Apel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apel:Sven", "Norbert Siegmund.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siegmund:Norbert", "Dirk Beyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beyer_0001:Dirk", "Thorsten Berger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berger:Thorsten"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
