{"title": "EnBlogue: emergent topic detection in web 2.0 streams.", "fields": ["world wide web", "personalization", "streams", "analogy", "web 2 0"], "abstract": "Emergent topics are newly arising themes in news, blogs, or tweets, often implied by interesting and unexpected correlations of tags or entities. We present the enBlogue system for emergent topic detection. The name enBlogue reflects the analogy with emerging trends in fashion often referred to as en Vogue. EnBlogue continuously monitors Web 2.0 streams and keeps track of sudden changes in tag correlations which can be adjusted using personalization to reflect particular user interests. We demonstrate enBlogue with several real-time monitoring scenarios as well as with time lapse on archived data.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Foteini Alvanaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alvanaki:Foteini", "Sebastian Michel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michel_0001:Sebastian", "Krithi Ramamritham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramamritham:Krithi", "Gerhard Weikum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weikum:Gerhard"], "pages": 4}
