Whereas many tools for automated development of QFRs have been proposed for relational datasets, QURSED- to the best of our knowledge, is the first tool that facilitates development of web-based QFRs over XML data. The QURSED system is available online at http://db.cse.buffalo.edu/qursed.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Abhijith Kashyap.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kashyap:Abhijith", "Michalis Petropoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petropoulos:Michalis"], "pages": 4}
