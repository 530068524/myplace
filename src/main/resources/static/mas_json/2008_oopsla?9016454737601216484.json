Recent work has highlighted important memory model issues regarding TM semantics and exposed problems in existing TM implementations. For safe, managed languages such as Java, there is a growing consensus towards strong atomicity semantics as a sound, scalable solution. Strong atomicity has presented a challenge to implement efficiently because it requires instrumentation of non-transactional memory accesses, incurring significant overhead even when a program makes minimal or no use of transactions. To minimize overhead, existing solutions require either a sophisticated type system, specialized hardware, or static whole-program analysis. These techniques do not translate easily into a production setting on existing hardware. In this paper, we present novel dynamic optimizations that significantly reduce strong atomicity overheads and make strong atomicity practical for dynamic language environments. We introduce analyses that optimistically track which non-transactional memory accesses can avoid strong atomicity instrumentation, and we describe a lightweight speculation and recovery mechanism that applies these analyses to generate speculatively-optimized but safe code for strong atomicity in a dynamically-loaded environment. We show how to implement these mechanisms efficiently by leveraging existing dynamic optimization infrastructure in a Java system. Measurements on a set of transactional and non-transactional Java workloads demonstrate that our techniques substantially reduce the overhead of strong atomicity from a factor of 5x down to 10% or less over an efficient weak atomicity baseline.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Google", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Florian T.
