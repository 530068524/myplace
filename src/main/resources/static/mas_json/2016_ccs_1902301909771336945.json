These works show how to design protocols for  secure computation with penalties  that tolerate an arbitrary number of corruptions.   In this work, we improve the efficiency of protocols for secure computation with penalties in a hybrid model where parties have access to the \"claim-or-refund\" transaction functionality. Our first improvement is for the ladder protocol of Bentov and Kumaresan (Crypto 2014) where we improve the dependence of the script complexity of the protocol (which corresponds to miner verification load and also space on the blockchain) on the number of parties from quadratic to linear (and in particular, is completely independent of the underlying function). Our second improvement is for the see-saw protocol of Kumaresan et al. (CCS 2015) where we reduce the total number of claim-or-refund transactions and also the script complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of parties.   We also present a 'dual-mode' protocol that offers different guarantees depending on the number of corrupt parties: (1) when s  n/2 parties are corrupt, this protocol guarantees fairness with penalties (i.e., if the adversary gets the output, then either the honest parties get output as well or they get compensation via penalizing the adversary).
