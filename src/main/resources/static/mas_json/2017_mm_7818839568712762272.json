{"title": "QUETRA: A Queuing Theory Approach to DASH Rate Adaptation.", "fields": ["dash", "download", "quality of experience", "dynamic adaptive streaming over http", "occupancy"], "abstract": "DASH, or Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, relies on a rate adaptation component to decide on which representation to download for each video segment. A plethora of rate adaptation algorithms has been proposed in recent years. The decisions of which bitrate to download made by these algorithms largely depend on several factors: estimated network throughput, buffer occupancy, and buffer capacity. Yet, these algorithms are not informed by a fundamental relationship between these factors and the chosen bitrate, and as a result, we found that they do not perform consistently in all scenarios, and require parameter tuning to work well under different buffer capacity. In this paper, we model a DASH client as an  M / D /1/ K  queue, which allows us to calculate the expected buffer occupancy given a bitrate choice, network throughput, and buffer capacity. Using this model, we propose QUETRA, a simple rate adaptation algorithm. We evaluated QUETRA under a diverse set of scenarios and found that, despite its simplicity, it leads to better quality of experience (7% - 140%) than existing algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Praveen Kumar Yadav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yadav:Praveen_Kumar", "Arash Shafiei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shafiei_0001:Arash", "Wei Tsang Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Wei_Tsang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
