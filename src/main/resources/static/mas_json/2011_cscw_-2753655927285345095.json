We describe the process of sketching-driven-co-exploration with therapists and senior citizens leading to our ongoing work in MyReDiary: a personal device for the senior citizens. While supporting self-monitoring of the rehab process for the senior citizens, it simultaneously acts as a tool for collaboration. Importantly, it aims to provide a language for the senior citizens to discuss their experiences from home.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Naveen Bagalkot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagalkot:Naveen", "Tomas Sokoler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sokoler:Tomas"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
