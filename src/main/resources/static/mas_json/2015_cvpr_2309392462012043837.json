Various previous works have advocated the equivalence between stimulus saliency and uncompressibility. We propose a direct measure of this quantity, namely the number of bits required by an optimal video compressor to encode a given video patch, and show that features derived from this measure are highly predictive of eye fixations. To account for global saliency effects, these are embedded in a Markov random field model. The resulting saliency measure is shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for the prediction of fixations, at a very low computational cost. Since most modern cameras incorporate video encoders, this paves the way for in-camera saliency estimation, which could be useful in a variety of computer vision applications.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "University of California, San Diego", "Simon Fraser University", "Cisco Systems, Inc."], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sayed Hossein Khatoonabadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khatoonabadi:Sayed_Hossein", "Nuno Vasconcelos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasconcelos:Nuno", "Ivan V.
