We propose that inherent stochasticity enables synaptic plasticity to carry out probabilistic inference by sampling from a posterior distribution of synaptic parameters. This view provides a viable alternative to existing models that propose convergence of synaptic weights to maximum likelihood parameters. It explains how priors on weight distributions and connection probabilities can be merged optimally with learned experience. In simulations we show that our model for synaptic plasticity allows spiking neural networks to compensate continuously for unforeseen disturbances. Furthermore it provides a normative mathematical framework to better understand the permanent variability and rewiring observed in brain networks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["David Kappel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kappel:David", "Stefan Habenschuss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habenschuss:Stefan", "Robert A.
