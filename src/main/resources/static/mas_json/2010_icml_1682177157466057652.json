{"title": "Exploiting Data-Independence for Fast Belief-Propagation.", "fields": ["latent variable", "data independence", "pairwise comparison", "maximum a posteriori estimation", "belief propagation"], "abstract": "Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference in graphical models requires that we maximize the sum of two terms: a data-dependent term, encoding the conditional likelihood of a certain labeling given an observation, and a data-independent term, encoding some prior on labelings. Often, data-dependent factors contain fewer latent variables than data-independent factors - for instance, many grid and tree-structured models contain only first-order conditionals despite having pairwise priors. In this paper, we note that MAP-inference in such models can be made substantially faster by appropriately preprocessing their data-independent terms. Our main result is to show that message-passing in any such pairwise model has an expected-case exponent of only 1.5 on the number of states per node, leading to significant improvements over existing quadratic-time solutions.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Julian John McAuley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McAuley:Julian_John", "Tib\u00e9rio S.
