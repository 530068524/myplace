It is expected that the rendezvous can be achieved within a short finite time for delay-sensitive applications and over all available channels to increase the robustness to unstable channels. Some existing works suffer from a small number of rendezvous channels and can only guarantee rendezvous under the undesired requirements such as synchronous clock, homogeneous available channels, predetermined roles and explicit SUs' identifiers (IDs). In this paper, to address these limitations, we employ the notion of Disjoint Set Cover (DSC) and propose a DSC-based Rendezvous (DSCR) algorithm. We first present an approximation algorithm to construct one DSC. The variant permutations of elements in the ingeniously constructed DSC are then utilized to regulate the order of accessing channels, enabling SUs to rendezvous on all available channels within a short duration. We derive the theoretical maximum and expected rendezvous latency and prove the full rendezvous degree of the DSCR algorithm. Extensive simulations show that the DSCR algorithm can significantly reduce the rendezvous latency compared to existing algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Bo Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Bo", "Meng Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Meng", "Wei Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang_0001:Wei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
