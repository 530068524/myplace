Elliptical distribution family includes many well-known multivariate distributions like multivariate Gaussian, t and logistic and it is extended to the meta-elliptical by Fang et.al (2002) using the copula techniques. In this paper we extend the meta-elliptical distribution family to a even larger family, called transelliptical. We prove that TCA can obtain a near-optimal s\u221alog d/n estimation consistency rate in recovering the leading eigenvector of the latent generalized correlation matrix under the transelliptical distribution family, even if the distributions are very heavy-tailed, have infinite second moments, do not have densities and possess arbitrarily continuous marginal distributions. A feature selection result with explicit rate is also provided. TCA is further implemented in both numerical simulations and large-scale stock data to illustrate its empirical usefulness. Both theories and experiments confirm that TCA can achieve model flexibility, estimation accuracy and robustness at almost no cost.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Fang Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Fang", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Han"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
