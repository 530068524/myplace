We employ a VP-tree and explore two simple yet effective learning-to-prune approaches: density estimation through sampling and \"stretching\" of the triangle inequality. Both methods are evaluated using data sets with metric (Euclidean) and non-metric (KL-divergence and Itakura-Saito) distance functions. Conditions on spaces where the VP-tree is applicable are discussed. The VP-tree with a learned pruner is compared against the recently proposed state-of-the-art approaches: the bbtree, the multi-probe locality sensitive hashing (LSH), and permutation methods. Our method was competitive against state-of-the-art methods and, in most cases, was more efficient for the same rank approximation quality.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Leonid Boytsov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boytsov:Leonid", "Bilegsaikhan Naidan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naidan:Bilegsaikhan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
