The theorem states that given a set of vectors X in R d , for every vector in the convex hull of X there exists an e-close (under the p-norm distance, for 2 \u2264 p    Using this theorem we establish that in a bimatrix game with n x n payoff matrices A, B, if the number of non-zero entries in any column of A+B is at most s then an e-Nash equilibrium of the game can be computed in time n O(log s/e 2 }) . This, in particular, gives us a polynomial-time approximation scheme for Nash equilibrium in games with fixed column sparsity s. Moreover, for arbitrary bimatrix games---since s can be at most n---the running time of our algorithm matches the best-known upper bound, which was obtained by Lipton, Markakis, and Mehta (2003).   The approximate Caratheodory's theorem also leads to an  additive  approximation algorithm for the densest  k -bipartite subgraph problem. Given a graph with  n  vertices and maximum degree  d , the developed algorithm determines a  k x k  bipartite subgraph with density within e (in the additive sense) of the optimal density in time  n  O (log d/e 2 ).", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Siddharth Barman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barman:Siddharth"], "pages": 9}
