Given a pair of images from a video clip, our framework learns to predict the long-term 3D motions. To reduce the complexity of the learning framework, we propose to describe the motion as a sequence of atomic 3D flows computed with RGB-D modality. We use a Recurrent Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder framework to predict these sequences of flows. We argue that in order for the decoder to reconstruct these sequences, the encoder must learn a robust video representation that captures long-term motion dependencies and spatial-temporal relations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned temporal representations on activity classification across multiple modalities and datasets such as NTU RGB+D and MSR Daily Activity 3D. Our framework is generic to any input modality, i.e., RGB, depth, and RGB-D videos.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zelun Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Zelun", "Boya Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Boya", "De-An Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:De=An", "Alexandre Alahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alahi:Alexandre", "Li Fei-Fei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fei=Fei:Li"], "pages": 10}
