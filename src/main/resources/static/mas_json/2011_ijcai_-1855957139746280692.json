As a consequence we obtain that the network consistency problem for RCC8 can be solved in polynomial time for networks of bounded treewidth.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Manuel Bodirsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodirsky:Manuel", "Stefan W\u00f6lfl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/W=ouml=lfl_0001:Stefan"], "pages": 6}
