The task was to control a virtual robot hand removing a thin foil cover from a satellite in an on-orbit servicing training simulator. The lack of haptic feedback placed a high challenge on the user when trying to apply the right force for grasping the foil without losing grip or damaging it. We compared the intuitiveness and effectiveness of using a tracked joystick, finger distance measurement, and a novel prototype enabling direct force input through pinching.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "Software for Sp ...
