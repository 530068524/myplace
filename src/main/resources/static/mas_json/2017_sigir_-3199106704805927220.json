It is also crucial for automatic text generation. While numerous researchers developed various methods to automatically evaluate the informativeness of the produced contents, the evaluation of readability is usually performed manually. In contrast to that, we present a self-sufficient metric for SO assessment based on text topic-comment structure. We show that this metric has high accuracy.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Lorraine", "University of Toulouse", "Perm State University"], "authors": ["Liana Ermakova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ermakova:Liana", "Josiane Mothe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mothe:Josiane", "Anton Firsov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Firsov:Anton"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
