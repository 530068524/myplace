{"title": "Google+ or Google-?: dissecting the evolution of the new OSN in its first year.", "fields": ["social media", "connected component", "computer science", "world wide web"], "abstract": "In the era when Facebook and Twitter dominate the market for social media, Google has introduced Google+ (G+) and reported a significant growth in its size while others called it a ghost town. This begs the question that \"whether G+ can really attract a significant number of connected and active users despite the dominance of Facebook and Twitter?\".   This paper tackles the above question by presenting a detailed characterization of G+ based on large scale measurements. We identify the main components of G+ structure, characterize the key features of their users and their evolution over time. We then conduct detailed analysis on the evolution of connectivity and activity among users in the largest connected component (LCC) of G+ structure, and compare their characteristics with other major OSNs. We show that despite the dramatic growth in the size of G+, the relative size of LCC has been decreasing and its connectivity has become less clustered. While the aggregate user activity has gradually increased, only a very small fraction of users exhibit any type of activity. To our knowledge, our study offers the most comprehensive characterization of G+ based on the largest collected data sets.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Charles III University of Madrid", "Charles III University of Madrid", "University of Oregon", "University of Oregon", "Telecom Sud Par ... s, Evry, France"], "authors": ["Roberto Gonzalez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonzalez:Roberto", "Rub\u00e9n Cuevas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cuevas:Rub=eacute=n", "Reza Motamedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motamedi:Reza", "Reza Rejaie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rejaie:Reza", "\u00c1ngel Cuevas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cuevas:=Aacute=ngel"], "conf": "www", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
