In this paper we show that the common evaluation for unsupervised dependency parsing is highly sensitive to problematic annotations. We show that for three leading unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set of parameters can be found whose modification yields a significant improvement in standard evaluation measures. These parameters correspond to local cases where no linguistic consensus exists as to the proper gold annotation. Therefore, the standard evaluation does not provide a true indication of algorithm quality. We present a new measure, Neutral Edge Direction (NED), and show that it greatly reduces this undesired phenomenon.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Roy Schwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwartz:Roy", "Omri Abend.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abend:Omri", "Roi Reichart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reichart:Roi", "Ari Rappoport.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rappoport:Ari"], "pages": 10}
