We recently presented DataXFormer, a system that leverages Web tables, Web forms, and expert sourcing to cover a wide range of transformations. In this demonstration, we present the user-interaction with DataXFormer and show scenarios on how it can be used to transform data and explore the effectiveness and efficiency of several approaches for transformation discovery, leveraging about 112 million tables and online sources.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Waterloo", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["John Morcos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morcos:John", "Ziawasch Abedjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abedjan:Ziawasch", "Ihab Francis Ilyas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilyas:Ihab_Francis", "Mourad Ouzzani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouzzani:Mourad", "Paolo Papotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papotti:Paolo", "Michael Stonebraker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stonebraker:Michael"], "pages": 6}
