A key challenge is to achieve a good load balancing algorithm for storage and processing of these data, which is done by partitioning the database. We introduce the concept of  optimal splitters  for temporal and multi-version databases, which induce a partition of the input data set, and guarantee that the size of the maximum bucket be minimized among all possible configurations, given a budget for the desired number of buckets. We design efficient methods for memory- and disk resident data respectively, and show that they significantly outperform competing baseline methods both theoretically and empirically on large real data sets.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "KAIST", "University of Utah"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Wangchao Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Wangchao", "Feifei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Feifei", "Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei", "Robert Christensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christensen:Robert"], "pages": 12}
