{"title": "Eliminating Disjunctions in Answer Set Programming by Restricted Unfolding.", "fields": ["rewriting", "answer set programming", "anytime algorithm", "semantics", "stable model semantics"], "abstract": "A disjunctive logic program under the answer set semantics can be equivalently translated to a normal logic program by the shifting transformation, if the program is head-cycle-free. In this paper, we provide an answer-set-preserving rewriting of a general disjunctive program to a normal program by first applying the unfolding transformation on atoms that prevent the program from being head-cycle-free, then shifting the resulting program. Different from other transformations that eliminate disjunctions in answer set programming, the new rewriting is efficient for \"almost\" head-cycle-free programs, i.e., programs that have only a few atoms that prevent them to be head-cycle-free. Based on the new rewriting, we provide an anytime algorithm to compute answer sets of a disjunctive program by calling solvers for normal logic programs. The experiment shows that the algorithm is efficient for some disjunctive programs. We also extend the rewriting to non-ground answer set programs on finite structures.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Griffith University", "Griffith University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jianmin Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Jianmin", "Hai Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Hai", "Kewen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kewen", "Zhe Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Zhe", "Chuhan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chuhan", "Jiangtao Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jiangtao"], "pages": 8}
