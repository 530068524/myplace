{"title": "Exploring Co-presence for Next Generation Technical Support.", "fields": ["server", "human multitasking", "technical support", "augmented reality", "modalities"], "abstract": "In many technical support systems, live support agents help end-users resolve issues with computer software/hardware and appliances/gadgets in the real world. The dominant mode of communication in such systems is still the telephone, while instant messaging, video communication, and remote take-over have emerged as additional modalities in recent years. In contrast to these, 3D avatar based visual co-presence offers a unique combination of gestural interaction, shared reality, agent multitasking, and anonymity. Our paper argues that such 3D co-presence is viable in computer chat/remote help sessions, as well as real world support over camera equipped devices, offering an attractive alternative and enhancement to today's support modalities.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Sinem G\u00fcven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=uuml=ven:Sinem", "Mark Podlaseck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podlaseck:Mark", "Gopal Sarma Pingali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pingali:Gopal_Sarma"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
