{"title": "A Generative Model for Depth-Based Robust 3D Facial Pose Tracking.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "pose", "discriminative model", "generative model", "point cloud"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of depth-based robust 3D facial pose tracking under unconstrained scenarios with heavy occlusions and arbitrary facial expression variations. Unlike the previous depth-based discriminative or data-driven methods that require sophisticated training or manual intervention, we propose a generative framework that unifies pose tracking and face model adaptation on-the-fly. Particularly, we propose a statistical 3D face model that owns the flexibility to generate and predict the distribution and uncertainty underlying the face model. Moreover, unlike prior arts employing the ICP-based facial pose estimation, we propose a ray visibility constraint that regularizes the pose based on the face models visibility against the input point cloud, which augments the robustness against the occlusions. The experimental results on Biwi and ICT-3DHP datasets reveal that the proposed framework is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art depth-based methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Rutgers University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Lu Sheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheng:Lu", "Jianfei Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Jianfei", "Tat-Jen Cham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cham:Tat=Jen", "Vladimir Pavlovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pavlovic:Vladimir", "King Ngi Ngan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ngan:King_Ngi"], "pages": 10}
