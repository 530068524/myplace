Before standardizing the memory model interface for GPUs, it is imperative that we understand the tradeoffs of different memory models for these devices. While there is a rich memory model literature for CPUs, studies on architectural mechanisms and performance costs for enforcing memory ordering constraints in GPU accelerators have been lacking.   This paper shows that the performance cost of SC and TSO compared to DRF-0 is insignificant for most GPGPU applications, due to warp-level parallelism and in-order execution. For the remaining challenging applications that exhibit significant overhead for SC, we show that commonly employed memory ordering optimizations in CPUs are either expensive or in effective for GPUs. We propose a GPU-specific non-speculative SC design that takes advantage of high spatial locality and temporally private data in GPU applications. Results show that the proposed design is effective in eliminating the performance gap between SC and DRF-0 in GPUs.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Abhayendra Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Abhayendra", "Shaizeen Aga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aga:Shaizeen", "Satish Narayanasamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanasamy:Satish"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2015", "pages": 14}
