In this paper we explore its application to the game of Kriegspiel (invisible chess), providing three Monte Carlo methods of increasing strength for playing the game with little specific knowledge. We compare these Monte Carlo agents to the strongest known minimax-based Kriegspiel player, obtaining significantly better results with a considerably simpler logic and less domain-specific knowledge.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "University of Bologna"], "authors": ["Paolo Ciancarini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciancarini:Paolo", "Gian Piero Favini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Favini:Gian_Piero"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
