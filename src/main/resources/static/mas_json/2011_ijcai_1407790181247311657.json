{"title": "A Cognitive Agent Model Displaying and Regulating Different Social Response Patterns.", "fields": ["cognition", "mirror neuron", "autism", "cognitive psychology", "empathy"], "abstract": "Differences in social responses of individuals can often be related to differences in functioning of neurological mechanisms. This paper presents a cognitive agent model capable of showing different types of social response patterns based on such mechanisms, adopted from theories on mirror neuron systems, emotion regulation, empathy, and autism spectrum disorders. The presented agent model provides a basis for human-like social response patterns of virtual agents in the context of simulation-based training (e.g., for training of therapists), gaming, or for agent-based generation of virtual stories.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["VU University Amsterdam"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jan Treur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Treur:Jan"], "pages": 8}
