{"title": "A Translation-Based Approach to Contingent Planning.", "fields": ["bounded function", "state space", "planner", "nondeterministic algorithm", "search problem"], "abstract": "The problem of planning in the presence of sensing has been addressed in recent years as a nondeterministic search problem in belief space. In this work, we use ideas advanced recently for compiling conformant problems into classical ones for introducing a different approach where contingent problems P are mapped into non-deterministic problems X(P) in state space. We also identify a contingent width parameter, and show that for problems P with bounded contingent width, the translation is sound, polynomial, and complete. We then solve X(P) by using a relaxation X+(P) that is a classical planning problem. The formulation is tested experimentally over contingent benchmarks where it is shown to yield a planner that scales up better than existing contingent planners.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "departments": ["Pompeu Fabra University", "Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University", "Pompeu Fabra University"], "authors": ["Alexandre Albore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albore:Alexandre", "H\u00e9ctor Palacios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palacios:H=eacute=ctor", "Hector Geffner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geffner:Hector"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
