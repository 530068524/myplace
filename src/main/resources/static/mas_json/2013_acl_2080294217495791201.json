{"title": "Learning to lemmatise Polish noun phrases.", "fields": ["specifier", "nominalization", "noun phrase", "lemmatisation", "chunking"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to noun phrase lemmatisation where the main phase is cast as a tagging problem. The idea draws on the observation that the lemmatisation of almost all Polish noun phrases may be decomposed into transformation of singular words (tokens) that make up each phrase. We perform evaluation, which shows results similar to those obtained earlier by a rule-based system, while our approach allows to separate chunking from lemmatisation.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Wroc\u0142aw"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Adam Radziszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radziszewski:Adam"], "pages": 9}
