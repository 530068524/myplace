{"title": "Enforcing Structural Regularities in Source Code using IntensiVE.", "fields": ["software architecture", "software design pattern", "documentation", "coding conventions", "software system"], "abstract": "The design and implementation of a software system is often governed by many different coding conventions, design patterns, architectural design rules, and other so-called structural regularities. To prevent a deterioration of the system's source code, it is important that these regularities are verified and enforced in subsequent evolutions of the system. The Intensional Views Environment (IntensiVE), which is the subject of this demonstration, is a tool suite for documenting such structural regularities in (object-oriented) software systems and verifying their consistency in later versions of those systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"], "authors": ["Johan Brichau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brichau:Johan", "Andy Kellens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kellens:Andy", "Kim Mens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mens:Kim"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
