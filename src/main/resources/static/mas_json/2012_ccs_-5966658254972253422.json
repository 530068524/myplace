{"title": "FlowFox: a web browser with flexible and precise information flow control.", "fields": ["client side scripting", "comet", "web based simulation", "web api", "web design"], "abstract": "We present FlowFox, the first fully functional web browser that implements a precise and general information flow control mechanism for web scripts based on the technique of secure multi-execution. We demonstrate how FlowFox subsumes many ad-hoc script containment countermeasures developed over the last years. We also show that FlowFox is compatible with the current web, by investigating its behavior on the Alexa top-500 web sites, many of which make intricate use of JavaScript.   The performance and memory cost of FlowFox is substantial (a performance cost of around 20% on macro benchmarks for a simple two level policy), but not prohibitive. Our prototype implementation shows that information flow enforcement based on secure multi-execution can be implemented in full-scale browsers. It can support powerful, yet precise policies refining the same-origin-policy in a way that is compatible with existing websites.", "citation": "Citations (146)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Willem De Groef.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Groef:Willem_De", "Dominique Devriese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Devriese:Dominique", "Nick Nikiforakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikiforakis:Nick", "Frank Piessens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piessens:Frank"], "pages": 12}
