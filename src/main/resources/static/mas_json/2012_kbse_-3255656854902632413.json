{"title": "Diagnosys: automatic generation of a debugging interface to the Linux kernel.", "fields": ["configfs", "background debug mode interface", "sysfs", "algorithmic program debugging", "procfs"], "abstract": "The Linux kernel does not export a stable, well-defined kernel interface, complicating the development of kernel-level services, such as device drivers and file systems. While there does exist a set of functions that are exported to external modules, this set of functions frequently changes, and the functions have implicit, ill-documented preconditions. No specific debugging support is provided.     We present Diagnosys, an approach to automatically constructing a debugging interface for the Linux kernel. First, a designated kernel maintainer uses Diagnosys to identify constraints on the use of the exported functions. Based on this information, developers of kernel services can then use Diagnosys to generate a debugging interface specialized to their code. When a service including this interface is tested, it records information about potential problems. This information is preserved following a kernel crash or hang. Our experiments show that the generated debugging interface provides useful log information and incurs a low performance penalty.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Tegawend\u00e9 F.
