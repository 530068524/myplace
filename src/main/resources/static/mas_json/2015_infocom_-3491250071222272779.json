To this end there are many systems which have been introduced which allow users to obtain aggregate results by aggregating along communication structures such as trees, but they do not focus on optimizing performance by optimizing the underlying structure to perform the aggregation. We consider two cases of the problem \u2014 aggregation of (1) single blocks of data, and of (2) streaming input. For each case we determine which metric of \u201cfast\u201d completion is the most relevant and mathematically model resulting systems based on aggregation trees to optimize that metric. Our assumptions and model are laid out in depth. From our model we determine how to create a provably ideal aggregation tree (i.e., with optimal fanin) using only limited information about the aggregation function being applied. Experiments in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) confirm the validatity of our models in practice.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "IMDEA", "Google", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["William Culhane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Culhane:William", "Kirill Kogan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kogan:Kirill", "Chamikara Jayalath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jayalath:Chamikara", "Patrick Eugster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eugster:Patrick"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
