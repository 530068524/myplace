{"title": "A Holistic Approach to Cross-Channel Image Noise Modeling and Its Application to Image Denoising.", "fields": ["gradient noise", "image noise", "video denoising", "value noise", "dark frame subtraction"], "abstract": "Modelling and analyzing noise in images is a fundamental task in many computer vision systems. Traditionally, noise has been modelled per color channel assuming that the color channels are independent. Although the color channels can be considered as mutually independent in camera RAW images, signals from different color channels get mixed during the imaging process inside the camera due to gamut mapping, tone-mapping, and compression. We show the influence of the in-camera imaging pipeline on noise and propose a new noise model in the 3D RGB space to accounts for the color channel mix-ups. A data-driven approach for determining the parameters of the new noise model is introduced as well as its application to image denoising. The experiments show that our noise model represents the noise in regular JPEG images more accurately compared to the previous models and is advantageous in image denoising.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Yonsei University", "Osaka University", "Yonsei University", "Korea Electroni ... ology Institute"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Seonghyeon Nam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nam:Seonghyeon", "Youngbae Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Youngbae", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki", "Seon Joo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seon_Joo"], "pages": 9}
