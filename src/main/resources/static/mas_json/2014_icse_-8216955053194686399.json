{"title": "Self-adaptation through incremental generative model transformations at runtime.", "fields": ["model transformation", "decision tree", "throughput", "generative design", "generative model"], "abstract": "A self-adaptive system uses runtime models to adapt its architecture to the changing requirements and contexts. However, there is no one-to-one mapping between the requirements in the problem space and the architectural elements in the solution space. Instead, one refined requirement may crosscut multiple architectural elements, and its realization involves complex behavioral or structural interactions manifested as architectural design decisions. In this paper we propose to combine two kinds of self-adaptations: requirements-driven self-adaptation, which captures requirements as goal models to reason about the best plan within the problem space, and architecture-based self-adaptation, which captures architectural design decisions as decision trees to search for the best design for the desired requirements within the contextualized solution space. Following these adaptations, component-based architecture models are reconfigured using incremental and generative model transformations. Compared with requirements-driven or architecture-based approaches, the case study using an online shopping benchmark shows promise that our approach can further improve the effectiveness of adaptation (e.g. system throughput in this case study) and offer more adaptation flexibility.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Open University", "University of Limerick", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Bihuan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bihuan", "Xin Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Xin", "Yijun Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yijun", "Bashar Nuseibeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nuseibeh:Bashar", "Wenyun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wenyun"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
