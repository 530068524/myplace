{"title": "Estimating the Probability of Meeting a Deadline in Hierarchical Plans.", "fields": ["job shop scheduling", "approximation algorithm", "machine learning", "computation", "sampling"], "abstract": "Given a hierarchical plan (or schedule) with uncertain task times, we may need to determine the probability that a given plan will satisfy a given deadline. This problem is shown to be NP-hard for series-parallel hierarchies. We provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for it. Computing the expected makespan of an hierarchical plan is also shown to be NP-hard. We examine the approximation bounds empirically and demonstrate where our scheme is superior to sampling and to exact computation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Liat Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Liat", "Solomon Eyal Shimony.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimony:Solomon_Eyal", "Gera Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:Gera"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
