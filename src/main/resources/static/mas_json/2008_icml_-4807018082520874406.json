We introduce Object-Oriented MDPs (OO-MDPs), a representation based on objects and their interactions, which is a natural way of modeling environments and offers important generalization opportunities. We introduce a learning algorithm for deterministic OO-MDPs and prove a polynomial bound on its sample complexity. We illustrate the performance gains of our representation and algorithm in the well-known Taxi domain, plus a real-life videogame.", "citation": "Citations (144)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Carlos Diuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diuk:Carlos", "Andre Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Andre", "Michael L.
