Complementation of \u03c9-automata is a crucial instrument in many these applications, and hence there have been great interests in determining the state complexity of the complementation problem. However, obtaining nontrivial lower bounds has been difficult. For the complementation of Rabin automata, a significant gap exists between the state-of-the-art lower bound 2^\u03a9(NlgN) and upper bound 2^O(kNlgN), where k, the number of Rabin pairs, can be as large as 2N. In this paper we introduce multidimensional rankings to the full automata technique. Using the improved technique we establish an almost tight lower bound for the complementation of Rabin automata. We also show that the same lower bound holds for the determinization of Rabin automata.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Iowa State University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Yang Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai_0001:Yang", "Ting Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ting", "Haifeng Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Haifeng"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
