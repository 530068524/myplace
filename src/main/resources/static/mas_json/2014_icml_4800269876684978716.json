{"title": "Latent Bandits.", "fields": ["reward based selection", "pattern recognition", "small number", "regret", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We consider a multi-armed bandit problem where the reward distributions are indexed by two sets -one for arms, one for type- and can be partitioned into a small number of clusters according to the type. First, we consider the setting where all reward distributions are known and all types have the same underlying cluster, the type's identity is, however, unknown. Second, we study the case where types may come from different classes, which is significantly more challenging. Finally, we tackle the case where the reward distributions are completely unknown. In each setting, we introduce specific algorithms and derive non-trivial regret performance. Numerical experiments show that, in the most challenging agnostic case, the proposed algorithm achieves excellent performance in several difficult scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Odalric-Ambrym Maillard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maillard:Odalric=Ambrym", "Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie"], "pages": 9}
