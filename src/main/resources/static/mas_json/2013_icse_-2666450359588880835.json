However, for new projects or projects with limited training data, it is desirable to learn a prediction model by using sufficient training data from existing source projects and then apply the model to some target projects (cross-project defect prediction). Unfortunately, the performance of cross-project defect prediction is generally poor, largely because of feature distribution differences between the source and target projects. In this paper, we apply a state-of-the-art transfer learning approach, TCA, to make feature distributions in source and target projects similar. In addition, we propose a novel transfer defect learning approach, TCA+, by extending TCA. Our experimental results for eight open-source projects show that TCA+ significantly improves cross-project prediction performance.", "citation": "Citations (191)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Inst. for Infoc ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Jaechang Nam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nam:Jaechang", "Sinno Jialin Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Sinno_Jialin", "Sunghun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Sunghun"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
