CCRank is based on cooperative coevolution (CC), a divide-and-conquer framework that has demonstrated high promise in function optimization for problems with large search space and complex structures. Moreover, CC naturally allows parallelization of sub-solutions to the decomposed sub-problems, which can substantially boost learning efficiency. With CCRank, we investigate parallel CC in the context of learning to rank. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms show that CCRank gains in both accuracy and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Texas State University", "Texas State University", "Simon Fraser University", "Institute for I ... rch, Singapore"], "authors": ["Shuaiqiang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shuaiqiang", "Byron J.
