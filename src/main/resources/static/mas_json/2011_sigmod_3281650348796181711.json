Most of existing flash-based buffer management policies adopt disk-oriented strategies by giving a specific priority to dirty pages, while not fully exploiting the characteristics of the flash memory. In this paper, we propose a novel buffer replacement algorithm named FOR, which stands for Flash-based Operation-aware buffer Replacement. The core idea of FOR is based on novel operation-aware page weight determination for buffer replacement. The weight metric not only measures the locality of read/write operations on a page, but also takes the cost difference of read/write operations into account. We further develop an efficient implementation FOR+ with the time complexity of O(1) for each operation. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark traces demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy, which yields better performance compared with some state-of-the-art flash-based buffer management policies.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Peking University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yanfei Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Yanfei", "Bin Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui_0001:Bin", "Bingsheng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Bingsheng", "Xuexuan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xuexuan"], "pages": 12}
