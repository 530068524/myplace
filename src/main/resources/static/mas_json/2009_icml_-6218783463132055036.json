{"title": "Discovering options from example trajectories.", "fields": ["machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "speedup", "scalability", "reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "We present a novel technique for automated problem decomposition to address the problem of scalability in reinforcement learning. Our technique makes use of a set of near-optimal trajectories to discover  options  and incorporates them into the learning process, dramatically reducing the time it takes to solve the underlying problem. We run a series of experiments in two different domains and show that our method offers up to 30 fold speedup over the baseline.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Peng Zang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zang:Peng", "Peng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Peng", "David Minnen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minnen:David", "Charles Lee Isbell Jr......http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isbell_Jr=:Charles_Lee"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
