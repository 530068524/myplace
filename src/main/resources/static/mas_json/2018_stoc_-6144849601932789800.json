{"title": "Inapproximability of the independent set polynomial in the complex plane.", "fields": ["reciprocal polynomial", "real number", "complex plane", "degree", "critical point"], "abstract": "We study the complexity of approximating the value of the independent set polynomial  Z   G  (\u03bb) of a graph  G  with maximum degree \u0394 when the activity \u03bb is a complex number.    When \u03bb is real, the complexity picture is well-understood, and is captured by two real-valued thresholds \u03bb *  and \u03bb  c  , which depend on \u0394 and satisfy 0 *   c  . It is known that if \u03bb is a real number in the interval (\u2212\u03bb * ,\u03bb  c  ) then there is an FPTAS for approximating  Z   G  (\u03bb) on graphs  G  with maximum degree at most \u0394. On the other hand, if \u03bb is a real number outside of the (closed) interval, then approximation is NP-hard. The key to establishing this picture was the interpretation of the thresholds \u03bb *  and \u03bb  c   on the \u0394-regular tree. The \u201doccupation ratio\u201d of a \u0394-regular tree  T  is the contribution to  Z   T  (\u03bb) from independent sets containing the root of the tree, divided by  Z   T  (\u03bb) itself. This occupation ratio converges to a limit, as the height of the tree grows, if and only if \u03bb\u2208 [\u2212\u03bb * ,\u03bb  c  ].    Unsurprisingly, the case where \u03bb is complex is more challenging. It is known that there is an FPTAS when \u03bb is a complex number with norm at most \u03bb *  and also when \u03bb is in a small strip surrounding the real interval [0,\u03bb  c  ). However, neither of these results is believed to fully capture the truth about when approximation is possible. Peters and Regts identified the values of \u03bb for which the occupation ratio of the \u0394-regular tree converges. These values carve a cardioid-shaped region \u039b \u0394  in the complex plane, whose boundary includes the critical points \u2212\u03bb *  and \u03bb  c  . Motivated by the picture in the real case, they asked whether \u039b \u0394  marks the true approximability threshold for general complex values \u03bb.    Our main result shows that for every \u03bb outside of \u039b \u0394 , the problem of approximating  Z   G  (\u03bb) on graphs  G  with maximum degree at most \u0394 is indeed NP-hard. In fact, when \u03bb is outside of \u039b \u0394  and is not a positive real number, we give the stronger result that approximating  Z   G  (\u03bb) is actually #P-hard. Further, on the negative real axis, when \u03bb * , we show that it is #P-hard to even decide whether  Z   G  (\u03bb)>0, resolving in the affirmative a conjecture of Harvey, Srivastava and Vondrak.    Our proof techniques are based around tools from complex analysis \u2014 specifically the study of iterative multivariate rational maps.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Rochester Institute of Technology", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Rochester"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ivona Bez\u00e1kov\u00e1.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bez=aacute=kov=aacute=:Ivona", "Andreas Galanis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galanis:Andreas", "Leslie Ann Goldberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldberg:Leslie_Ann", "Daniel Stefankovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefankovic:Daniel"], "pages": 7}
