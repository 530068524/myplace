By leveraging a LSH style randomized indexing procedure and combining it with several principled techniques, such as reservoir sampling, recent advances in one-pass minwise hashing, and count based estimations, we reduce the computational and parallelization costs of similarity search, while retaining sound theoretical guarantees.   We evaluate FLASH on several real, high-dimensional datasets from different domains, including text, malicious URL, click-through prediction, social networks, etc. Our experiments shed new light on the difficulties associated with datasets having several million dimensions. Current state-of-the-art implementations either fail on the presented scale or are orders of magnitude slower than FLASH. FLASH is capable of computing an approximate k-NN graph, from scratch, over the full webspam dataset (1.3 billion nonzeros) in less than 10 seconds. Computing a full k-NN graph in less than 10 seconds on the webspam dataset, using brute-force (n2D), will require at least 20 teraflops. We provide CPU and GPU implementations of FLASH for replicability of our results.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yiqiu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yiqiu", "Anshumali Shrivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrivastava:Anshumali", "Jonathan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jonathan", "Junghee Ryu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryu:Junghee"], "pages": 15}
