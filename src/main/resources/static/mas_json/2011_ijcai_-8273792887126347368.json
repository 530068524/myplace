{"title": "Constraint Programming on Infinite Data Streams.", "fields": ["data stream mining", "expression", "solution set", "buchi automaton", "sequence"], "abstract": "Classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are commonly defined on finite domains. In real life, constrained variables can evolve over time. A variable can actually take an infinite sequence of values over discrete time points. In this paper, we propose constraint programming on infinite data streams, which provides a natural way to model constrained time-varying problems. In our framework, variable domains are specified by \u03c9-regular languages. We introduce special stream operators as basis to form stream expressions and constraints. Stream CSPs have infinite search space. We propose a search procedure that can recognize and avoid infinite search over duplicate search space. The solution set of a stream CSP can be represented by a Buchi automaton allowing stream values to be non-periodic. Consistency notions are defined to reduce the search space early. We illustrate the feasibility of the framework by examples and experiments.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Caen Lower Normandy", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Arnaud Lallouet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lallouet:Arnaud", "Yat Chiu Law.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Law:Yat_Chiu", "Jimmy Ho-Man Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jimmy_Ho=Man", "Charles F.
