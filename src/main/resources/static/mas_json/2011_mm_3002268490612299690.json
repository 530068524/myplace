Many current pedestrian detection systems limit their performance by ignoring the underlying 3D geometric context in the image. We can estimate the geometric context by learning appearance-based method. We propose a novel context feature and local integrable features. These features are used for building many candidate weak classifiers by using linear SVM. Finally, MPL-Boost method selects the best weak classifiers suited for detection and construct the rejector-based cascade detector. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation of our method on TUD-Brussels dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art pedestrian detector in recall rate, meanwhile, shows faster speed than other context incorporation method.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"], "authors": ["Junqiang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Junqiang", "Huadong Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Huadong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
