Wireless sensor network poses new challenges due to the resource constraints and real-time requirements. Existing work has dealt with the real-time sampling rate assignment problem, under single processor case and network case with static routing environment. For wireless sensor networks, in order to achieve better overall network performance, routing should be considered together with the rate assignments of individual flows. In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing sampling rates with dynamic route selection for wireless sensor networks. We model the problem as a constrained optimization problem and solve it under the network utility maximization framework. Based on the primal-dual method and dual decomposition technique, we design a distributed algorithm that achieves the optimal global network utility considering both dynamic route decision and rate assignment. Extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed solutions.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Weihuan Shu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shu:Weihuan", "Xue Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Xue", "Zonghua Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Zonghua", "Sathish Gopalakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalakrishnan:Sathish"], "pages": 11}
