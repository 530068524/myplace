We propose that the automatic generation of very short  micro-explanations , suitable for real-time delivery in clinical settings, can transform patient care by giving patients greater awareness of key events in their electronic medical record. We present results of a survey study indicating that it may be possible to automatically generate such explanations by extracting individual sentences from consumer-facing Web pages. We further inform future work by characterizing physician and non-physician responses to a variety of Web-extracted explanations of medical lab tests.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "MedStar Institu ... lumbia, WA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Lauren Wilcox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilcox:Lauren", "Dan Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Dan", "Desney S.
