However, most of the previous activity recognition methods do not offer a flexible and scalable scheme to handle the high order context modeling problem. To explicitly address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a recurrent interactional context modeling scheme based on LSTM network. By utilizing the information propagation/aggregation capability of LSTM, the proposed scheme unifies the interactional feature modeling process for single person dynamics, intra-group (e.g., persons within a group) and inter-group(e.g., group to group)interactions. The proposed high order context modeling scheme produces more discriminative/descriptive interactional features. It is very flexible to handle a varying number of input instances (e.g., different number of persons in a group or different number of groups) and linearly scalable to high order context modeling problem. Extensive experiments on two benchmark collective/group activity datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Minsi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Minsi", "Bingbing Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Bingbing", "Xiaokang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiaokang"], "pages": 9}
