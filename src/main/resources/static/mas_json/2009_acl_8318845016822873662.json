Capturing the nature and the number of semantic roles in a sentence is therefore fundamental to correctly describing the interface between grammar and meaning. In this paper, we compare two annotation schemes, Prop-Bank and VerbNet, in a task-independent, general way, analysing how well they fare in capturing the linguistic generalisations that are known to hold for semantic role labels, and consequently how well they grammaticalise aspects of meaning. We show that VerbNet is more verb-specific and better able to generalise to new semantic role instances, while PropBank better captures some of the structural constraints among roles. We conclude that these two resources should be used together, as they are complementary.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Geneva", "University of Geneva"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Paola Merlo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Merlo:Paola", "Lonneke van der Plas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plas:Lonneke_van_der"], "pages": 9}
