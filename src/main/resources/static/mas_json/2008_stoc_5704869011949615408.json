In particular, kd-trees built with cost estimation functions such as a surface area heuristic (SAH) seem to be important for reaching high performance. Unfortunately, most algorithms for building such trees have a time complexity of O(N log 2  N), or even O(N 2 ). In this paper, we analyze the state of the art in building good kd-trees for ray tracing, and eventually propose an algorithm that builds SAH kd-trees in O(N log N), the theoretical lower bound", "citation": "Citations (3,803)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Utah", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "University of Bremen", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Gen.
