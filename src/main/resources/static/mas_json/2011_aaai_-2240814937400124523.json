The measure is based on the spatial overlap of the shapes and densities of these point sets. It is applicable in any domain where point sets are a natural representation for data. Specifically, we show examples of its use in natural language processing, object recognition in images, and multidimensional point set classification. We provide a geometric interpretation of this measure and show that it is well-motivated, intuitive, parameter-free, and straightforward to use. We further demonstrate that it is computationally tractable and applicable to both supervised and unsupervised learning problems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Michael H.
