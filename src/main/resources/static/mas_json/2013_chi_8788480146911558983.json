Since the mouse performs exceptionally well in a desktop setting, previous research on MAGIC pointing either resulted in minor improvements, or the techniques were applied to alternative devices or environments. We design Animated MAGIC, a novel, target-agnostic MAGIC pointing technique, for the specific goal of beating the mouse in a desktop setting. To improve the eye-tracking accuracy, we develop a dynamic local calibration method that uses each selection as a local calibration point. We compare Animated MAGIC to mouse-only and Conservative MAGIC, one of the two original MAGIC pointing methods, in a Fitts' Law experiment. We conduct a user questionnaire to evaluate the usability of the interaction methods. Results suggest that Dynamic Local Calibration improves eye-tracking accuracy and, consequently, MAGIC pointing performance. Powered with Dynamic Local Calibration, Animated MAGIC outperformed mouse-only by 8% in terms of throughput. Both MAGIC pointing methods reduced the amount of hand movement by more than half.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Texas State University", "Texas State University", "Texas State University"], "authors": ["Ribel Fares.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fares:Ribel", "Shaomin Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Shaomin", "Oleg Komogortsev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komogortsev:Oleg"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
