Inspired by the great success of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) in AI, researchers have tried to apply it to improve the performance of RGB-D object recognition. However, DCNN always requires a large-scale annotated dataset to supervise its training. Manually labeling such a large RGB-D dataset is expensive and time consuming, which prevents DCNN from quickly promoting this research area. To address this problem, we propose a semi-supervised multimodal deep learning framework to train DCNN effectively based on very limited labeled data and massive unlabeled data. The core of our framework is a novel diversity preserving co-training algorithm, which can successfully guide DCNN to learn from the unlabeled RGB-D data by making full use of the complementary cues of the RGB and depth data in object representation. Experiments on the benchmark RGB-D dataset demonstrate that, with only 5% labeled training data, our approach achieves competitive performance for object recognition compared with those state-of-the-art results reported by fully-supervised methods.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Center for Excellence in Education", "CRIPAC&NLPR, CASIA", "CRIPAC&NLPR, CASIA"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yanhua Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Yanhua", "Xin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xin", "Rui Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Rui", "Zhiwei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhiwei", "Kaiqi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Kaiqi", "Yong Rui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rui:Yong"], "pages": 7}
