{"title": "Seesaw: rapid one-handed synchronous gesture interface for smartwatches.", "fields": ["wearable computer", "swipe", "gesture", "smartwatch", "seesaw molecular geometry"], "abstract": "We present SeeSaw, a synchronous gesture interface for commodity smartwatches to support watch-hand only input with no additional hardware. Our algorithm, which uses correlation to determine whether the user is rotating their wrist in synchrony with a tactile and visual prompt, minimizes false-trigger events while maintaining fast input during situational impairments. Results from a 12 person evaluation of the system, used to respond to notifications on the watch during walking and simulated driving, show interaction speeds of 4.0 s - 5.5 s, which is comparable to the swipe-based interface control condition. SeeSaw is also evaluated as an input interface for watches used in conjunction with a head-worn display. A six subject study showed a 95% success rate in dismissing notifications and a 3.57 s mean dismissal time.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jason Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jason", "Cooper Colglazier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colglazier:Cooper", "Adhithya Ravishankar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravishankar:Adhithya", "Yuyan Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Yuyan", "Yuanbo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuanbo", "Thomas Ploetz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ploetz:Thomas", "Thad Starner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starner:Thad"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
