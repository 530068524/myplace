As opposed to the convolution tree kernel, the proposed forest kernel does not have to commit to a single best parse tree, is thus able to explore very large object spaces and much more structured features embedded in a forest. This makes the proposed kernel more robust against parsing errors and data sparseness issues than the convolution tree kernel. The paper presents the formal definition of convolution forest kernel and also illustrates the computing algorithm to fast compute the proposed convolution forest kernel. Experimental results on two NLP applications, relation extraction and semantic role labeling, show that the proposed forest kernel significantly outperforms the baseline of the convolution tree kernel.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Min", "Hui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hui", "Haizhou Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Haizhou"], "pages": 11}
