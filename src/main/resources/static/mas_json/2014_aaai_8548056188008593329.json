{"title": "Optimizing a Start-Stop Controller Using Policy Search.", "fields": ["controller", "search algorithm", "uncorrelated", "reinforcement learning", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We applied a policy search algorithm to the problem of optimizing a start-stop controller--a controller used in a car to turn off the vehicle's engine, and thus save energy, when the vehicle comes to a temporary halt. We were able to improve the existing policy by approximately 12% using real driver trace data. We also experimented with using multiple policies, and found that doing so could lead to a further 8% improvement if we could determine which policy to apply at each stop. The driver's behaviors before stopping were found to be uncorrelated with the policy that performed best; however, further experimentation showed that the driver's behavior during the stop may be more useful, suggesting a useful direction for adding complexity to the underlying start-stop policy.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Ford Motor Company", "Ford Motor Company", "Ford Motor Company", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Noel Hollingsworth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hollingsworth:Noel", "Jason Meyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyer:Jason", "Ryan McGee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGee:Ryan", "Jeffrey Doering.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doering:Jeffrey", "George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George", "Leslie Pack Kaelbling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaelbling:Leslie_Pack"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 6}
