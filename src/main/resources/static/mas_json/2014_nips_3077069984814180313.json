{"title": "Diverse Sequential Subset Selection for Supervised Video Summarization.", "fields": ["determinantal point process", "statistical model", "permutable prime", "sampling", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "Video summarization is a challenging problem with great application potential. Whereas prior approaches, largely unsupervised in nature, focus on sampling useful frames and assembling them as summaries, we consider video summarization as a supervised subset selection problem. Our idea is to teach the system to learn from human-created summaries how to select informative and diverse subsets, so as to best meet evaluation metrics derived from human-perceived quality. To this end, we propose the sequential determinantal point process (seqDPP), a probabilistic model for diverse sequential subset selection. Our novel seqDPP heeds the inherent sequential structures in video data, thus overcoming the deficiency of the standard DPP, which treats video frames as randomly permutable items. Meanwhile, seqDPP retains the power of modeling diverse subsets, essential for summarization. Our extensive results of summarizing videos from 3 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, compared to not only existing unsupervised methods but also naive applications of the standard DPP model.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Boqing Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Boqing", "Wei-Lun Chao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chao:Wei=Lun", "Kristen Grauman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grauman:Kristen", "Fei Sha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sha:Fei"], "pages": 9}
