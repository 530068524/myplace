{"title": "CRIB: consolidated rename, issue, and bypass.", "fields": ["rename", "small number", "microarchitecture", "datapath", "register renaming"], "abstract": "Conventional high-performance processors utilize register renaming and complex broadcast-based scheduling logic to steer instructions into a small number of heavily-pipelined execution lanes. This requires multiple complex structures and repeated dependency resolution, imposing a significant dynamic power overhead. This paper advocates in-place execution of instructions, a power-saving, pipeline-free approach that consolidates rename, issue, and bypass logic into one structure---the CRIB---while simultaneously eliminating the need for a multiported register file, instead storing architected state in a simple rank of latches. CRIB achieves the high IPC of an out-of-order machine while keeping the execution core clean, simple, and low power. The datapath within a CRIB structure is purely combinational, eliminating most of the clocked elements in the core while keeping a fully synchronous yet high-frequency design. Experimental results match the IPC and cycle time of a baseline out-of-order design while reducing dynamic energy consumption by more than 60% in affected structures.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Intel", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Erika Gunadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gunadi:Erika", "Mikko H.
