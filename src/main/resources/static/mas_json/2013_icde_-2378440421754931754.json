{"title": "On answering why-not questions in reverse skyline queries.", "fields": ["data point", "query optimization", "skyline", "query expansion", "web search query"], "abstract": "This paper aims at answering the so called why-not questions in reverse skyline queries. A reverse skyline query retrieves all data points whose dynamic skylines contain the query point. We outline the benefit and the semantics of answering why-not questions in reverse skyline queries. In connection with this, we show how to modify the why-not point and the query point to include the why-not point in the reverse skyline of the query point. We then show, how a query point can be positioned safely anywhere within a region (i.e., called safe region) without losing any of the existing reverse skyline points. We also show how to answer why-not questions considering the safe region of the query point. Our approach efficiently combines both query point and data point modification techniques to produce meaningful answers. Experimental results also demonstrate that our approach can produce high quality explanations for why-not questions in reverse skyline queries.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology"], "authors": ["Md.
