{"title": "FTI: high performance fault tolerance interface for hybrid systems.", "fields": ["exploit", "data intensive computing", "data reduction", "thread", "petascale computing"], "abstract": "Large scientific applications deployed on current petascale systems expend a significant amount of their execution time dumping checkpoint files to remote storage. New fault tolerant techniques will be critical to efficiently exploit post-petascale systems. In this work, we propose a low-overhead high-frequency multi-level checkpoint technique in which we integrate a highly-reliable topology-aware Reed-Solomon encoding in a three-level checkpoint scheme. We efficiently hide the encoding time using one Fault-Tolerance dedicated thread per node. We implement our technique in the Fault Tolerance Interface FTI. We evaluate the correctness of our performance model and conduct a study of the reliability of our library. To demonstrate the performance of FTI, we present a case study of the Mw9.0 Tohoku Japan earthquake simulation with SPECFEM3D on TSUBAME2.0. We demonstrate a checkpoint overhead as low as 8% on sustained 0.1 petaflops runs (1152 GPUs) while checkpointing at high frequency.", "citation": "Citations (235)", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology", "University of Toulouse", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Leonardo Arturo Bautista-Gomez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bautista=Gomez:Leonardo_Arturo", "Seiji Tsuboi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsuboi:Seiji", "Dimitri Komatitsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komatitsch:Dimitri", "Franck Cappello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cappello:Franck", "Naoya Maruyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maruyama:Naoya", "Satoshi Matsuoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsuoka:Satoshi"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2011", "pages": 32}
