In this paper we present a natural interaction based system designed to represent multimedia contents related to the archaeological site of Shawbak, situated in the Petra region of Jordan. Contents are composed of texts, images and videos showing and explaining the archeological site areas and the history of the castle. This system was installed at the  Limonaia di Palazzo Pitti  (Italy) for the archeological exhibition called \"From Petra to Shawbak\".", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Florence", "University of Florence", "University of Florence", "University of Florence", "University of Florence"], "authors": ["Thomas M.
