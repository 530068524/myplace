The processing and management of this massive amount of heterogeneous data consumes enormous resources. We propose an integrated pipeline for 2 D /3 D  data registration aimed at film production, based around the prototype application  Jigsaw . It allows users to efficiently manage and process various data types from digital photographs to 3 D  point clouds. A key step in the use of multi-modal 2 D /3 D  data for content production is the registration into a common coordinate frame ( match moving ). 3 D  geometric information is reconstructed from 2 D  data and registered to the reference 3 D  models using 3 D  feature matching [Kim and Hilton 2014]. We present several highly efficient and robust approaches to this problem. Additionally, we have developed and integrated a fast algorithm for incremental marginal covariance calculation [Ila et al. 2015]. This allows us to estimate and visualize the 3 D  reconstruction error directly on-set, where insufficient coverage or other problems can be addressed right away. We describe the fast hybrid multi-core and GPU accelerated techniques that let us run these algorithms on a laptop.  Jigsaw  has been used and evaluated in several major digital film productions and significantly reduced the time and work required to manage and process on-set data.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Double Negative", "University of Surrey", "Brno University of Technology", "Brno University of Technology", "Double Negative"], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Simon Pabst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pabst:Simon", "Hansung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hansung", "Luk\u00e1s Polok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polok:Luk=aacute=s", "Viorela Ila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ila:Viorela", "Ted Waine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waine:Ted", "Adrian Hilton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hilton:Adrian", "Jeff Clifford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clifford:Jeff"], "pages": 1}
