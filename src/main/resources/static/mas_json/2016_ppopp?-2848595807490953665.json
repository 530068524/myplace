{"title": "Contention-conscious, locality-preserving locks.", "fields": ["lock", "transactional memory", "locality of reference", "thread", "low latency"], "abstract": "Over the last decade, the growing use of cache-coherent NUMA architectures has spurred the development of numerous  locality-preserving  mutual exclusion algorithms. NUMA-aware locks such as HCLH, HMCS, and cohort locks exploit locality of reference among nearby threads to deliver high lock throughput under high contention. However, the hierarchical nature of these locality-aware locks increases latency, which reduces the throughput of uncontended or lightly-contended critical sections. To date, no lock design for NUMA systems has delivered both low latency under low contention and high throughput under high contention.   In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of an adaptive mutual exclusion scheme (AHMCS lock), which employs several orthogonal strategies---a hierarchical MCS (HMCS) lock for high throughput under high contention, Lamport's fast path approach for low latency under low contention, an adaptation mechanism that employs hysteresis to balance latency and throughput under moderate contention, and hardware transactional memory for lowest latency in the absence of contention. The result is a top performing lock that has most properties of an ideal mutual exclusion algorithm. AHMCS exploits the strengths of multiple contention management techniques to deliver high performance over a broad range of contention levels. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AHMCS over prior art.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Rice University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Milind Chabbi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chabbi:Milind", "John M.
