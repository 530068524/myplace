This paper exploits a cellular computing model in the slime mold physarum polycephalum to solve the minimal exposure path problem which is a fundamental problem corresponding to the worst-case coverage in wireless sensor networks. We first formulate the minimal exposure path problem, and then convert it into the shortest path problem by discretizing the monitoring field to a large-scale weighted grid. Inspired by the path-finding capability of physarum, we develop a new optimization algorithm, named as the physarum optimization, for solving the shortest path problem. Our proposed algorithm is with low-complexity and high-parallelism. Moreover, the core mechanism of our physarum optimization is also helpful for designing new graph algorithms and improving routing protocols and topology control in self-organized networks.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Liang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Liang", "Yuning Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yuning", "Huadong Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Huadong", "Xi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Xi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
