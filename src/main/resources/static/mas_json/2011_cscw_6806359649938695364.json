However, integration in research work is not well understood. Based on retrospective interviews with 55 researchers from 52 diverse research projects, we categorized teams as co-acting (50%), coordinated (15%), and integrated (35%). Integration, when it existed, usually began when PIs chose collaborators and pursued integration throughout the project. We describe researchers' experiences and research climates that discouraged or encouraged integration. Implications for policy choices and design include changes in team structuring and technology support.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Duke University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Aruna D.
