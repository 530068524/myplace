{"title": "Monocular Depth Estimation Using Neural Regression Forest.", "fields": ["bernoulli distribution", "parallelizable manifold", "convolutional neural network", "random forest", "monocular"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel deep architecture, called neural regression forest (NRF), for depth estimation from a single image. NRF combines random forests and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Scanning windows extracted from the image represent samples which are passed down the trees of NRF for predicting their depth. At every tree node, the sample is filtered with a CNN associated with that node. Results of the convolutional filtering are passed to left and right children nodes, i.e., corresponding CNNs, with a Bernoulli probability, until the leaves, where depth estimations are made. CNNs at every node are designed to have fewer parameters than seen in recent work, but their stacked processing along a path in the tree effectively amounts to a deeper CNN. NRF allows for parallelizable training of all \"shallow\" CNNs, and efficient enforcing of smoothness in depth estimation results. Our evaluation on the benchmark Make3D and NYUv2 datasets demonstrates that NRF outperforms the state of the art, and gracefully handles gradually decreasing training datasets.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anirban Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Anirban", "Sinisa Todorovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Todorovic:Sinisa"], "pages": 9}
