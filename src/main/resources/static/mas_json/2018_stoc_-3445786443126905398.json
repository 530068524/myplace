There are no known very efficient algorithms for computing the Diameter exactly. Thus, much research has been devoted to how fast this parameter can be  approximated . Chechik et al. [SODA 2014] showed that the diameter can be approximated within a multiplicative factor of 3/2 in O( m  3/2 ) time. Furthermore, Roditty and Vassilevska W. [STOC 13] showed that unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails, no  O ( n  2\u2212e ) time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better than 3/2 in sparse graphs. Thus the above algorithm is essentially optimal for sparse graphs for approximation factors less than 3/2. It was, however, completely plausible that a 3/2-approximation is possible in linear time. In this work we conditionally rule out such a possibility by showing that unless SETH fails no  O ( m  3/2\u2212e ) time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better than 5/3.    Another fundamental set of graph parameters are the Eccentricities. The Eccentricity of a vertex  v  is the distance between  v  and the farthest vertex from  v . Chechik et al. [SODA 2014] showed that the Eccentricities of all vertices can be approximated within a factor of 5/3 in O( m  3/2 ) time and Abboud et al. [SODA 2016] showed that no  O ( n  2\u2212e ) algorithm can achieve better than 5/3 approximation in sparse graphs. We show that the runtime of the 5/3 approximation algorithm is also optimal by proving that under SETH, there is no  O ( m  3/2\u2212e ) algorithm that achieves a better than 9/5 approximation. We also show that no near-linear time algorithm can achieve a better than 2 approximation for the Eccentricities. This is the first lower bound in fine-grained complexity that addresses near-linear time computation.    We show that our lower bound for near-linear time algorithms is essentially tight by giving an algorithm that approximates Eccentricities within a 2+\u03b4 factor in O( m /\u03b4) time for any 0   To establish the above lower bounds we study the  S - T  Diameter problem: Given a graph and two subsets  S  and  T  of vertices, output the largest distance between a vertex in  S  and a vertex in  T . We give new algorithms and show tight lower bounds that serve as a starting point for all other hardness results.    Our lower bounds apply only to sparse graphs. We show that for dense graphs, there are near-linear time algorithms for  S - T  Diameter, Diameter and Eccentricities, with almost the same approximation guarantees as their O( m  3/2 ) counterparts, improving upon the best known algorithms for dense graphs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Arturs Backurs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Backurs:Arturs", "Liam Roditty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roditty:Liam", "Gilad Segal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segal:Gilad", "Virginia Vassilevska Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Virginia_Vassilevska", "Nicole Wein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wein:Nicole"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2018", "pages": 14}
