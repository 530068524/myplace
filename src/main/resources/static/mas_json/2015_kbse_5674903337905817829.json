{"title": "Fast and Precise Symbolic Analysis of Concurrency Bugs in Device Drivers (T).", "fields": ["debugging", "symbolic data analysis", "software bug", "thread", "instruction set"], "abstract": "Concurrency errors, such as data races, make device drivers notoriously hard to develop and debug without automated tool support. We present Whoop, a new automated approach that statically analyzes drivers for data races. Whoop is empowered by symbolic pairwise lockset analysis, a novel analysis that can soundly detect all potential races in a driver. Our analysis avoids reasoning about thread interleavings and thus scales well. Exploiting the race-freedom guarantees provided by Whoop, we achieve a sound partial-order reduction that significantly accelerates Corral, an industrial-strength bug-finder for concurrent programs. Using the combination of Whoop and Corral, we analyzed 16 drivers from the Linux 4.0 kernel, achieving 1.5 -- 20\u00d7 speedups over standalone Corral.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Pantazis Deligiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deligiannis:Pantazis", "Alastair F.
