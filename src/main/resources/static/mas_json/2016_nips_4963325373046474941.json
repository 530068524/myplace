In this paper, we propose a powerful deep structured model that is able to learn complex non-linear functions which encode the dependencies between continuous output variables. We show that inference in our model using proximal methods can be efficiently solved as a feed-foward pass of a special type of deep recurrent neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the tasks of image denoising, depth refinement and optical flow estimation.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Shenlong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shenlong", "Sanja Fidler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fidler:Sanja", "Raquel Urtasun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urtasun:Raquel"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
