{"title": "Argumentation System with Changes of an Agent's Knowledge Base.", "fields": ["probabilistic argumentation", "existential quantification", "multi agent system", "argumentation theory", "static analysis"], "abstract": "This paper discusses a process of argumentation. We propose an algorithm for dynamic treatment of argumentation in which all lines of argumentation are executed in succession, and the agent's knowledge base can change during argumentation. We show that there exists a case in which an agent dynamically loses argumentation that would be considered won by a static analysis. We also show that the algorithm terminates, and describe acceptable arguments that are obtained after the argumentation.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Kwansei Gakuin University", "Kwansei Gakuin University"], "authors": ["Kenichi Okuno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okuno:Kenichi", "Kazuko Takahashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takahashi:Kazuko"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
