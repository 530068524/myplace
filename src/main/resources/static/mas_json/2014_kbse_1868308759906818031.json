Recent approaches compute probabilities of execution paths using symbolic execution, but do not support nondeterminism. Nondeterminism arises naturally when no suitable probabilistic model can capture a program behavior, e.g., for multithreading or distributed systems.   In this work, we propose a technique, based on symbolic execution, to synthesize schedulers that resolve nondeterminism to maximize the probability of reaching a target event. To scale to large systems, we also introduce approximate algorithms to search for good schedulers, speeding up established random sampling and reinforcement learning results through the quantification of path probabilities based on symbolic execution.   We implemented the techniques in Symbolic PathFinder and evaluated them on nondeterministic Java programs. We show that our algorithms significantly improve upon a state-of-the-art statistical model checking algorithm, originally developed for Markov Decision Processes.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Ames Research Center", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Stuttgart", "Stellenbosch University"], "authors": ["Kasper S\u00f8e Luckow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luckow:Kasper_S=oslash=e", "Corina S.
