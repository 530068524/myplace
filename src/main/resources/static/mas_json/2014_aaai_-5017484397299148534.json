{"title": "Sparse Compositional Metric Learning.", "fields": ["training set", "semi supervised learning", "discriminative model", "test data", "scalability"], "abstract": "We propose a new approach for metric learning by framing it as learning a sparse combination of locally discriminative metrics that are inexpensive to generate from the training data. This flexible framework allows us to naturally derive formulations for global, multitask and local metric learning. The resulting algorithms have several advantages over existing methods in the literature: a much smaller number of parameters to be estimated and a principled way to generalize learned metrics to new testing data points. To analyze the approach theoretically, we derive a generalization bound that justifies the sparse combination. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithms on several datasets against state-of-theart metric learning methods. The results are consistent with our theoretical findings and demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of classification performance and scalability.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Yuan Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Yuan", "Aur\u00e9lien Bellet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellet:Aur=eacute=lien", "Fei Sha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sha:Fei"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
