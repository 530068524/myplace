These structures can be analyzed elegantly by augmenting CCG with a class of rules based on the combinator D (Curry and Feys, 1958). We show two ways to derive the D rules: one based on unary composition and the other based on a logical characterization of CCG\u2019s rule base (Baldridge, 2002). We also show how Eisner\u2019s (1996) normal form constraints follow from this logic, ensuring that the D rules do not lead to spurious ambiguities.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Frederick Hoyt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoyt:Frederick", "Jason Baldridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldridge:Jason"], "pages": 9}
