Existing work to detect problematic software focuses mainly on post hoc identification of correlations between bug fixes and code. We propose a new approach to address this problem --- detect when software developers are experiencing difficulty while they work on their programming tasks, and stop them before they can introduce bugs into the code.     In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to classify the difficulty of code comprehension tasks using data from psycho-physiological sensors. We present the results of a study we conducted with 15 professional programmers to see how well an eye-tracker, an electrodermal activity sensor, and an electroencephalography sensor could be used to predict whether developers would find a task to be difficult. We can predict nominal task difficulty (easy/difficult) for a new developer with 64.99% precision and 64.58% recall, and for a new task with 84.38% precision and 69.79% recall. We can improve the Naive Bayes classifier's performance if we trained it on just the eye-tracking data over the entire dataset, or by using a sliding window data collection schema with a 55 second time window. Our work brings the community closer to a viable and reliable measure of task difficulty that could power the next generation of programming support tools.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "Microsoft", "University of Zurich", "Exponent", "University of Zurich"], "authors": ["Thomas Fritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fritz:Thomas", "Andrew Begel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Begel:Andrew", "Sebastian C.
