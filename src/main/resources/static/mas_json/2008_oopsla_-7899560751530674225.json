{"title": "Verifying correct usage of atomic blocks and typestate.", "fields": ["software development", "type theory", "transactional memory", "race condition", "static analysis"], "abstract": "The atomic block, a synchronization primitive provided to programmers in transactional memory systems, has the potential to greatly ease the development of concurrent software. However, atomic blocks can still be used incorrectly, and race conditions can still occur at the level of application logic. In this paper, we present a intraprocedural static analysis, formalized as a type system and proven sound, that helps programmers use atomic blocks correctly. Using  access permissions , which describe how objects are aliased and modified, our system statically prevents race conditions and enforces typestate properties in concurrent programs. We have implemented a prototype static analysis for the Java language based on our system and have used it to verify several realistic examples.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Nels E.
