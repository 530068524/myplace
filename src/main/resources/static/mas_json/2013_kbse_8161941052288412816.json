In practice, incident management is conducted through analyzing a huge amount of monitoring data collected at runtime of a service. Such data-driven incident management faces several significant challenges such as the large data scale, complex problem space, and incomplete knowledge. To address these challenges, we carried out two-year software-analytics research where we designed a set of novel data-driven techniques and developed an industrial system called the Service Analysis Studio (SAS) targeting real scenarios in a large-scale online service of Microsoft. SAS has been deployed to worldwide product datacenters and widely used by on-call engineers for incident management. This paper shares our experience about using software analytics to solve engineers' pain points in incident management, the developed data-analysis techniques, and the lessons learned from the process of research development and technology transfer.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Jian-Guang Lou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lou:Jian=Guang", "Qingwei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Qingwei", "Rui Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Rui", "Qiang Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Qiang", "Dongmei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dongmei", "Tao Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Tao"], "pages": 11}
