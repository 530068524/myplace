Non-negative bases allow strictly additive combinations which have been shown to be part-based as well as relatively sparse. We pursue a discriminative decomposition by coupling NMF objective with a maximum margin classifier, specifically a support vector machine (SVM). Conversely, we propose an NMF based regularizer for SVM. We formulate the joint update equations and propose a new method which identifies the decomposition as well as the classification parameters. We present classification results on synthetic as well as real datasets.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["General Electric", "Epson Research  ... ., San Jose, CA"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mithun Das Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Mithun_Das", "Jing Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Jing"], "pages": 8}
