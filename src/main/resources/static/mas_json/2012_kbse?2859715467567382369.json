The community lacks objective standards and methods to measure the quality of recovery results. This paper proposes an automated technique for recovery evaluation that offers a solution for two main problems in this area. First, a representative testset is generated by a mutation based fuzzing technique that applies knowledge about common syntax errors. Secondly, the quality of the recovery results is automatically measured using an oracle-based evaluation technique. We evaluate the validity of our approach by comparing results obtained by automated evaluation with results obtained by manual inspection. The evaluation shows a clear correspondence between our quality metric and human judgement.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Maartje de Jonge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jonge:Maartje_de", "Eelco Visser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Visser:Eelco"], "pages": 4}
