In this paper, we investigate cooperative relay in CR networks using video as a reference application. We incorporate interference alignment to allow transmitters collaboratively send encoded signals to all CR users, such that undesired signals will be canceled and the desired signal can be decoded at each CR user. We present a stochastic programming formulation, as well as a reformulation that greatly reduces computational complexity. In the cases of a single licensed channel and multiple licensed channels with channel bonding, we develop an optimal distributed algorithm with proven convergence and convergence speed. In the case of multiple channels without channel bonding, we develop a greedy algorithm with a proven performance bound. The algorithms are evaluated with simulations and are shown to achieve considerable gains over two heuristic schemes that do not consider interference alignment.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Auburn University", "Auburn University"], "authors": ["Donglin Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Donglin", "Shiwen Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Shiwen"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
