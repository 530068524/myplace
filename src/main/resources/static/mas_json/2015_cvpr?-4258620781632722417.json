{"title": "Filtered channel features for pedestrian detection.", "fields": ["optical flow", "filter", "pedestrian detection", "random forest", "channel"], "abstract": "This paper starts from the observation that multiple top performing pedestrian detectors can be modelled by using an intermediate layer filtering low-level features in combination with a boosted decision forest. Based on this observation we propose a unifying framework and experimentally explore different filter families. We report extensive results enabling a systematic analysis. Using filtered channel features we obtain top performance on the challenging Caltech and KITTI datasets, while using only HOG+LUV as low-level features. When adding optical flow features we further improve detection quality and report the best known results on the Caltech dataset, reaching 93% recall at 1 FPPI.", "citation": "Citations (214)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shanshan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shanshan", "Rodrigo Benenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benenson:Rodrigo", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 10}
