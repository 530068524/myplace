VR enables new capabilities, impossible in the real world, such as an unobstructed view of the keyboard, without occlusion by the user's physical hands. Several hand representations have been proposed for typing in VR on standard physical keyboards. However, to date, these hand representations have not been compared regarding their performance and effects on presence for VR text entry. Our work addresses this gap by comparing existing hand representations with minimalistic fingertip visualization. We study the effects of four hand representations (no hand representation, inverse kinematic model, fingertip visualization using spheres and video inlay) on typing in VR using a standard physical keyboard with 24 participants. We found that the fingertip visualization and video inlay both resulted in statistically significant lower text entry error rates compared to no hand or inverse kinematic model representations. We found no statistical differences in text entry speed.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Coburg University of Applied Sciences", "University of Passau", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Passau"], "authors": ["Jens Grubert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grubert:Jens", "Lukas Witzani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Witzani:Lukas", "Eyal Ofek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ofek:Eyal", "Michel Pahud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pahud:Michel", "Matthias Kranz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kranz:Matthias", "Per Ola Kristensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kristensson:Per_Ola"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
