We have introduced flexibility into the video recombination process by sequencing video shots in a way that maintains local video consistency and this is combined with exploitation of shot polysemy to enable shot reuse in a range of valid semantic contexts. Results of evaluations on output narratives using a shared set of video data show consistency in terms of local video sequences and global causality with no loss of generative power.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Brescia", "University of Brescia", "University of Brescia", "University of Brescia", "Teesside University"], "authors": ["Alberto Piacenza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piacenza:Alberto", "Fabrizio Guerrini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerrini:Fabrizio", "Nicola Adami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adami:Nicola", "Riccardo Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Riccardo", "Julie Porteous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porteous:Julie", "Jonathan Teutenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teutenberg:Jonathan", "Marc Cavazza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cavazza:Marc"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
