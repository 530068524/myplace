In this paper we study  link prediction with explanations  for user recommendation in social networks. For this problem we propose WTFW (\"Who to Follow and Why\"), a stochastic topic model for link prediction over directed and nodes-attributed graphs. Our model not only predicts links, but for each predicted link it decides whether it is a \"topical\" or a \"social\" link, and depending on this decision it produces a different type of explanation.   A topical link is recommended between a user interested in a topic and a user authoritative in that topic: the explanation in this case is a set of binary features describing the topic responsible of the link creation. A social link is recommended between users which share a large social neighborhood: in this case the explanation is the set of neighbors which are more likely to be responsible for the link creation.   Our experimental assessment on real-world data confirms the accuracy of WTFW in the link prediction and the quality of the associated explanations.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Indian Council of Agricultural Research"], "authors": ["Nicola Barbieri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbieri:Nicola", "Francesco Bonchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonchi:Francesco", "Giuseppe Manco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manco:Giuseppe"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
