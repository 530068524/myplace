A novel approach combining new lag-based reasoning and executing/non-executing gang interval analysis technique is introduced, which is able to characterize the parallelisminduced idleness, as a key challenge of analyzing gang task schedules. To the best of our knowledge, this approach yields the first utilization-based test for hard real-time gang task systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Zheng Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Zheng", "Cong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Cong"], "pages": 11}
