Therefore, our algorithm does not require any explicit construction of the top principal components, and is suitable for large-scale PCR instances. In contrast, previous result requires $\\tilde{O}(\\gamma^{-2})$ such black-box calls. \nWe obtain this result by developing a general stable recurrence formula for matrix Chebyshev polynomials, and a degree-optimal polynomial approximation to the matrix sign function. Our techniques may be of independent interests, especially when designing iterative methods.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Zeyuan Allen-Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allen=Zhu:Zeyuan", "Yuanzhi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanzhi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
