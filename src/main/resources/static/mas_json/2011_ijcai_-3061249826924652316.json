{"title": "Fast Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search with k-Nearest Neighbor Graph.", "fields": ["ball tree", "fixed radius near neighbors", "large margin nearest neighbor", "best bin first", "nearest neighbor graph"], "abstract": "We introduce a new nearest neighbor search algorithm. The algorithm builds a nearest neighbor graph in an offline phase and when queried with a new point, performs hill-climbing starting from a randomly sampled node of the graph. We provide theoretical guarantees for the accuracy and the computational complexity and empirically show the effectiveness of this algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Kiana Hajebi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hajebi:Kiana", "Yasin Abbasi-Yadkori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbasi=Yadkori:Yasin", "Hossein Shahbazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahbazi:Hossein", "Hong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0013:Hong"], "pages": 6}
