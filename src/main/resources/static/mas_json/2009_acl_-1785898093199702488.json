We propose an alignment-based discriminative framework for string similarity. We gather features from substring pairs consistent with a character-based alignment of the two strings. This approach achieves exceptional performance; on nine separate cognate identication experiments using six language pairs, we more than double the precision of traditional orthographic measures like Longest Common Subsequence Ratio and Dice\u2019s Coefcient. We also show strong improvements over other recent discriminative and heuristic similarity functions.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Groningen", "University of Groningen", "University of Groningen", "Microsoft", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "International Institute of Information Technology", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "RWTH Aachen University", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Kyoto University", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Vladimir Pervouchine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pervouchine:Vladimir", "Haizhou Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Haizhou", "Bo Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Bo"], "pages": 9}
