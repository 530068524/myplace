The proposed active sampling strategy is designed to focus on attentional region such as foreground regions. The attentional region is estimated by detection results of previous frame in a recursive probabilistic way. For the estimation of the attentional region, we propose a foreground probability map based on temporal, spatial, and frequency properties of foregrounds. By using this foreground probability map, active attentional sampling scheme is developed to make a minimal sampling mask covering almost foregrounds. The effectiveness of the proposed active sampling method is shown through various experiments. The proposed masking method successfully speeds up pixel-wise background subtraction methods approximately 6.6 times without deteriorating detection performance. Also realtime detection with Full HD video is successfully achieved through various conventional background subtraction algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hyung Jin Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Hyung_Jin", "Hawook Jeong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeong:Hawook", "Jin Young Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi_0002:Jin_Young"], "pages": 8}
