{"title": "CNN-SLAM: Real-Time Dense Monocular SLAM with Learned Depth Prediction.", "fields": ["iterative reconstruction", "pose", "convolutional neural network", "simultaneous localization and mapping", "monocular"], "abstract": "Given the recent advances in depth prediction from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this paper investigates how predicted depth maps from a deep neural network can be deployed for the goal of accurate and dense monocular reconstruction. We propose a method where CNN-predicted dense depth maps are naturally fused together with depth measurements obtained from direct monocular SLAM, based on a scheme that privileges depth prediction in image locations where monocular SLAM approaches tend to fail, e.g. along low-textured regions, and vice-versa. We demonstrate the use of depth prediction to estimate the absolute scale of the reconstruction, hence overcoming one of the major limitations of monocular SLAM. Finally, we propose a framework to efficiently fuse semantic labels, obtained from a single frame, with dense SLAM, so to yield semantically coherent scene reconstruction from a single view. Evaluation results on two benchmark datasets show the robustness and accuracy of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Canon Inc.", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Keisuke Tateno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tateno:Keisuke", "Federico Tombari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tombari:Federico", "Iro Laina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laina:Iro", "Nassir Navab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navab:Nassir"], "pages": 10}
