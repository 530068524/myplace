{"title": "H-Index Manipulation by Merging Articles: Models, Theory, and Experiments.", "fields": ["connected component", "merge", "citation", "citation index", "parameterized complexity"], "abstract": "An author's profile on Google Scholar consists of indexed articles and associated data, such as the number of citations and the H-index. The author is allowed to merge articles, which may affect the H-index. We analyze the parameterized complexity of maximizing the H-index using article merges. Herein, to model realistic manipulation scenarios, we define a compatability graph whose edges correspond to plausible merges. Moreover, we consider multiple possible measures for computing the citation count of a merged article. For the measure used by Google Scholar, we give an algorithm that maximizes the H-index in linear time if the compatibility graph has constant-size connected components. In contrast, if we allow to merge arbitrary articles, then already increasing the H-index by one is NP-hard. Experiments on Google Scholar profiles of AI researchers show that the H-index can be manipulated substantially only by merging articles with highly dissimilar titles, which would be easy to discover.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Ren\u00e9 van Bevern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bevern:Ren=eacute=_van", "Christian Komusiewicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komusiewicz:Christian", "Rolf Niedermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niedermeier:Rolf", "Manuel Sorge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sorge:Manuel", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
