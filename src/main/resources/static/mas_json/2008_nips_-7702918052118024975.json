The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on synthesized waveforms and experimentally recorded sequences. When compared with many spike sorting approaches our algorithm demonstrates improved speed, accuracy and allows unsupervised execution. A preliminary hardware implementation has been realized using an integrated microchip interfaced with a personal computer.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zhi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhi", "Qi Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Qi", "Wentai Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wentai"], "pages": 8}
