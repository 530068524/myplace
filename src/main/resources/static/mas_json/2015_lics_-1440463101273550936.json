We study Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) where both the instance and the template are definable structures with atoms. As an initial step, we consider locally finite templates, which contain potentially infinitely many finite relations. We argue that such templates occur naturally in Descriptive Complexity Theory. We study CSPs over such templates for both finite and infinite, definable instances. In the latter case even decidability is not obvious, and to prove it we apply results from topological dynamics. For finite instances, we show that some central results from the classical algebraic theory of CSPs still hold: the complexity is determined by polymorphisms of the template, and the existence of certain polymorphisms, such as majority or Maltsev polymorphisms, guarantees the correctness of classical algorithms for solving finite CSP instances.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Bartek Klin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klin:Bartek", "Eryk Kopczynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopczynski:Eryk", "Joanna Ochremiak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ochremiak:Joanna", "Szymon Torunczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torunczyk:Szymon"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
