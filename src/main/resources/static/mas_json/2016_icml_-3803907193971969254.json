We show how it is possible to achieve substantially higher computational throughput at low mini-batch sizes than direct implementations of RNNs based on matrix multiplications. The key to our approach is the use of persistent computational kernels that exploit the GPU's inverted memory hierarchy to reuse network weights over multiple timesteps. Our initial implementation sustains 2.8 TFLOP/s at a mini-batch size of 4 on an NVIDIA TitanX GPU. This provides a 16\u00d7 reduction in activation memory footprint, enables model training with 12\u00d7 more parameters on the same hardware, allows us to strongly scale RNN training to 128 GPUs, and allows us to efficiently explore end-to-end speech recognition models with over 100 layers.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Baidu", "Baidu", "Baidu", "Baidu", "Baidu"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Greg Diamos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diamos:Greg", "Shubho Sengupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sengupta:Shubho", "Bryan Catanzaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catanzaro:Bryan", "Mike Chrzanowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chrzanowski:Mike", "Adam Coates.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coates:Adam", "Erich Elsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elsen:Erich", "Jesse Engel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Engel:Jesse", "Awni Y.
