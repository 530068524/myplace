This class of problems is known to be NP-complete in general, but certain restrictions on the form of the constraints can ensure tractability. The standard way to parametrize interesting subclasses of the constraint satisfaction problem is via finite constraint languages. The main problem is to classify those subclasses that are solvable in polynomial time and those that are NP-complete. It was conjectured that if a core of a constraint language has a weak near unanimity polymorphism then the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem is tractable, otherwise it is NP-complete.In the paper we present an algorithm that solves Constraint Satisfaction Problem in polynomial time for constraint languages having a weak near unanimity polymorphism, which proves the remaining part of the conjecture.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2017", "departments": [], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Dmitriy Zhuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuk:Dmitriy"], "pages": 12}
