Random simplicial complexes are tools from algebraic topology which provide an accurate and tractable representation of the topology of wireless sensor networks. Given a simplicial complex, we present an algorithm which reduces the number of its vertices, keeping its homology (i.e. connectivity, coverage) unchanged. We show that the algorithm reaches a Nash equilibrium, moreover we find both a lower and an upper bounds for the number of vertices removed, the complexity of the algorithm, and the maximal order of the resulting complex for the coverage problem. We also give some simulation results for classical cases, especially coverage complexes simulating wireless sensor networks.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Anais Vergne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vergne:Anais", "Laurent Decreusefond.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Decreusefond:Laurent", "Philippe Martins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martins:Philippe"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
