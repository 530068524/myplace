{"title": "Constructing Cryptographic Hash Functions from Fixed-Key Blockciphers.", "fields": ["security of cryptographic hash functions", "swifft", "preimage attack", "cityhash", "2 choice hashing"], "abstract": "We propose a family of compression functions built from fixed-key blockciphers and investigate their collision and preimage security in the ideal-cipher model. The constructions have security approaching and in many cases equaling the security upper bounds found in previous work of the authors [24]. In particular, we describe a 2 n -bit to  n -bit compression function using three  n -bit permutation calls that has collision security  N 0.5, where  N = 2 n , and we describe 3 n -bit to 2 n -bit compression functions using five and six permutation calls and having collision security of at least  N 0.55and  N 0.63.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Phillip Rogaway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogaway:Phillip", "John P.
