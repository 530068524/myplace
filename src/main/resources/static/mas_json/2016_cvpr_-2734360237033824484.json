For the adaptive parameter prediction, we employ a separate parameter prediction network, which consists of gated recurrent unit (GRU) taking a question as its input and a fully-connected layer generating a set of candidate weights as its output. However, it is challenging to construct a parameter prediction network for a large number of parameters in the fully-connected dynamic parameter layer of the CNN. We reduce the complexity of this problem by incorporating a hashing technique, where the candidate weights given by the parameter prediction network are selected using a predefined hash function to determine individual weights in the dynamic parameter layer. The proposed network\u2014joint network with the CNN for ImageQA and the parameter prediction network\u2014is trained end-to-end through back-propagation, where its weights are initialized using a pre-trained CNN and GRU. The proposed algorithm illustrates the state-of-the-art performance on all available public ImageQA benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hyeonwoo Noh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noh:Hyeonwoo", "Paul Hongsuck Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Paul_Hongsuck", "Bohyung Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Bohyung"], "pages": 9}
