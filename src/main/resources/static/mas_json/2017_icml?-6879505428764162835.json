However, some applications require an extension to more general spaces. For example, phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees are defined in terms of both a discrete graph and associated continuous parameters; although one can represent these aspects using a single connected space, this rather complex space is not suitable for existing HMC algorithms. In this paper, we develop Probabilistic Path HMC (PPHMC) as a first step to sampling distributions on spaces with intricate combinatorial structure. We define PPHMC on orthant complexes, show that the resulting Markov chain is ergodic, and provide a promising implementation for the case of phylogenetic trees in open-source software. We also show that a surrogate function to ease the transition across a boundary on which the log-posterior has discontinuous derivatives can greatly improve efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center", "Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center", "Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Vu Dinh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinh:Vu", "Arman Bilge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bilge:Arman", "Cheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Cheng", "Frederick A.
