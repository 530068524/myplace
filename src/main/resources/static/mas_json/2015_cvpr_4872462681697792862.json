Most previous work utilizes low-level features such as texture or saliency to detect contours and then use them as cues for a higher-level task such as object detection. However, we claim that recognizing objects and predicting contours are two mutually related tasks. Contrary to traditional approaches, we show that we can invert the commonly established pipeline: instead of detecting contours with low-level cues for a higher-level recognition task, we exploit object-related features as high-level cues for contour detection.", "citation": "Citations (149)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "Dartmouth College"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Gedas Bertasius.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertasius:Gedas", "Jianbo Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jianbo", "Lorenzo Torresani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torresani:Lorenzo"], "pages": 10}
