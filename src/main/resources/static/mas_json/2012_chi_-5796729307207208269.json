Such devices  always  stay with the user, making their implanted user interfaces  available at all times . We discuss four core challenges of implanted user interfaces: how to sense input through the skin, how to produce output, how to communicate amongst one another and with external infrastructure, and how to remain powered. We investigate these four challenges in a technical evaluation where we surgically implant study devices into a specimen arm. We find that traditional interfaces do work through skin. We then demonstrate how to deploy a prototype device on participants, using artificial skin to simulate implantation. We close with a discussion of medical considerations of implanted user interfaces, risks and limitations, and project into the future.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Autodesk", "Autodesk", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Christian Holz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holz:Christian", "Tovi Grossman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossman:Tovi", "George W.
