{"title": "Reactive information foraging for evolving goals.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "debugging", "computer science", "information foraging", "information seeking"], "abstract": "Information foraging models have predicted the navigation paths of people browsing the web and (more recently) of programmers while debugging, but these models do not explicitly model users' goals evolving over time. We present a new information foraging model called PFIS2 that does model information seeking with potentially evolving goals. We then evaluated variants of this model in a field study that analyzed programmers' daily navigations over a seven-month period. Our results were that PFIS2 predicted users' navigation remarkably well, even though the goals of navigation, and even the information landscape itself, were changing markedly during the pursuit of information.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Oregon State University", "IBM", "Oregon State University", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Joseph Lawrance.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lawrance:Joseph", "Margaret M.
