Here we propose conditional regression forest for this task. While regression forest learn the relations between facial image patches and the location of feature points from the entire set of faces, conditional regression forest learn the relations conditional to global face properties. In our experiments, we use the head pose as a global property and demonstrate that conditional regression forests outperform regression forests for facial feature detection. We have evaluated the method on the challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild [20] database where close-to-human accuracy is achieved while processing images in real-time.", "citation": "Citations (384)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Matthias Dantone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dantone:Matthias", "Juergen Gall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gall:Juergen", "Gabriele Fanelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fanelli:Gabriele", "Luc J.
