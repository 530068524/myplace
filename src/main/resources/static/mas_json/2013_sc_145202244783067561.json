{"title": "Taming parallel I/O complexity with auto-tuning.", "fields": ["genetic algorithm", "multi core processor", "ibm", "hierarchical data format", "parallel i o"], "abstract": "We present an auto-tuning system for optimizing I/O performance of HDF5 applications and demonstrate its value across platforms, applications, and at scale. The system uses a genetic algorithm to search a large space of tunable parameters and to identify effective settings at all layers of the parallel I/O stack. The parameter settings are applied transparently by the auto-tuning system via dynamically intercepted HDF5 calls.   To validate our auto-tuning system, we applied it to three I/O benchmarks (VPIC, VORPAL, and GCRM) that replicate the I/O activity of their respective applications. We tested the system with different weak-scaling configurations (128, 2048, and 4096 CPU cores) that generate 30 GB to 1 TB of data, and executed these configurations on diverse HPC platforms (Cray XE6, IBM BG/P, and Dell Cluster). In all cases, the auto-tuning framework identified tunable parameters that substantially improved write performance over default system settings. We consistently demonstrate I/O write speedups between 2x and 100x for test configurations.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Rice University", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Babak Behzad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Behzad:Babak", "Huong Vu Thanh Luu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luu:Huong_Vu_Thanh", "Joseph Huchette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huchette:Joseph", "Surendra Byna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Byna:Surendra", "Prabhat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhat:", "Ruth A.
