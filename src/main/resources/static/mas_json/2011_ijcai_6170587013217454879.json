{"title": "An Approach to Minimal Belief via Objective Belief.", "fields": ["belief structure", "doxastic logic", "discrete mathematics", "modal logic", "epistemic modal logic"], "abstract": "As a doxastic counterpart to epistemic logic based on S5 we study the modal logic KSD that can be viewed as an approach to modelling a kind of objective and fair belief. We apply KSD to the problem of minimal belief and develop an alternative approach to nonmonotonic modal logic using a weaker concept of expansion. This corresponds to a certain minimal kind of KSD model and yields a new type of nonmonotonic doxastic reasoning.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technical University of Madrid", "Technical University of Madrid"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["David Pearce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pearce_0001:David", "Levan Uridia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uridia:Levan"], "pages": 6}
