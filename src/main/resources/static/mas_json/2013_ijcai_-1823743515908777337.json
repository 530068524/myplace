{"title": "Breaking Symmetries in Graph Representation.", "fields": ["strength of a graph", "friendship graph", "semi symmetric graph", "windmill graph", "simplex graph"], "abstract": "There are many complex combinatorial problems which involve searching for an undirected graph satisfying a certain property. These problems are often highly challenging because of the large number of isomorphic representations of a possible solution. In this paper we introduce novel, effective and compact, symmetry breaking constraints for undirected graph search. While incomplete, these prove highly beneficial in pruning the search for a graph. We illustrate the application of symmetry breaking in graph representation to resolve several open instances in extremal graph theory.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Michael Codish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Codish:Michael", "Alice Miller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miller:Alice", "Patrick Prosser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prosser:Patrick", "Peter James Stuckey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stuckey:Peter_James"], "pages": 7}
