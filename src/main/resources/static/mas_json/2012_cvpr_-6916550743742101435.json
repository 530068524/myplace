In this paper, we show that superpixels (image segments) can provide powerful grouping cues to guide segmentation, where superpixels can be collected easily by (over)-segmenting the image using any reasonable existing segmentation algorithms. Generated by different algorithms with varying parameters, superpixels can capture diverse and multi-scale visual patterns of a natural image. Successful integration of the cues from a large multitude of superpixels presents a promising yet not fully explored direction. In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation framework based on bipartite graph partitioning, which is able to aggregate multi-layer superpixels in a principled and very effective manner. Computationally, it is tailored to unbalanced bipartite graph structure and leads to a highly efficient, linear-time spectral algorithm. Our method achieves significantly better performance on the Berkeley Segmentation Database compared to state-of-the-art techniques.", "citation": "Citations (228)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhenguo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhenguo", "Xiao-Ming Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xiao=Ming", "Shih-Fu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Shih=Fu"], "pages": 8}
