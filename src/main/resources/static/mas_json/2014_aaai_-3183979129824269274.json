The logic has been shown to be more expressive than several variants of ATEL and therefore the algorithm can also be used for ATEL model checking. We implement the algorithm in a model checker and apply it to an application on train control system. The performance of the algorithm is also reported, with a comparison showing improved results over a previous partially symbolic approach for ATEL model checking.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Xiaowei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xiaowei", "Ron van der Meyden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyden:Ron_van_der"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
