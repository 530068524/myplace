{"title": "Faster Private Set Intersection Based on OT Extension.", "fields": ["distributed computing", "combinatorics", "secure multi party computation", "computer science", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "intersection", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Private set intersection (PSI) allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing any information about items that are not in the intersection. It is one of the best studied applications of secure computation and many PSI protocols have been proposed. However, the variety of existing PSI protocols makes it difficult to identify the solution that performs best in a respective scenario, especially since they were not all implemented and compared in the same setting.\n\nIn this work, we give an overview on existing PSI protocols that are secure against semi-honest adversaries. We take advantage of the most recent efficiency improvements in OT extension to propose significant optimizations to previous PSI protocols and to suggest a new PSI protocol whose runtime is superior to that of existing protocols. We compare the performance of the protocols both theoretically and experimentally, by implementing all protocols on the same platform, and give recommendations on which protocol to use in a particular setting.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Benny Pinkas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinkas:Benny", "Thomas Schneider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schneider_0003:Thomas", "Michael Zohner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zohner:Michael"], "pages": 16}
