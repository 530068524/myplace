{"title": "Effectiveness Evaluation with a Subset of Topics: A Practical Approach.", "fields": ["data mining", "cardinality", "computer science", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Several researchers have proposed to reduce the number of topics used in TREC-like initiatives. One research direction that has been pursued is what is the optimal topic subset of a given cardinality that evaluates the systems/runs in the most accurate way. Such a research direction has been so far mainly theoretical, with almost no indication on how to select the few good topics in practice. We propose such a practical criterion for topic selection: we rely on the methods for automatic system evaluation without relevance judgments, and by running some experiments on several TREC collections we show that the topics selected on the basis of those evaluations are indeed more informative than random topics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Udine", "University of Udine", "University of Udine"], "authors": ["Kevin Roitero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roitero:Kevin", "Michael Soprano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soprano:Michael", "Stefano Mizzaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mizzaro:Stefano"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
