Recent studies have shown that poor quality data is prevalent in large databases and on the Web. Since poor quality data can have serious consequences on the results of data analyses, the importance of veracity, the fourth \u2018V\u2019 of big data is increasingly being recognized. In this tutorial, we highlight the substantial challenges that the first three \u2018V\u2019s, volume, velocity and variety, bring to dealing with veracity in big data. Due to the sheer volume and velocity of data, one needs to understand and (possibly) repair erroneous data in a scalable and timely manner. With the variety of data, often from a diversity of sources, data quality rules cannot be specified a priori; one needs to let the \u201cdata to speak for itself\u201d in order to discover the semantics of the data. This tutorial presents recent results that are relevant to big data quality management, focusing on the two major dimensions of (i) discovering quality issues from the data itself, and (ii) trading-off accuracy vs efficiency, and identifies a range of open problems for the community.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs"], "authors": ["Barna Saha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saha:Barna", "Divesh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Divesh"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
