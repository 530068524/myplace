While web technologies are a common standard for applications that enable telepresent collaboration, they do not support the multipointer interaction needed for collaboration in collocated settings. We propose an approach to provide multipointer interaction in web applications by adding multipointer support to the web browser and addressing pointer handling in a JavaScript framework.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Fribourg", "University of Fribourg", "University of Fribourg", "University of Fribourg"], "authors": ["Muriel Bowie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowie:Muriel", "Oliver Schmid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmid:Oliver", "Agnes Lisowska Masson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masson:Agnes_Lisowska", "B\u00e9at Hirsbrunner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirsbrunner:B=eacute=at"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
