A lot of existing technologies for tangible user interface tracking use back- or front-projection setups, but they suffer from poor image quality, shadow casting, non-ergonomic interaction, and/or large installations. Thus, we introduce a principle that allows using the InfrActables' technology on a large LC-display. It combines simultaneous multiuser input on a display with the advantages of a large flat screen. We use infrared photodiodes (IR-LEDs) mounted behind the display's LC-matrix to track infrared diodes in front of the screen. After initial tests concerning the infrared transparency and sensor characteristics, we developed a proof of concept consisting of 384 sensors, which are addressed through a modular master-slave circuit. Using several interaction devices, multiuser interaction is possible.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ramon Hofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofer:Ramon", "Patrick Kaplan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaplan:Patrick", "Andreas M.
