Consequently, probabilistic latent variable models provide an important tool, because they can include explicit models of the ecological phenomenon of interest and the process by which it is observed. However, existing latent variable methods rely on hand-formulated parametric models, which are expensive to design and require extensive preprocessing of the data. Nonparametric methods (such as regression trees) automate these decisions and produce highly accurate models. However, existing tree methods learn direct mappings from inputs to outputs\u2014they cannot be applied to latent variable models.\n\nThis paper describes a methodology for integrating non-parametric tree methods into probabilistic latent variable models by extending functional gradient boosting. The approach is presented in the context of occupancy-detection (OD) modeling, where the goal is to model the distribution of a species from imperfect detections. Experiments on 12 real and 3 synthetic bird species compare standard and tree-boosted OD models (latent variable models) with standard and tree-boosted logistic regression models (without latent structure). All methods perform similarly when predicting the observed variables, but the OD models learn better representations of the latent process. Most importantly, tree-boosted OD models learn the best latent representations when non-linearities and interactions are present.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Rebecca A.
