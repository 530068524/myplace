We focus on email task management: tasks are an implicit part of every inbox, but the overwhelming volume of incoming email can bury important requests. We present  EmailValet , an email client that recruits remote assistants from an expert crowdsourcing marketplace. By annotating each email with its implicit tasks, EmailValet's assistants create a task list that is automatically populated from emails in the user's inbox. The system is an example of a  valet  approach to crowdsourcing, which aims for parsimony and transparency in access con-trol for the crowd. To maintain privacy, users specify rules that define a sliding-window subset of their inbox that they are willing to share with assistants. To support accountability, EmailValet displays the actions that the assistant has taken on each email. In a weeklong field study, participants completed twice as many of their email-based tasks when they had access to crowdsourced assistants, and they became increasingly comfortable sharing their inbox with assistants over time.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Nicolas Kokkalis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kokkalis:Nicolas", "Thomas K\u00f6hn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=hn:Thomas", "Carl Pfeiffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfeiffer:Carl", "Dima Chornyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chornyi:Dima", "Michael S.
