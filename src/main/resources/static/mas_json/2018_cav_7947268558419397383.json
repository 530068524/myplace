Of particular concern is the use of ML algorithms in cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as self-driving cars and aviation, where an adversary can cause serious consequences.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Tommaso Dreossi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dreossi:Tommaso", "Somesh Jha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jha:Somesh", "Sanjit A.
