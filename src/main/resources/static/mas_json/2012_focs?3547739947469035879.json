More specifically, we show that any static data structure for evaluating $P(x)$, where $x \\in \\F$, must use $\\Omega(\\lg |\\F|/\\lg(Sw/n\\lg|\\F|))$ cell probes to answer a query, where $S$ denotes the space of the data structure in number of cells and $w$ the cell size in bits. This bound holds in expectation for randomized data structures with any constant error probability $\\delta", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Aarhus University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Kasper Green Larsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsen:Kasper_Green"], "pages": 9}
