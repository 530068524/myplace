In addition to achieving fast similarity search over large scale data, it is very crucial to represent the complex and high-order relationships among the social contents to improve the semantic understanding of social images.In this paper, unified hypergraph is implemented to model the various relationships among images and other contexts in social media. Moreover, we extend traditional spectral hashing to hypergraph to accelerate similarity search of social images by mapping semantically related vertices into similar binary codes within a short Hamming distance. Furthermore, the proposed HSH approach is extended to out-of-sample data in a supervised manner. We evaluated our approach on the dataset crawled from  Flickr  and the experiment results indicate that our proposed HSH approach is both efficient and effective.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0098:Yang", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Yin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Yin", "Jian Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Jian"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
