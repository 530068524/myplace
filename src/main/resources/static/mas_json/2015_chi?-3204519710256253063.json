{"title": "SwitchBack: Using Focus and Saccade Tracking to Guide Users' Attention for Mobile Task Resumption.", "fields": ["saccade", "computer science", "mobile device", "simulation"], "abstract": "Smartphones and tablets are often used in dynamic environments that force users to break focus and attend to their surroundings, creating a form of \"situational impairment.\" Current mobile devices have no ability to sense when users divert or restore their attention, let alone provide support for resuming tasks. We therefore introduce SwitchBack, a system that allows mobile device users to resume tasks more efficiently. SwitchBack is built upon Focus and Saccade Tracking (FAST), which uses the front-facing camera to determine when the user is looking and how their eyes are moving across the screen. In a controlled study, we found that FAST can identify how many lines the user has read in a body of text within a mean absolute percent error of just 3.9%. We then tested SwitchBack in a dual focus-of-attention task, finding that SwitchBack improved average reading speed by 7.7% in the presence of distractions.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alexander Mariakakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mariakakis:Alexander", "Mayank Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Mayank", "Md Tanvir Islam Aumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aumi:Md_Tanvir_Islam", "Shwetak N.
