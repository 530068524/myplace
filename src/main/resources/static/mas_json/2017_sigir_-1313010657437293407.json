Supervised methods have been proposed recently to learn ranking functions and they have been shown to produce superior results to unsupervised methods. However, these methods use implicit approaches based on the principle of Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR). In this paper, we propose a learning framework for explicit result diversification where subtopics are explicitly modeled. Based on the information contained in the sequence of selected documents, we use attention mechanism to capture the subtopics to be focused on while selecting the next document, which naturally fits our task of document selection for diversification. The framework is implemented using recurrent neural networks and max-pooling which combine distributed representations and traditional relevance features. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms all the existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Zhengbao Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Zhengbao", "Ji-Rong Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Ji=Rong", "Zhicheng Dou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dou:Zhicheng", "Wayne Xin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wayne_Xin", "Jian-Yun Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Jian=Yun", "Ming Yue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yue:Ming"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
