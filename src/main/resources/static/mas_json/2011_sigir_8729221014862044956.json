Identifying points of interest (POIs) in geo-tagged photos is one of these problems. The problem can be viewed as a standard clustering problem of partitioning two dimensional objects. In this work, we study spectral clustering which is the first attempt for the POIs identification. However, there is no unified approach to assign the clustering parameters; especially the features of POIs are immensely varying in different metropolitans and locations. To address this, we are intent to study a self-tuning technique which can properly assign the parameters for the clustering needed.   Besides geographical information, web photos inherently store rich information. These information are mutually influenced each others and should be taken into trip related mining tasks. To address this, we study reinforcement which constructs the relationship over multiple sources by iterative learning. At last, we thoroughly demonstrate our findings by web scale datasets collected from Flickr.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["University of Macau", "University of Macau", "University of Macau"], "authors": ["Yiyang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yiyang", "Zhiguo Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Zhiguo", "Leong Hou U.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/U:Leong_Hou"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
