The automatic recognition of such expressions is important for any natural language processing task that requires text understanding. Prior work has focused on identifying generic noun phrases; we present a new corpus in which not only subjects but also clauses are annotated for genericity according to an annotation scheme motivated by semantic theory. Our contextaware approach for automatically identifying generic expressions uses conditional random fields and outperforms previous work based on local decisions when evaluated on this corpus and on related data sets (ACE-2 and ACE-2005).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Annemarie Friedrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedrich:Annemarie", "Manfred Pinkal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinkal:Manfred"], "pages": 10}
