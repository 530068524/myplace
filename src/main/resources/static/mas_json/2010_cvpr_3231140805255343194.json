Recently, heat kernel signature was introduced as an intrinsic local shape descriptor based on diffusion scale-space analysis. In this paper, we develop a scale-invariant version of the heat kernel descriptor. Our construction is based on a logarithmically sampled scale-space in which shape scaling corresponds, up to a multiplicative constant, to a translation. This translation is undone using the magnitude of the Fourier transform. The proposed scale-invariant local descriptors can be used in the bag-of-features framework for shape retrieval in the presence of transformations such as isometric deformations, missing data, topological noise, and global and local scaling. We get significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms on recently established non-rigid shape retrieval benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (392)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michael M.
