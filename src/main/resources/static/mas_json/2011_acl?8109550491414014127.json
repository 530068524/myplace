We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier evaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets.\n\nA second key issue in ESL error correction is the adaptation of a model to the first language of the writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the non-native writers. We propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Alla Rozovskaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rozovskaya:Alla", "Dan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Dan"], "pages": 10}
