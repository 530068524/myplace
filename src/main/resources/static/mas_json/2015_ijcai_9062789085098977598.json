{"title": "Dissecting German Grammar and Swiss Passports: Open-Domain Decomposition of Compositional Entries in Large-Scale Knowledge Repositories.", "fields": ["data mining", "precision and recall", "german grammar", "natural language processing", "domain decomposition methods"], "abstract": "This paper presents a weakly supervised method that decomposes potentially compositional topics (Swiss passport) into zero or more constituent topics (Switzerland, Passport), where all topics are entries in a knowledge repository. The method increases the connectivity of the knowledge repository and, more importantly, identifies the constituent topics whose meaning can be later aggregated into the meaning of the compositional topics. By exploiting evidence within Wikipedia articles, the method acquires constituent topics of Freebase topics at precision and recall above 0.60, over multiple human-annotated evaluation sets.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Marius Pasca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasca:Marius", "Hylke Buisman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buisman:Hylke"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
