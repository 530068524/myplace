It was shown recently (LICS'13) that it is decidable if such a transduction can be implemented by some one-way transducer, but the given algorithm has non-elementary complexity. We provide an algorithm of different flavor solving the above question, that has double exponential space complexity. We further apply our technique to decide whether the transduction realized by a two-way transducer can be implemented by a sweeping transducer, with either known or unknown number of passes.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux"], "authors": ["F\u00e9lix Baschenis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baschenis:F=eacute=lix", "Olivier Gauwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gauwin:Olivier", "Anca Muscholl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muscholl:Anca", "Gabriele Puppis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Puppis:Gabriele"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
