{"title": "JBMC: A Bounded Model Checking Tool for Verifying Java Bytecode.", "fields": ["java bytecode", "bounded function", "model checking", "java", "software verification"], "abstract": "We present a bounded model checking tool for verifying Java bytecode, which is built on top of the CPROVER framework, named Java Bounded Model Checker (JBMC). JBMC processes Java bytecode together with a model of the standard Java libraries and checks a set of desired properties. Experimental results show that JBMC can correctly verify a set of Java benchmarks from the literature and that it is competitive with two state-of-the-art Java verifiers.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Sussex", "Diffblue Ltd., Oxford, UK", "Diffblue Ltd., Oxford, UK"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Lucas C.
