{"title": "Word Clarity as a Metric in Sampling Keyboard Test Sets.", "fields": ["test set", "representativeness heuristic", "clarity", "bigram", "multi objective optimization"], "abstract": "Test sets play an essential role in evaluating text entry techniques. In this paper, we argue that in addition to the widely adopted metric of bigram representativeness and memorability, word clarity should also be considered as a metric when creating test sets from the target dataset. Word clarity quantifies the extent to which a word is likely to confuse with other words on a keyboard. We formally define word clarity, derive equations calculating it, and both theoretically and empirically show that word clarity has a significant effect on text entry performance: it can yield up to 26.4% difference in error rate, and 25% difference in input speed. We later propose a Pareto optimization method for sampling test sets with different sizes, which optimizes the word clarity and bigram representativeness, and memorability of the test set. The obtained test sets are published on the Internet.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Stony Brook University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Xin Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Xin", "Chun Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Chun", "Weinan Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Weinan", "Xiaojun Bi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bi:Xiaojun", "Yuanchun Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Yuanchun"], "pages": 13}
