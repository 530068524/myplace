We were struck by their playful use, especially given the very limited infrastructure and inexpensive devices that were available. Based on our findings, we discuss tensions between playfulness and utility, in particular relating to socio-economic benefits, and conclude that playfulness in these settings needs to be taken as seriously as in any other setting. Additionally, we formulated three challenges when designing for play in similar settings: (1) engage intimately with the materials of inexpensive ICT; (2) revisit design recommendations for playfulness to ensure that they can travel/translate into other cultures; and (3) alleviate existing tensions.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Stockholm University"], "authors": ["Pedro Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Pedro", "Kristina H\u00f6\u00f6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml==ouml=k:Kristina"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
