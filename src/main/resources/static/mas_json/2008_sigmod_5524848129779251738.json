Generally, a twig pattern could have an extremely large, potentially exponential, number of matches in a graph. Retrieving and returning to the user this many answers may both incur high computational overhead and overwhelm the user.   In this paper we propose two efficient algorithms, DP-B and DP-P, for retrieving top-ranked twig-pattern matches from large graphs. Our first algorithm, DP-B, is able to retrieve exact top-ranked answer matches from potentially exponentially many matches in time and space linear in the size of our data inputs even in the worst case. Further, beyond the linear-cost result of DP-B, our second algorithm, DP-P, could take far less than linear time and space cost in practice. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithms are the first to have these performance properties. Our experimental results demonstrate the high performance of both algorithms on large datasets. We also analyze and compare the performance trade-off between DP-B and DP-P from the theoretical and practical viewpoints.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Gang Gou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gou:Gang", "Rada Chirkova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chirkova:Rada"], "pages": 14}
