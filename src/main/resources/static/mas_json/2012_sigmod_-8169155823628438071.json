How-to queries represent fundamental data analysis questions of the form: \"How should the input change in order to achieve the desired output\". They exemplify an important  Reverse Data Management  problem: solving constrained optimization problems over data residing in a DBMS. Tiresias, named after the mythical oracle of Thebes, has complex under-workings, but includes a simple interface that allows users to load datasets and interactively design optimization problems by simply selecting  actions, key performance indicators , and  objectives . The user choices are translated into a declarative query, which is then processed by Tiresias and translated into a Mixed Integer Program: we then use an MIP solver to find a solution. The solution is then presented to the user as an interactive data instance. The user can provide feedback by rejecting certain tuples and/or values. Then, based on the user feedback, Tiresias automatically  refines  the how-to query and presents a new set of results.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Alexandra Meliou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meliou:Alexandra", "Yisong Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yisong", "Dan Suciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suciu:Dan"], "pages": 4}
