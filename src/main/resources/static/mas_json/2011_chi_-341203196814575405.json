We studied moves in 548 interdisciplinary research projects with 2691 researchers (PIs). Moves, and thus disruptions, were not rare, especially in large distributed projects. Overall, one-third of all projects experienced at least one member relocating but most moves reflected churn across high-ranking institutions. When collaborators moved, the project was disrupted. Our data suggest that moves exemplify normal disruptions. A design challenge is to help projects adapt to disruption.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Duke University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Reza Zadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zadeh:Reza", "Aruna D.
