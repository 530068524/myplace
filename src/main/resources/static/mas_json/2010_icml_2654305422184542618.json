We first define the modes based on graph density function, then propose the graph shift algorithm, which starts from each vertex and iteratively shifts towards the nearest mode of the graph along a certain trajectory. Both theoretic analysis and experiments show that graph shift algorithm is very efficient and robust, especially when there exist large amount of noises and outliers.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Hairong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hairong", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
