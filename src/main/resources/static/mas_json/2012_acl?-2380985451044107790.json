{"title": "Bootstrapping via Graph Propagation.", "fields": ["small set", "data set", "graph", "classifier", "bootstrapping"], "abstract": "Bootstrapping a classifier from a small set of seed rules can be viewed as the propagation of labels between examples via features shared between them. This paper introduces a novel variant of the Yarowsky algorithm based on this view. It is a bootstrapping learning method which uses a graph propagation algorithm with a well defined objective function. The experimental results show that our proposed bootstrapping algorithm achieves state of the art performance or better on several different natural language data sets.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Max Whitney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whitney:Max", "Anoop Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar:Anoop"], "pages": 9}
