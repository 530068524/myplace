A generative model based on epitomic image analysis captures the appearance and geometric structure of an environment while allowing for variations due to motion, occlusions, and non-Lambertian effects. The ability to model translation and scale invariance together with the fusion of diverse visual features yields enhanced generalization with economical training. Experiments on both existing and new labeled image databases result in recognition accuracy superior to state of the art with real-time computational performance.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kai Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Kai", "Anitha Kannan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kannan:Anitha", "Antonio Criminisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Criminisi:Antonio", "John M.
