We give approximation algorithms for these problems exploiting the discrete convexity of submodular functions. We first present a rounding 2-approximation algorithm for the submodular vertex cover problem based on the half-integrality of the continuous relaxation problem, and show that the rounding algorithm can be performed by one application of submodular function minimization on a ring family. We also show that a rounding algorithm and a primal-dual algorithm for the submodular cost set cover problem are both constant factor approximation algorithms if the maximum frequency is fixed. In addition, we give an essentially tight lower bound on the approximability of the submodular edge cover problem.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Satoru Iwata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwata_0001:Satoru", "Kiyohito Nagano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagano:Kiyohito"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
