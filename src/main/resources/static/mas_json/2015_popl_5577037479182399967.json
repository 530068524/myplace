{"title": "Integrating Linear and Dependent Types.", "fields": ["monad", "soundness", "imperative programming", "realizability", "nuprl"], "abstract": "In this paper, we show how to integrate linear types with type dependency, by extending the linear/non-linear calculus of Benton to support type dependency. Next, we give an application of this calculus by giving a proof-theoretic account of imperative programming, which requires extending the calculus with computationally irrelevant quantification, proof irrelevance, and a monad of computations. We show the soundness of our theory by giving a realizability model in the style of Nuprl, which permits us to validate not only the beta-laws for each type, but also the eta-laws. These extensions permit us to decompose Hoare triples into a collection of simpler type-theoretic connectives, yielding a rich equational theory for dependently-typed higher-order imperative programs. Furthermore, both the type theory and its model are relatively simple, even when all of the extensions are considered.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Birmingham", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Neelakantan R.
