We learn an embedded representation that combines both the descriptor similarity and the spatial arrangement in a unified Euclidean embedding space. This unified embedding is reached by minimizing an objective function that has two sources of weights; the feature spatial arrangement and the feature descriptor similarity scores across the different sets. The solution can be obtained directly by solving one Eigen-value problem that is linear in the number of features. Therefore, the framework is very efficient and can scale up to handle a large number of features. Experimental evaluation is done using different sets showing outstanding results compared to the state of the art; up to 100% accuracy is achieved in the case of the well known \u2018Hotel\u2019 sequence.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Marwan Torki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torki:Marwan", "Ahmed M.
