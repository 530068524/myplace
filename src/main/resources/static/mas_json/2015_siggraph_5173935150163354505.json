It is commonly used to form quilts, but can also be used to make bags, wall hangings, cushion covers, and other items. Larger designs are usually based on repeating patterns, which are built up using different shapes. Professional patchwork designers design original patterns; however, novice users usually use geometric patterns or off-the-shelf patterns for each piece; this is because it is difficult for novices to design patterns while visualizing the resulting larger fabric.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba"], "authors": ["Yuki Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Yuki", "Jun Mitani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitani:Jun"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
