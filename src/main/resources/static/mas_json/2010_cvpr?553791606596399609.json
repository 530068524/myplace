Based on the Gestalt principles of grouping we propose to incorporate a low level image segmentation process in order to tackle these problems. Our new motion estimation algorithm is based on non-local total variation regularization which allows us to integrate the low level image segmentation process in a unified variational framework. Numerical results on the Mid-dlebury optical flow benchmark data set demonstrate that we can cope with the aforementioned problems.", "citation": "Citations (236)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Institute for C ... hics and Vision", "Institute for C ... hics and Vision", "Institute for C ... hics and Vision"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Manuel Werlberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Werlberger:Manuel", "Thomas Pock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pock:Thomas", "Horst Bischof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischof:Horst"], "pages": 8}
