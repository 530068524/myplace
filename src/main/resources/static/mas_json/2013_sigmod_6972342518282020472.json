Their construction has been well-studied, but existing techniques are expensive on massive datasets and/or only provide heuristic approximations without theoretical guarantees. We propose randomized and deterministic algorithms with quality guarantees which are orders of magnitude more efficient than previous algorithms. Our algorithms do not require knowledge of the kernel or its bandwidth parameter and are easily parallelizable. We demonstrate how to implement our ideas in a centralized setting and in  MapReduce , although our algorithms are applicable to any large-scale data processing framework. Extensive experiments on large real datasets demonstrate the quality, efficiency, and scalability of our techniques.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yan Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yan", "Jeffrey Jestes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jestes:Jeffrey", "Jeff M.
