These ToF cameras can measure depth scans at video rate. Due to comparably simple technology they bear potential for low cost production in big volumes. Our easy-to-use, cost-effective scanning solution based on such a sensor could make 3D scanning technology more accessible to everyday users. The algorithmic challenge we face is that the sensor's level of random noise is substantial and there is a non-trivial systematic bias. In this paper we show the surprising result that 3D scans of reasonable quality can also be obtained with a sensor of such low data quality. Established filtering and scan alignment techniques from the literature fail to achieve this goal. In contrast, our algorithm is based on a new combination of a 3D superresolution method with a probabilistic scan alignment approach that explicitly takes into account the sensor's noise characteristics.", "citation": "Citations (282)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "MPI Informatik", "MPI Informatik"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yan Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Yan", "Sebastian Schuon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuon:Sebastian", "Derek Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Derek", "Sebastian Thrun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thrun:Sebastian", "Christian Theobalt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobalt:Christian"], "pages": 8}
