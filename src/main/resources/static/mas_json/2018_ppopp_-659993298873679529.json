{"title": "Transparent GPU memory management for DNNs.", "fields": ["heuristics", "exploit", "software", "swap", "memory management"], "abstract": "Modern DNN frameworks exploit GPU acceleration by default to achieve high performance. The limitation of GPU memory capacity becomes a serious problem because DNNs are becoming deeper and larger. This paper proposes a purely software-based transparent solution, called tvDNN, to the GPU memory capacity problem. It is based on GPU memory swapping and memory object sectioning techniques. It also provides an efficient memory-object swapping schedule based on ILP (optimal) and heuristics (suboptimal). The experimental results show that tvDNN enables Caffe to build VGG-16 with a large batch size, such as 256 or 512, using a few GB of GPU memory without significant performance degradation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Hongik University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Jung-Ho Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jung=Ho", "Hyungmin Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Hyungmin", "Wookeun Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Wookeun", "Jaejin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jaejin"], "pages": 2}
