The algorithm leverages the layered structure of the dynamic programming graphs representing the recursive decomposition of the problem to reduce the memory requirements of the algorithm from O(n2n) to O(C(n, n/2)), where C(n, n/2) is the binomial coefficient. Experimental results show that the approach runs up to an order of magnitude faster and scales to datasets with more variables than previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Mississippi State University", "Mississippi State University", "Mississippi State University"], "authors": ["Brandon M.
