{"title": "An audio-driven virtual dance-teaching assistant.", "fields": ["beat", "music theory", "source separation", "rhythm", "dance"], "abstract": "This work addresses the Huawei/3Dlife Grand challenge proposing a set of audio tools for a virtual dance-teaching assistant. These tools are meant to help the dance student develop a sense of rhythm to correctly synchronize his/her movements and steps to the musical timing of the choreographies to be executed. They consist of three main components, namely a music (beat) analysis module, a source separation and remastering module and a dance step segmentation module. These components enable to create augmented tutorial videos highlighting the rhythmic information using, for instance, a synthetic dance teacher voice, but also videos highlighting the steps executed by a student to help in the evaluation of his/her performance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "robin.tournemen ... , Paris, France"], "authors": ["Slim Essid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Essid:Slim", "Yves Grenier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grenier:Yves", "Mounira Maazaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maazaoui:Mounira", "Ga\u00ebl Richard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Richard:Ga=euml=l", "Robin Tournemenne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tournemenne:Robin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
