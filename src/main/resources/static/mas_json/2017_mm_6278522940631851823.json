In contrast with prior studies, we provide a detailed experimental analysis of cross-layer optimization by developing a real system and conducting extensive experiments. In addition, we present an enhanced cross-layer optimization solution that allocates bandwidth to different cameras in a manner that optimizes the overall detection accuracy. The solution works with the popular HTTP streaming approach and includes a new online scheme for estimating the effective airtime of the network. The results show that the proposed solution significantly improves the detection accuracy.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Wayne State University", "Wayne State University"], "authors": ["Sina Gholamnejad Davani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davani:Sina_Gholamnejad", "Nabil J.
