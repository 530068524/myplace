{"title": "Predicting Good Features for Image Geo-Localization Using Per-Bundle VLAD.", "fields": ["computer vision", "visual word", "bundle", "feature detection", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "We address the problem of recognizing a place depicted in a query image by using a large database of geo-tagged images at a city-scale. In particular, we discover features that are useful for recognizing a place in a data-driven manner, and use this knowledge to predict useful features in a query image prior to the geo-localization process. This allows us to achieve better performance while reducing the number of features. Also, for both learning to predict features and retrieving geo-tagged images from the database, we propose per-bundle vector of locally aggregated descriptors (PBVLAD), where each maximally stable region is described by a vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) on multiple scale-invariant features detected within the region. Experimental results show the proposed approach achieves a significant improvement over other baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Hyo Jin Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyo_Jin", "Enrique Dunn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunn:Enrique", "Jan-Michael Frahm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frahm:Jan=Michael"], "pages": 9}
