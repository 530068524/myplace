These rules have the same logical form as TGD (tuple-generating dependencies) in databases and as conceptual graph rules. We extend known decidable cases by combining backward and forward chaining schemes, in association with a graph that captures exactly the notion of dependency between rules. Finally, we draw a map of known decidable cases, including an extension obtained by combining our approach with very recent results on TGD.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "IMERIR, LIRMM"], "authors": ["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Baget.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baget:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois", "Michel Lecl\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lecl=egrave=re:Michel", "Marie-Laure Mugnier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mugnier:Marie=Laure", "Eric Salvat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salvat:Eric"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
