{"title": "TUCH: Turning Cross-view Hashing into Single-view Hashing via Generative Adversarial Nets.", "fields": ["feature hashing", "language model", "hash function", "versa", "binary code"], "abstract": "Cross-view retrieval, which focuses on searching images as response to text queries or vice versa, has received increasing attention recently. Cross-view hashing is to efficiently solve the cross-view retrieval problem with binary hash codes. Most existing works on cross-view hashing exploit multi-view embedding method to tackle this problem, which inevitably causes the information loss in both image and text domains. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), this paper presents a new model that is able to Turn Cross-view Hashing into single-view hashing (TUCH), thus enabling the information of image to be preserved as much as possible. TUCH is a novel deep architecture that integrates a language model network T for text feature extraction, a generator network G to generate fake images from text feature and a hashing network H for learning hashing functions to generate compact binary codes. Our architecture effectively unifies joint generative adversarial learning and cross-view hashing. Extensive empirical evidence shows that our TUCH approach achieves state-of-the-art results, especially on text to image retrieval, based on image-sentences datasets, i.e. standard IAPRTC-12 and large-scale Microsoft COCO.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Lancaster University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xin", "Guiguang Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Guiguang", "Yuchen Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yuchen", "Jungong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jungong", "Yue Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yue"], "pages": 7}
