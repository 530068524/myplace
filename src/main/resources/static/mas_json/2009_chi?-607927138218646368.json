{"title": "Wetpaint: scraping through multi-layered images.", "fields": ["metaphor", "depth perception", "annotation", "gesture", "tangible user interface"], "abstract": "We introduce a technique for exploring multi-layered images by scraping arbitrary areas to determine meaningful relationships. Our system, called Wetpaint, uses perceptual depth cues to help users intuitively navigate between corresponding layers of an image, allowing a rapid assessment of changes and relationships between different views of the same area. Inspired by art diagnostic techniques, this tactile method could have distinct advantages in the general domain as shown by our user study. We propose that the physical metaphor of scraping facilitates the process of determining correlations between layers of an image because it compresses the process of planning, comparison and annotation into a single gesture. We discuss applications for geography, design, and medicine.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Leonardo Bonanni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonanni:Leonardo", "Xiao Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0001:Xiao", "Matthew Hockenberry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hockenberry:Matthew", "Praveen Subramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramani:Praveen", "Hiroshi Ishii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishii_0001:Hiroshi", "Maurizio Seracini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seracini:Maurizio", "J\u00fcrgen P.
