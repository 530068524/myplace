{"title": "Discriminative learning of relaxed hierarchy for large-scale visual recognition.", "fields": ["binary classification", "contextual image classification", "multiclass classification", "discriminative model", "directed acyclic graph"], "abstract": "In the real visual world, the number of categories a classifier needs to discriminate is on the order of hundreds or thousands. For example, the SUN dataset [24] contains 899 scene categories and ImageNet [6] has 15,589 synsets. Designing a multiclass classifier that is both accurate and fast at test time is an extremely important problem in both machine learning and computer vision communities. To achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and speed, we adopt the relaxed hierarchy structure from [15], where a set of binary classifiers are organized in a tree or DAG (directed acyclic graph) structure. At each node, classes are colored into positive and negative groups which are separated by a binary classifier while a subset of confusing classes is ignored. We color the classes and learn the induced binary classifier simultaneously using a unified and principled max-margin optimization. We provide an analysis on generalization error to justify our design. Our method has been tested on both Caltech-256 (object recognition) [9] and the SUN dataset (scene classification) [24], and shows significant improvement over existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (164)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Tianshi Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Tianshi", "Daphne Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Daphne"], "pages": 8}
