PowerDial transforms static configuration parameters into dynamic knobs that the PowerDial control system can manipulate to dynamically trade off the accuracy of the computation in return for reductions in the computational resources that the application requires to produce its results. These reductions translate directly into performance improvements and power savings.   Our experimental results show that PowerDial can enable our benchmark applications to execute responsively in the face of power caps that would otherwise significantly impair responsiveness. They also show that PowerDial can significantly reduce the number of machines required to service intermittent load spikes, enabling reductions in power and capital costs.", "citation": "Citations (292)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Henry Hoffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoffmann:Henry", "Stelios Sidiroglou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sidiroglou:Stelios", "Michael Carbin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carbin:Michael", "Sasa Misailovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Misailovic:Sasa", "Anant Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Anant", "Martin C.
