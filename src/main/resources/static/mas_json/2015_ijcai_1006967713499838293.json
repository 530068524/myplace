In order to represent the objects, we propose a multi-graph-view model which uses graphs constructed from multiple graph-views to represent an object. In addition, a bag based multi-graph model is further used to relax labeling by only requiring one label for a bag of graphs, which represent one object. In order to learn classification models, we propose a multi-graph-view bag learning algorithm (MGVBL), which aims to explore subgraph features from multiple graphviews for learning. By enabling a joint regularization across multiple graph-views, and enforcing labeling constraints at the bag and graph levels, MGVBL is able to discover most effective subgraph features across all graph-views for learning. Experiments on real-world learning tasks demonstrate the performance of MGVBL for complicated object classification.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["China University of Geosciences", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Florida Atlantic University", "China University of Geosciences", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "authors": ["Jia Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jia", "Shirui Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Shirui", "Xingquan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xingquan", "Zhihua Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Zhihua", "Chengqi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chengqi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
