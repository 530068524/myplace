But when the dictionary is large and the data dimension is high, it is a computationally challenging problem. We explore three aspects of the problem. First, we derive new, greatly improved screening tests that quickly identify codewords that are guaranteed to have zero weights. Second, we study the properties of random projections in the context of learning sparse representations. Finally, we develop a hierarchical framework that uses incremental random projections and screening to learn, in small stages, a hierarchically structured dictionary for sparse representations. Empirical results show that our framework can learn informative hierarchical sparse representations more efficiently.", "citation": "Citations (121)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zhen James Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Zhen_James", "Hao Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Hao", "Peter J.
