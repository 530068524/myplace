{"title": "The Markov Assumption: Formalization and Impact.", "fields": ["markov property", "semantic interpretation", "markov chain", "discrete mathematics", "markov model"], "abstract": "We provide both a semantic interpretation and logical (inferential) characterization of the Markov principle that underlies the main action theories in AI. This principle will be shown to constitute a nonmonotonic assumption that justifies the actual restrictions on action descriptions in these theories, as well as constraints on allowable queries. It will be shown also that the well-known regression principle is a consequence of the Markov assumption, and it is valid also for non-deterministic domains.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Holon Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Alexander Bochman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bochman:Alexander"], "pages": 7}
