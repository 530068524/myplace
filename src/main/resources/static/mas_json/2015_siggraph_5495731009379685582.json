For this purpose, displays need to provide both vertical and horizontal images at the same time. To display cross-sectional images, an LCD display [Cassinelli et al. 2009] and image projection [Nagakura et al. 2006] have been proposed. Although these displays could show internal images of volumetric objects, seamless crossing of internal and external images cannot be realized since the images are limited to physical displays.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Hiroki Yamamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamamoto:Hiroki", "Hajime Kajita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kajita:Hajime", "Hanyuool Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hanyuool", "Naoya Koizumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koizumi:Naoya", "Takeshi Naemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naemura:Takeshi"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
