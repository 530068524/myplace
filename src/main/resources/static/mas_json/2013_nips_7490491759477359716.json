Most robust optimization approaches for these problems have focussed on the computation of maximin policies which maximize the value corresponding to the worst realization of the uncertainty. Recent work has proposed minimax regret as a suitable alternative to the maximin objective for robust optimization. However, existing algorithms for handling minimax regret are restricted to models with uncertainty over rewards only. We provide algorithms that employ sampling to improve across multiple dimensions: (a) Handle uncertainties over both transition and reward models; (b) Dependence of model uncertainties across state, action pairs and decision epochs; (c) Scalability and quality bounds. Finally, to demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our sampling approaches, we provide comparisons against benchmark algorithms on two domains from literature. We also provide a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) analysis to compute a posteriori error bounds.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Asrar Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Asrar", "Pradeep Varakantham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varakantham:Pradeep", "Yossiri Adulyasak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adulyasak:Yossiri", "Patrick Jaillet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaillet:Patrick"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
