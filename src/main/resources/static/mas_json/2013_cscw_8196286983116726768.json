{"title": "Real-time crowd labeling for deployable activity recognition.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "cognition", "activity recognition", "crowds", "data mining"], "abstract": "Systems that automatically recognize human activities offer the potential of timely, task-relevant information and support. For example, prompting systems can help keep people with cognitive disabilities on track and surveillance systems can warn of activities of concern. Current automatic systems are difficult to deploy because they cannot identify novel activities, and, instead, must be trained in advance to recognize important activities. Identifying and labeling these events is time consuming and thus not suitable for real-time support of already-deployed activity recognition systems. In this paper, we introduce Legion:AR, a system that provides robust, deployable activity recognition by supplementing existing recognition systems with on-demand, real-time activity identification using input from the crowd.   Legion:AR uses activity labels collected from crowd workers to train an automatic activity recognition system online to automatically recognize future occurrences. To enable the crowd to keep up with real-time activities, Legion:AR intelligently merges input from multiple workers into a single ordered label set. We validate Legion:AR across multiple domains and crowds and discuss features that allow appropriate privacy and accuracy tradeoffs.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Walter S.
