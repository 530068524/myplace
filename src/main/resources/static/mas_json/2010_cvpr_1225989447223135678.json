Both the fit and the update become much faster while attaining results of similar quality, and afford dealing with far larger datasets (10 5  points). We show in a number of benchmarks how the algorithm efficiently learns good latent coordinates and bidirectional mappings between the data and latent space, even with very noisy or low-quality initializations, often drastically improving the result of spectral and other methods.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Miguel \u00c1.
