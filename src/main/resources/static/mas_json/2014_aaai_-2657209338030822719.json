In this paper, we adapt a recent structured prediction framework called HC-Search for multi-label prediction problems. One of the main advantages of this framework is that its training is sensitive to the loss function, unlike the other multilabel approaches that either assume a specific loss function or require a manual adaptation to each loss function. We empirically evaluate our instantiation of the HC-Search framework along with many existing multilabel learning algorithms on a variety of benchmarks by employing diverse task loss functions. Our results demonstrate that the performance of existing algorithms tends to be very similar in most cases, and that the HC-Search approach is comparable and often better than all the other algorithms across different loss functions.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Janardhan Rao Doppa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doppa:Janardhan_Rao", "Jun Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jun", "Chao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma_0001:Chao", "Alan Fern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern:Alan", "Prasad Tadepalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tadepalli:Prasad"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
