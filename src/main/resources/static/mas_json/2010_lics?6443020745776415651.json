{"title": "A Finiteness Structure on Resource Terms.", "fields": ["topological vector space", "finitary", "algebraic number", "denotational semantics", "system f"], "abstract": "We study the Taylor expansion of lambda-terms in a on-deterministic or algebraic setting, where terms can be added. The target language is a resource lambda calculus based on a differential lambda-calculus that we introduced recently. This operation is not possible in the general untyped case where reduction can produce unbounded coefficients. We endow resource terms with a finiteness structure (in the sense of our earlier work on finiteness spaces) and show that the Taylor expansions of terms typeable in Girard's system F are finitary by a reducibility method.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Preuves, Progra ... , Paris, France"], "authors": ["Thomas Ehrhard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ehrhard:Thomas"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
