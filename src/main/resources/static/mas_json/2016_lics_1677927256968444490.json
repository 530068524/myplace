A formula is in Hanf normal form if it is a Boolean combination of formulas \u03b6(x) describing the isomorphism type of a local neighbourhood around its free variables x and statements of the form \"the number of witnesses y of \u03c8(y) belongs to (Q+k)\" where Q \u2208 Q, k \u2208 N, and \u03c8 describes the isomorphism type of a local neighbourhood around its unique free variable y.   We show that a formula from FO(Q) can be transformed into a formula in Hanf normal form that is equivalent on all structures of degree \u2264 d if, and only if, all counting quantifiers occurring in the formula are ultimately periodic. This transformation can be carried out in worst-case optimal 3-fold exponential time.   In particular, this yields an algorithmic version of Nurmonen's extension of Hanf's theorem for first-order logic with modulo-counting quantifiers. As an immediate consequence, we obtain that on finite structures of degree \u2264 d, model checking of first-order logic with modulo-counting quantifiers is fixed-parameter tractable.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Humboldt University of Berlin", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau", "Humboldt University of Berlin"], "authors": ["Lucas Heimberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heimberg:Lucas", "Dietrich Kuske.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuske:Dietrich", "Nicole Schweikardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schweikardt:Nicole"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
