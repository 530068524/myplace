{"title": "Program-Adaptive Mutational Fuzzing.", "fields": ["mutation testing", "dependency relation", "fuzz testing", "symbolic data analysis", "leverage"], "abstract": "We present the design of an algorithm to maximize the number of bugs found for black-box mutational fuzzing given a program and a seed input. The major intuition is to leverage white-box symbolic analysis on an execution trace for a given program-seed pair to detect dependencies among the bit positions of an input, and then use this dependency relation to compute a probabilistically optimal mutation ratio for this program-seed pair. Our result is promising: we found an average of 38.6% more bugs than three previous fuzzers over 8 applications using the same amount of fuzzing time.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Sang Kil Cha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cha:Sang_Kil", "Maverick Woo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woo:Maverick", "David Brumley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brumley:David"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2015", "pages": 17}
