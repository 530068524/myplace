While the proposed criterion is computationally scalable for massive data sets, it is also shown to be asymptotically optimal under mild conditions. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated by extensive simulations and an application to Million Song Dataset.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Binghamton University", "Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Ganggang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ganggang", "Zuofeng Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Zuofeng", "Guang Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Guang"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
