The note attached to the side of the monitor, the papers spread out on the desk, diagrams scrawled on a whiteboard, and even the keys left out on the counter are all examples of using space to recall, reveal relationships, and think. Technological advances have made it possible to construct large display environments in which space has real meaning. This paper examines how increased space affects the way displays are regarded and used within the context of the cognitively demanding task of sensemaking. A pair of studies were conducted demonstrating how the spatial environment supports sensemaking by becoming part of the distributed cognitive process, providing both external memory and a semantic layer.", "citation": "Citations (240)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christopher Andrews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrews:Christopher", "Alex Endert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Endert:Alex", "Chris North.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/North:Chris"], "pages": 10}
