Our approach is based on extending information regularization framework to boosting, bearing loss functions that combine log loss on labeled data with the information-theoretic measures to encode unlabeled data. Even though the information-theoretic regularization terms make the optimization non-convex, we propose simple sequential gradient descent optimization algorithms, and obtain impressively improved results on synthetic, benchmark and real world tasks over supervised boosting algorithms which use the labeled data alone and a state-of-the-art semi-supervised boosting algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Wright State University", "Wright State University", "Wright State University", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Lei Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Lei", "Shaojun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shaojun", "Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yan", "Chi-Hoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chi=Hoon"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
