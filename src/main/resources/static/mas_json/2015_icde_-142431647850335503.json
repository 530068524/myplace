{"title": "Query-time record linkage and fusion over Web databases.", "fields": ["online aggregation", "web query classification", "cache", "query expansion", "web search query"], "abstract": "Data-intensive Web applications usually require integrating data from Web sources at query time. The sources may refer to the same real-world entity in different ways and some may even provide outdated or erroneous data. An important task is to recognize and merge the records that refer to the same real world entity at query time. Most existing duplicate detection and fusion techniques work in the off-line setting and do not meet the online constraint. There are at least two aspects that differentiate online duplicate detection and fusion from its off-line counterpart. (i) The latter assumes that the entire data is available, while the former cannot make such an assumption. (ii) Several query submissions may be required to compute the \u201cideal\u201d representation of an entity in the online setting. This paper presents a general framework for the online setting based on an iterative record-based caching technique. A set of frequently requested records is deduplicated off-line and cached for future reference. Newly arriving records in response to a query are deduplicated jointly with the records in the cache, presented to the user and appended to the cache. Experiments with real and synthetic data show the benefit of our solution over traditional record linkage techniques applied to an online setting.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Temple University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["El Kindi Rezig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezig:El_Kindi", "Eduard C.
