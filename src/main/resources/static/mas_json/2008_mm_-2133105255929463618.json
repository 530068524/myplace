VCI is an emerging application of video analysis and has been used in video augmentation and advertisement insertion. There are three critical issues for a VCI system: when (time), where (place) and how (method) to insert the Virtual Content (VC) into the video. Our system selects the insertion time and place by performing temporal and spatial attention analysis, which predicts the attention change along time and the attended region over space. In order to enable the inserted VC to be noticed by audience while not to interrupt the audience's viewing experience to the original content, the VC should be inserted at the time when the video content attracts much audience attention and at the place where attracts less. Dynamic insertion is performed by using Global Motion Estimation (GME) and affine transformation. Our VCI system is able to obtain an optimal balance between the notice of the VC by audience and disruption of viewing experience to the original content. Extensive subjective evaluations based on user study on the VCI result have verified the effectiveness of the system.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Huiying Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Huiying", "Shuqiang Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Shuqiang", "Qingming Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Qingming", "Changsheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Changsheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
