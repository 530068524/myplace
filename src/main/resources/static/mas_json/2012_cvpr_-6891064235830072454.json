These include human computer interaction, video surveillance, face and expression recognition. In most prior work on heads pose estimation, the positions of the faces on which the pose is to be estimated are specified manually. Therefore, the results are reported without studying the effect of misalignment. We propose a method based on partial least squares (PLS) regression to estimate pose and solve the alignment problem simultaneously. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: 1) we show that the kernel version of PLS (kPLS) achieves better than state-of-the-art results on the estimation problem and 2) we develop a technique to reduce misalignment based on the learned PLS factors.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Murad Al Haj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haj:Murad_Al", "Jordi Gonz\u00e0lez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonz=agrave=lez_0001:Jordi", "Larry S.
