We provide improved running time estimates for the state-of-the-art continuous algorithms for the problem using combinatorial arguments. We also provide a systematic experimental comparison of the two types of methods, based on a clear distinction between level-0 and level-1 algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "Northeastern University", "London School of Economics and Political Science"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alina Ene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ene:Alina", "Huy L.
