In the present paper, we consider the problem of estimating cosine similarities when the projected data undergo scalar quantization to $b$ bits. We here argue that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is a principled approach to deal with the non-linearity resulting from quantization, and subsequently study its computational and statistical properties. A specific focus is on the on the trade-off between bit depth and the number of projections given a fixed budget of bits for storage or transmission. Along the way, we also touch upon the existence of a qualitative counterpart to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma in the presence of quantization.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Harvard University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Ping Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Ping", "Michael Mitzenmacher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitzenmacher:Michael", "Martin Slawski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slawski:Martin"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
