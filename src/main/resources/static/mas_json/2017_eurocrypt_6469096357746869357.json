{"title": "Revisiting Lattice Attacks on Overstretched NTRU Parameters.", "fields": ["lattice reduction", "ntru", "cryptosystem", "homomorphic encryption", "ntruencrypt"], "abstract": "In 2016, Albrecht, Bai and Ducas and independently Cheon, Jeong and Lee presented very similar attacks to break the NTRU cryptosystem with larger modulus than in the NTRUEncrypt standard. They allow to recover the secret key given the public key of Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes based on NTRU ideas. Hopefully, these attacks do not endanger the security of the NTRUEncrypt, but shed new light on the hardness of the NTRU problem. The idea consists in decreasing the dimension of the NTRU lattice using the multiplication matrix by the norm (resp. trace) of the public key in some subfield instead of the public key itself. Since the dimension of the subfield is smaller, so is the dimension of the lattice and better lattice reduction algorithms perform.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Institut Universitaire de France"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Paul Kirchner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirchner:Paul", "Pierre-Alain Fouque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fouque:Pierre=Alain"], "pages": 24}
