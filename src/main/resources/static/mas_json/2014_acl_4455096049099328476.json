In this paper, we present the limitations of constituency based discourse parsing and first propose to use dependency structure to directly represent the relations between elementary discourse units (EDUs). The state-of-the-art dependency parsing techniques, the Eisner algorithm and maximum spanning tree (MST) algorithm, are adopted to parse an optimal discourse dependency tree based on the arcfactored model and the large-margin learning techniques. Experiments show that our discourse dependency parsers achieve a competitive performance on text-level discourse parsing.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sujian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Sujian", "Liang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Liang", "Ziqiang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Ziqiang", "Wenjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenjie"], "pages": 11}
