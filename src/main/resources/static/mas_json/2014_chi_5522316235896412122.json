While users often turn to search engines to learn about serious or highly stigmatic conditions, a surprising amount of sensitive health information is also sought and shared via social media, in our case the public social plat-form Twitter. We contrast what health content people seek via search engines vs. share on social media, as well as why they choose a particular platform for online health activi-ties. We reflect on the implications of our results for design-ing search engines, social media, and social search tools that better support people's health information seeking and sharing needs.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Munmun De Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Munmun_De", "Meredith Ringel Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Meredith_Ringel", "Ryen W.
