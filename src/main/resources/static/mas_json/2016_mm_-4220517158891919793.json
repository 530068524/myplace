{"title": "Robust Visual-Textual Sentiment Analysis: When Attention meets Tree-structured Recursive Neural Networks.", "fields": ["recursion", "parsing", "sentiment analysis", "classifier", "sentence"], "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is crucial for extracting social signals from social media content. Due to huge variation in social media, the performance of sentiment classifiers using single modality (visual or textual) still lags behind satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a new framework that integrates textual and visual information for robust sentiment analysis. Different from previous work, we believe visual and textual information should be treated jointly in a structural fashion. Our system first builds a semantic tree structure based on sentence parsing, aimed at aligning textual words and image regions for accurate analysis. Next, our system learns a robust joint visual-textual semantic representation by incorporating 1) an attention mechanism with LSTM (long short term memory) and 2) an auxiliary semantic learning task. Extensive experimental results on several known data sets show that our method outperforms existing the state-of-the-art joint models in sentiment analysis. We also investigate different tree-structured LSTM (T-LSTM) variants and analyze the effect of the attention mechanism in order to provide deeper insight on how the attention mechanism helps the learning of the joint visual-textual sentiment classifier.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "Yahoo!", "Adobe Systems", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Quanzeng You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Quanzeng", "Liangliang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Liangliang", "Hailin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Hailin", "Jiebo Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jiebo"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
