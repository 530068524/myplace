This process allows us to quickly filter potential candidate relations, without spending too much time to consider bad candidates. However, from an asymptotic point of view, there is not much difference between sieving and straightforward testing of candidates. The reason is that even when sieving, some small amount of time is spent for each bad candidate. Thus, asymptotically, the total number of candidates contributes to the complexity.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["CryptoExperts a ... tin-en-Yvelines"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Antoine Joux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joux:Antoine"], "pages": 17}
