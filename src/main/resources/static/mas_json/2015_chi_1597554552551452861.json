{"title": "Eco-Forecasting for Domestic Electricity Use.", "fields": ["electricity", "electricity retailing", "wind power", "domestic energy consumption", "electricity market"], "abstract": "Over the past decade we have seen an increased awareness about domestic energy consumption and a growing focus on eco-feedback displays. In this paper we explore the concept of providing forecasts in such displays as a supplement to information about past usage. Our prototype, eForecast, extends the display of past electricity usage with forecasts about expected usage, electricity price, availability of wind power, and expected demand drops and peaks. Building on previous eco-feedback display research, our approach specifically enables people to use electricity at more opportune times -- when it is cheap, green, or when there is an abundance of capacity. We evaluated eForecast in real world use in three domestic households for 22 weeks, where we explored potentials and limitations of forecasting for shifting electricity consumption. In this way, families were able to act in a more sustainable way -- without necessarily reducing the amount of electricity consumed.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jesper Kjeldskov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kjeldskov:Jesper", "Mikael B.
