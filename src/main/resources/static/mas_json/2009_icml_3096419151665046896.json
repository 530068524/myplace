{"title": "Group lasso with overlap and graph lasso.", "fields": ["penalty method", "empirical risk minimization", "covariate", "estimator", "lasso"], "abstract": "We propose a new penalty function which, when used as regularization for empirical risk minimization procedures, leads to sparse estimators. The support of the sparse vector is typically a union of potentially overlapping groups of co-variates defined a priori, or a set of covariates which tend to be connected to each other when a graph of covariates is given. We study theoretical properties of the estimator, and illustrate its behavior on simulated and breast cancer gene expression data.", "citation": "Citations (713)", "departments": ["Curie Institute", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Curie Institute"], "authors": ["Laurent Jacob.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacob:Laurent", "Guillaume Obozinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obozinski:Guillaume", "Jean-Philippe Vert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vert:Jean=Philippe"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
