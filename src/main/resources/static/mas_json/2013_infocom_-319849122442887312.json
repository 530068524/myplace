The diffusion of innovation is modeled by the logit dynamics of a weighted N-person coordination game among (bounded) rational users where innovations spread through users' strategic choices. We find a critical asymptotic threshold for the weight on global information where the diffusion of innovations undergoes a transition in the rate of convergence regardless of any network structure. In particular, it is found that the convergence to the pervasive adoption is slowed down by global information.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "IBM"], "authors": ["Youngmi Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Youngmi", "Jungseul Ok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ok:Jungseul", "Yung Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Yung", "Jinwoo Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Jinwoo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
