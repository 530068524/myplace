The instances in a bag, however, are rarely independent in real tasks, and a better performance can be expected if the instances are treated in an non-i.i.d. way that exploits relations among instances. In this paper, we propose two simple yet effective methods. In the first method, we explicitly map every bag to an undirected graph and design a graph kernel for distinguishing the positive and negative bags. In the second method, we implicitly construct graphs by deriving affinity matrices and propose an efficient graph kernel considering the clique information. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are validated by experiments.", "citation": "Citations (241)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua", "Yu-Yin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yu=Yin", "Yu-Feng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yu=Feng"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
