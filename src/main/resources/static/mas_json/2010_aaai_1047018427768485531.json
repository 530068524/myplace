{"title": "Utilizing Context in Generative Bayesian Models for Linked Corpus.", "fields": ["open problem", "generative grammar", "citation", "phenomenon", "context model"], "abstract": "In an interlinked corpus of documents, the context in which a citation appears provides extra information about the cited document. However, associating terms in the context to the cited document remains an open problem. We propose a novel document generation approach that statistically incorporates the context in which a document links to another document. We quantitatively show that the proposed generation scheme explains the linking phenomenon better than previous approaches. The context information along with the actual content of the document provides signicant improvements over the previous approaches for various real world evaluation tasks such as link prediction and log-likelihood estimation on unseen content. The proposed method is more scalable to large collection of documents compared to the previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Saurabh Kataria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kataria:Saurabh", "Prasenjit Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Prasenjit", "Sumit Bhatia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatia:Sumit"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
