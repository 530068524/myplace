We consider the task of answering counterfactual questions such as, \"Would this patient have lower blood sugar had she received a different medication?\". We propose a new algorithmic framework for counterfactual inference which brings together ideas from domain adaptation and representation learning. In addition to a theoretical justification, we perform an empirical comparison with previous approaches to causal inference from observational data. Our deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Chalmers University of Technology", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Fredrik D.
