The risk of such approaches however, is their sensitivity to large margin losses due to the influence from noisy training examples and outliers which is a common problem in the area of affective computing (i.e., manual coding at the frame level is tedious so coarse labels are normally assigned). In this paper, we leverage the relaxation of the parallel-hyperplanes constraint and propose the use of modified correlation filters (MCF). The MCF is similar in spirit to SVMs and correlation filters, but with the key difference of optimizing only a single hyperplane. We demonstrate the superiority of MCF over current techniques on a battery of experiments.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Disney Research", "Queensland University of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sien W.
