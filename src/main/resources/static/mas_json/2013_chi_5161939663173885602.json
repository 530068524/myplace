{"title": "Everyday activities and energy consumption: how families understand the relationship.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "environmental resource management", "energy consumption", "computer science"], "abstract": "Energy consumption is a growing concern and it is important to inform families of their consumption and how they might reduce it. We conducted an interview study that focuses on the existing routines of families and how they currently understand their power and gas consumption based on standard utility bills. We also investigated how this understanding ties to their everyday activities as might be recorded on their calendars. This allowed us to assess calendars as an artifact for energy consumption awareness. Our results show that many people relate changes in energy consumption to high-level effects such as weather and temperature and not necessarily their own everyday activities. Events on calendars may aid this understanding but people do not currently record enough information on their calendars to make a strong tie. This suggests that if calendars are to be used as artifacts to aid energy consumption understanding, digital calendars need to provide support to include more energy-related information, including both activities and patterns of consumption.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Carman Neustaedter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neustaedter:Carman", "Lyn Bartram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartram:Lyn", "Aaron Mah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mah:Aaron"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
