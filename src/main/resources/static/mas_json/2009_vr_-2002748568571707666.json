The indoor environment is characterized by strong linear perspective cues; we attempted to re-create these cues in the outdoor environment. In the indoor environment, we found an overall pattern of underestimation of depth that is typical for virtual environments and AR systems. However, in the outdoor environment, we found that subjects overestimated depth. In addition, our synthetic linear perspective cues met with a measure of success, leading users to reduce their estimate of the depth of distant objects. We describe the experimental procedure, analyze the data, present the results of the study, and discuss the implications for mobile, outdoor AR systems.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "Mississippi State University", "Pacific Science ... fic-science.com"], "authors": ["Mark A.
