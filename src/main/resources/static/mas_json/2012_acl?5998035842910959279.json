{"title": "PDTB-style Discourse Annotation of Chinese Text.", "fields": ["czech", "treebank", "hindi", "annotation", "turkish"], "abstract": "We describe a discourse annotation scheme for Chinese and report on the preliminary results. Our scheme, inspired by the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB), adopts the lexically grounded approach; at the same time, it makes adaptations based on the linguistic and statistical characteristics of Chinese text. Annotation results show that these adaptations work well in practice. Our scheme, taken together with other PDTB-style schemes (e.g. for English, Turkish, Hindi, and Czech), affords a broader perspective on how the generalized lexically grounded approach can flesh itself out in the context of cross-linguistic annotation of discourse relations.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Brandeis University", "Brandeis University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yuping Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yuping", "Nianwen Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Nianwen"], "pages": 9}
