To realize these benefits automatically, we describe iThreads, a threading library for parallel incremental computation. iThreads supports unmodified shared-memory multithreaded programs: it can be used as a replacement for pthreads by a simple exchange of dynamically linked libraries, without even recompiling the application code. To enable such an interface, we designed algorithms and an implementation to operate at the compiled binary code level by leveraging MMU-assisted memory access tracking and process-based thread isolation. Our evaluation on a multicore platform using applications from the PARSEC and Phoenix benchmarks and two case-studies shows significant performance gains.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Max Planck Society", "University of Lisbon"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Pramod Bhatotia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatotia:Pramod", "Pedro Fonseca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fonseca_0001:Pedro", "Umut A.
