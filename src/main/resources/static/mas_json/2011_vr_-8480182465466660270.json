For example, previous work has shown that users tend to underestimate travel distances in immersive virtual environments (VEs). As a solution to this problem, some researchers propose to scale the mapped virtual camera motion relative to the tracked real-world movement of a user until real and virtual motion appear to match, i. e., real-world movements could be mapped with a larger gain to the VE in order to compensate for the underestimation. Although this approach usually results in more accurate self-motion judgments by users, introducing discrepancies between real and virtual motion can become a problem, in particular, due to misalignments of both worlds and distorted space cognition. In this paper we describe a different approach that introduces apparent self-motion illusions by manipulating optic flow fields during movements in VEs. These manipulations can affect self-motion perception in VEs, but omit a quantitative discrepancy between real and virtual motions. We introduce four illusions and show in experiments that optic flow manipulation can significantly affect users' self-motion judgments. Furthermore, we show that with such manipulation of optic flow fields the underestimation of travel distances can be compensated.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of M\u00fcnster", "Visualization a ... ity of Mu\u00a8nster", "Visualization a ... ity of Mu\u00a8nster"], "authors": ["Gerd Bruder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruder:Gerd", "Frank Steinicke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinicke:Frank", "Phil Wieland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wieland:Phil"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2011", "pages": 8}
