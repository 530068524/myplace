BodyScape reflects the relationship between users and their environment, specifically how different body parts enhance or restrict movement within particular interaction techniques and can be used to analyze existing techniques or suggest new ones. We illustrate the use of BodyScape by comparing two free-hand techniques, on-body touch and mid-air pointing, first separately, then combined. We found that touching the torso is faster than touching the lower legs, since it affects the user's balance; and touching targets on the dominant arm is slower than targets on the torso because the user must compensate for the applied force.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud"], "authors": ["Julie Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner:Julie", "Mathieu Nancel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nancel:Mathieu", "Sean Gustafson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gustafson:Sean", "St\u00e9phane Huot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huot:St=eacute=phane", "Wendy E.
