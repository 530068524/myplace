It typically requires the definition of a similarity measure between the classes of objects to be matched. Instead, we develop an approach which is able to perform matching by requiring a similarity measure only within each of the classes. This is achieved by maximizing the dependency between matched pairs of observations by means of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. This problem can be cast as one of maximizing a quadratic assignment problem with special structure and we present a simple algorithm for finding a locally optimal solution.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Yahoo!", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "NICTA", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Novi Quadrianto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quadrianto:Novi", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le", "Alexander J.
