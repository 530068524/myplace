This reveals important structures hidden by conventional algebraic presentations, and allows novel proofs of correctness via local topological operations, giving for the first time a satisfying high-level explanation for why these procedures work. We also investigate generalizations of these algorithms, providing improved analyses of those already in the literature, and a new generalization of the single-shot Grover algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Jamie Vicary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vicary:Jamie"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
