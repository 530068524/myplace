{"title": "Columnstore and B+ tree - Are Hybrid Physical Designs Important?", "fields": ["analytics", "b tree", "transaction processing", "database engine", "online transaction processing"], "abstract": "Commercial DBMSs, such as Microsoft SQL Server, cater to diverse workloads including transaction processing, decision support, and operational analytics. They also support variety in physical design structures such as B+ tree and columnstore. The benefits of B+ tree for OLTP workloads and columnstore for decision support workloads are well-understood. However, the importance of hybrid physical designs, consisting of both columnstore and B+ tree indexes on the same database, is not well-studied --- a focus of this paper. We first quantify the trade-offs using carefully-crafted micro-benchmarks. This micro-benchmarking indicates that hybrid physical designs can result in orders of magnitude better performance depending on the workload. For complex real-world applications, choosing an appropriate combination of columnstore and B+ tree indexes for a database workload is challenging. We extend the Database Engine Tuning Advisor for Microsoft SQL Server to recommend a suitable combination of B+ tree and columnstore indexes for a given workload. Through extensive experiments using industry-standard benchmarks and several real-world customer workloads, we quantify how a physical design tool capable of recommending hybrid physical designs can result in orders of magnitude better execution costs compared to approaches that rely either on columnstore-only or B+ tree-only designs.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Washington", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Adam Dziedzic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dziedzic:Adam", "Jingjing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingjing", "Sudipto Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Sudipto", "Bolin Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Bolin", "Vivek R.
