{"title": "Unweighted Coalitional Manipulation under the Borda Rule Is NP-Hard.", "fields": ["open problem", "voting", "discrete mathematics", "computational complexity theory", "scoring rule"], "abstract": "The Borda voting rule is a positional scoring rule where, for m candidates, for every vote the first candidate receives m- 1 points, the second m- 2 points and so on. A Borda winner is a candidate with highest total score. It has been a prominent open problem to determine the computational complexity of UNWEIGHTED COALITIONAL MANIPULATION UNDER BORDA: Can one add a certain number of additional votes (called manipulators) to an election such that a distinguished candidate becomes a winner? We settle this open problem by showing NP-hardness even for two manipulators and three input votes. Moreover, we discuss extensions and limitations of this hardness result.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Nadja Betzler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Betzler:Nadja", "Rolf Niedermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niedermeier:Rolf", "Gerhard J.
