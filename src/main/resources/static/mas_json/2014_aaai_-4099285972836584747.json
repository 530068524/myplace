{"title": "Recommendation by Mining Multiple User Behaviors with Group Sparsity.", "fields": ["recommender system", "matrix decomposition", "matrix", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Recently, some recommendation methods try to improve the prediction results by integrating information from user's multiple types of behaviors. How to model the dependence and independence between different behaviors is critical for them. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation model, the Group-Sparse Matrix Factorization (GSMF), which factorizes the rating matrices for multiple behaviors into the user and item latent factor space with group sparsity regularization. It can (1) select out the different subsets of latent factors for different behaviors, addressing that users' decisions on different behaviors are determined by different sets of factors; (2) model the dependence and independence between behaviors by learning the shared and private factors for multiple behaviors automatically; (3) allow the shared factors between different behaviors to be different, instead of all the behaviors sharing the same set of factors. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that our model can integrate users' multiple types of behaviors into recommendation better, compared with other state-of-the-arts.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Ting Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Ting", "Jian Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng_0001:Jian", "Xi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xi", "Shuang Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu_0002:Shuang", "Hanqing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hanqing"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
