We measured the saliency by integrating three elements as follows: the dissimilarities between image patches, which were evaluated in the reduced dimensional space, the spatial distance between image patches and the central bias. The dissimilarities were inversely weighted based on the corresponding spatial distance. A weighting mechanism, indicating a bias for human fixations to the center of the image, was employed. The principal component analysis (PCA) was the dimension reducing method used in our system. We extracted the principal components (PCs) by sampling the patches from the current image. Our method was compared with four saliency detection approaches using three image datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on predicting human fixations.", "citation": "Citations (198)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Beijing University of Technology", "Beijing University of Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Surrey"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Lijuan Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Lijuan", "Chunpeng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Chunpeng", "Jun Miao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miao:Jun", "Laiyun Qing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qing:Laiyun", "Yu Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Yu"], "pages": 8}
