{"title": "A comparison of the optimality of statistical significance tests for information retrieval evaluation.", "fields": ["wilcoxon signed rank test", "exact test", "student s t test", "sign test", "resampling"], "abstract": "Previous research has suggested the permutation test as the theoretically optimal statistical significance test for IR evaluation, and advocated for the discontinuation of the Wilcoxon and sign tests. We present a large-scale study comprising nearly 60 million system comparisons showing that in practice the bootstrap, t-test and Wilcoxon test outperform the permutation test under different optimality criteria. We also show that actual error rates seem to be lower than the theoretically expected 5%, further confirming that we may actually be underestimating significance.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Carlos III Health Institute", "Carlos III Health Institute", "Technical University of Madrid"], "authors": ["Juli\u00e1n Urbano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urbano:Juli=aacute=n", "M\u00f3nica Marrero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marrero:M=oacute=nica", "Diego Mart\u00edn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mart=iacute=n_0001:Diego"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
