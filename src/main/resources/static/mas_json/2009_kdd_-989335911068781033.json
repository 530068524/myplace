Recent empirical evidence has strongly suggested that the simple nearest neighbor algorithm is very difficult to beat for most time series problems. While this may be considered good news, given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor algorithm, there are some negative consequences of this. First, the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storing and searching the entire dataset, resulting in a time and space complexity that limits its applicability, especially on resource-limited sensors. Second, beyond mere classification accuracy, we often wish to gain some insight into the data.   In this work we introduce a new time series primitive, time series shapelets, which addresses these limitations. Informally, shapelets are time series subsequences which are in some sense maximally representative of a class. As we shall show with extensive empirical evaluations in diverse domains, algorithms based on the time series shapelet primitives can be interpretable, more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art classifiers.", "citation": "Citations (514)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside"], "authors": ["Lexiang Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Lexiang", "Eamonn J.
