{"title": "General Tensor Spectral Co-clustering for Higher-Order Data.", "fields": ["spectral clustering", "ground truth", "tensor", "biclustering", "row"], "abstract": "Spectral clustering and co-clustering are well-known techniques in data analysis, and recent work has extended spectral clustering to square, symmetric tensors and hypermatrices derived from a network. We develop a new tensor spectral co-clustering method that simultaneously clusters the rows, columns, and slices of a nonnegative three-mode tensor and generalizes to tensors with any number of modes. The algorithm is based on a new random walk model which we call the super-spacey random surfer. We show that our method out-performs state-of-the-art co-clustering methods on several synthetic datasets with ground truth clusters and then use the algorithm to analyze several real-world datasets.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Stanford University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Tao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Tao", "Austin R.
