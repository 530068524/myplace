The goal of the ResearchWiki is to enable greater transparency in the work of the organization and to provide a basis for broader collaboration among researchers. We motivate the design based on results from 40 interviews and discuss two cycles of usage of the ResearchWiki based on analyses of logs and an additional 20 interviews. We conclude with a discussion of the interplay of technology, work practice and organizational change and with design recommendations.", "citation": "Citations (119)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Catalina Danis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danis:Catalina", "David Singer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singer:David"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
