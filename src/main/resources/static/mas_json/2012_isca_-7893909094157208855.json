{"title": "LOT-ECC: Localized and tiered reliability mechanisms for commodity memory systems.", "fields": ["interleaved memory", "registered memory", "memory protection", "memory controller", "dimm"], "abstract": "Memory system reliability is a serious and growing concern in modern servers. Existing chipkill-level memory protection mechanisms suffer from several drawbacks. They activate a large number of chips on every memory access -- this increases energy consumption, and reduces performance due to the reduction in rank-level parallelism. Additionally, they increase access granularity, resulting in wasted bandwidth in the absence of sufficient access locality. They also restrict systems to use narrow-I/O x4 devices, which are known to be less energy-efficient than the wider x8 DRAM devices. In this paper, we present LOT-ECC, a localized and multi-tiered protection scheme that attempts to solve these problems. We separate error detection and error correction functionality, and employ simple checksum and parity codes effectively to provide strong fault-tolerance, while simultaneously simplifying implementation. Data and codes are localized to the same DRAM row to improve access efficiency. We use system firmware to store correction codes in DRAM data memory and modify the memory controller to handle data mapping. We thus build an effective fault-tolerance mechanism that provides strong reliability guarantees, activates as few chips as possible (reducing power consumption by up to 44.8% and reducing latency by up to 46.9%), and reduces circuit complexity, all while working with commodity DRAMs and operating systems. Finally, we propose the novel concept of a heterogeneous DIMM that enables the extension of LOT-ECC to x16 and wider DRAM parts.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Utah", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "Hewlett-Packard"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Aniruddha N.
