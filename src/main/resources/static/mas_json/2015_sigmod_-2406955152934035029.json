{"title": "Distributed Online Tracking.", "fields": ["error threshold", "data set", "online algorithm", "competitive analysis", "observer"], "abstract": "In online tracking, an observer  S  receives a sequence of values, one per time instance, from a data source that is described by a function  f . A tracker  T  wants to continuously maintain an approximation that is within an error threshold of the value  f ( t ) at any time instance  t , with small communication overhead. This problem was recently formalized and studied, and a principled approach with optimal competitive ratio was proposed. This work extends the study of online tracking to a distributed setting, where a tracker T wants to track a function f that is computed from a set of functions  f 1 , . . . ,  f m   from  m  distributed observers and respective data sources. This formulation finds numerous important and natural applications, e.g., sensor networks, distributed systems, measurement networks, and pub-sub systems. We formalize this problem and present effective online algorithms for various topologies of a distributed system/network for different aggregate functions. Experiments on large real data sets demonstrate the excellent performance of our methods in practice.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mingwang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Mingwang", "Feifei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Feifei", "Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei"], "pages": 15}
