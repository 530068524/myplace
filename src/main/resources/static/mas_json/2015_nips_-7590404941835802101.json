{"title": "Interpolating Convex and Non-Convex Tensor Decompositions via the Subspace Norm.", "fields": ["matrix norm", "regular polygon", "subspace topology", "estimator", "kronecker delta"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of recovering a low-rank tensor from its noisy observation. Previous work has shown a recovery guarantee with signal to noise ratio O(n[K/2]/2) for recovering a Kth order rank one tensor of size n x \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 x n by recursive unfolding. In this paper, we first improve this bound to O(nK/4) by a much simpler approach, but with a more careful analysis. Then we propose a new norm called the subspace norm, which is based on the Kronecker products of factors obtained by the proposed simple estimator. The imposed Kronecker structure allows us to show a nearly ideal O(\u221an + \u221aHK-1) bound, in which the parameter H controls the blend from the non-convex estimator to mode-wise nuclear norm minimization. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that the subspace norm achieves the nearly ideal denoising performance even with H = O(1).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Qinqing Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Qinqing", "Ryota Tomioka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomioka:Ryota"], "pages": 8}
