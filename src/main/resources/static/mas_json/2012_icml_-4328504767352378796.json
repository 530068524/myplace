When the agent is bounded by information-processing constraints, it can only keep an approximation of the belief. We present a variational principle for the problem of maintaining the information which is most useful for minimizing the cost, and introduce an efficient and simple algorithm for finding an optimum.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Roy Fox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fox:Roy", "Naftali Tishby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tishby:Naftali"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
