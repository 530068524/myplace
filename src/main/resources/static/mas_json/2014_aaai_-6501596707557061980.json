{"title": "Hybrid Heterogeneous Transfer Learning through Deep Learning.", "fields": ["deep learning", "feature learning", "pattern recognition", "transfer of learning", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Most previous heterogeneous transfer learning methods learn a cross-domain feature mapping between heterogeneous feature spaces based on a few cross-domain instance-correspondences, and these corresponding instances are assumed to be representative in the source and target domains respectively. However, in many real-world scenarios, this assumption may not hold. As a result, the constructed feature mapping may not be precise due to the bias issue of the correspondences in the target or (and) source domain(s). In this case, a classifier trained on the labeled transformed-source-domain data may not be useful for the target domain. In this paper, we present a new transfer learning framework called Hybrid Heterogeneous Transfer Learning (HHTL), which allows the corresponding instances across domains to be biased in either the source or target domain. Specifically, we propose a deep learning approach to learn a feature mapping between cross-domain heterogeneous features as well as a better feature representation for mapped data to reduce the bias issue caused by the cross-domain correspondences. Extensive experiments on several multilingual sentiment classification tasks verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with some baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Queensland", "Institute for I ... rch, Singapore"], "authors": ["Joey Tianyi Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Joey_Tianyi", "Sinno Jialin Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Sinno_Jialin", "Ivor W.
