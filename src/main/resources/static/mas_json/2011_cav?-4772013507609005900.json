{"title": "KLOVER: A Symbolic Execution and Automatic Test Generation Tool for C++ Programs.", "fields": ["usable", "manual testing", "unit testing", "code coverage", "interfacing"], "abstract": "We present the first symbolic execution and automatic test generation tool for C++ programs. First we describe our effort in extending an existing symbolic execution tool for C programs to handle C++ programs. We then show how we made this tool generic, efficient and usable to handle real-life industrial applications. Novel features include extended symbolic virtual machine, library optimization for C and C++, object-level execution and reasoning, interfacing with specific type of efficient solvers, and semi-automatic unit and component testing. This tool is being used to assist the validation and testing of industrial software as well as publicly available programs written using the C++ language.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Fujitsu", "Fujitsu", "Fujitsu"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Guodong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Guodong", "Indradeep Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Indradeep", "Sreeranga P.
