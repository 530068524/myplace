The main tools we introduce to obtain our results are (i) the use of fast approximate SVD-like decompositions for column-based matrix reconstruction, and (ii) two deterministic algorithms for selecting rows from matrices with orthonormal columns, building upon the sparse representation theorem for decompositions of the identity that appeared in [J.
