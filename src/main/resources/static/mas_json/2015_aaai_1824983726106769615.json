{"title": "Egalitarian Collective Decision Making under Qualitative Possibilistic Uncertainty: Principles and Characterization.", "fields": ["ranking", "possibility theory", "ordinal number", "pareto principle", "axiom"], "abstract": "This paper raises the question of collective decision making under possibilistic uncertainty; We study four egalitarian decision rules and show that in the context of a possibilistic representation of uncertainty, the use of an egalitarian collective utility function allows to get rid of the Timing Effect. Making a step further, we prove that if both the agents' preferences and the collective ranking of the decisions satisfy Dubois and Prade's axioms (1995), and particularly risk aversion, and Pareto Unanimity, then the egalitarian collective aggregation is compulsory. This result can be seen as an ordinal counterpart of Harsanyi's theorem (1955).", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de Gestion", "Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de Gestion", "University of Toulouse"], "authors": ["Nahla Ben Amor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amor:Nahla_Ben", "Fatma Essghaier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Essghaier:Fatma", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fargier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fargier:H=eacute=l=egrave=ne"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
