{"title": "Simplified parallel domain traversal.", "fields": ["tree traversal", "bottleneck", "scalability", "asynchronous communication", "parallel i o"], "abstract": "Many data-intensive scientific analysis techniques require global domain traversal, which over the years has been a bottleneck for efficient parallelization across distributed-memory architectures. Inspired by MapReduce and other simplified parallel programming approaches, we have designed  DStep , a flexible system that greatly simplifies efficient parallelization of domain traversal techniques at scale. In order to deliver both simplicity to users as well as scalability on HPC platforms, we introduce a novel two-tiered communication architecture for managing and exploiting asynchronous communication loads. We also integrate our design with advanced parallel I/O techniques that operate directly on native simulation output. We demonstrate DStep by performing teleconnection analysis across ensemble runs of terascale atmospheric CO 2  and climate data, and we show scalability results on up to 65,536 IBM BlueGene/P cores.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "Argonne National Laboratory", "University of Tennessee"], "authors": ["Wesley Kendall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kendall:Wesley", "Jingyuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingyuan", "Melissa Allen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allen:Melissa", "Tom Peterka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peterka:Tom", "Jian Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0007:Jian", "David Erickson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erickson:David"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2011", "pages": 11}
