{"title": "Proximate sensing: Inferring what-is-where from georeferenced photo collections.", "fields": ["land cover", "contextual image classification", "georeference", "training set", "proximate"], "abstract": "The primary and novel contribution of this work is the conjecture that large collections of georeferenced photo collections can be used to derive maps of what-is-where on the surface of the earth. We investigate the application of what we term \u201cproximate sensing\u201d to the problem of land cover classification for a large geographic region. We show that our approach is able to achieve almost 75% classification accuracy in a binary land cover labelling problem using images from a photo sharing site in a completely automated fashion. We also investigate 1) how existing geographic knowledge can be used to provide labelled training data in a weakly-supervised manner; 2) the effect of the photographer's intent when he or she captures the photograph; and 3) a method for filtering out non-informative images.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "University of California, Merced"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Daniel Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Daniel", "Shawn D.
