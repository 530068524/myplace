{"title": "Integrating Programming by Example and Natural Language Programming.", "fields": ["programming language implementation", "natural language programming", "fourth generation programming language", "programming domain", "very high level programming language"], "abstract": "We motivate the integration of programming by example and natural language programming by developing a system for specifying programs for simple text editing operations based on regular expressions. The programs are described with unconstrained natural language instructions, and providing one or more examples of input/output. We show that natural language allows the system to deduce the correct program much more often and much faster than is possible with the input/output example(s) alone, showing that natural language programming and programming by example can be combined in a way that overcomes the ambiguities that both methods suffer from individually and, at the same time, provides a more natural interface to the user.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Mehdi Hafezi Manshadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manshadi:Mehdi_Hafezi", "Daniel Gildea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gildea:Daniel", "James F.
