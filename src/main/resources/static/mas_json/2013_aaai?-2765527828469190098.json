{"title": "Gradient Networks: Explicit Shape Matching Without Extracting Edges.", "fields": ["active shape model", "template matching", "gradient network", "object detection", "traverse"], "abstract": "We present a novel framework for shape-based template matching in images. While previous approaches required brittle contour extraction, considered only local information, or used coarse statistics, we propose to match the shape explicitly on low-level gradients by formulating the problem as traversing paths in a gradient network. We evaluate our algorithm on a challenging dataset of objects in cluttered environments and demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods for shape matching and object detection.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Edward Hsiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsiao:Edward", "Martial Hebert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hebert:Martial"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
