{"title": "Discriminative Reordering Model Adaptation via Structural Learning.", "fields": ["phrase", "machine learning", "discriminative model", "nist", "machine translation"], "abstract": "Reordering model adaptation remains a big challenge in statistical machine translation because reordering patterns of translation units often vary dramatically from one domain to another. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive discriminative reordering model (DRM) based on structural learning, which can capture correspondences among reordering features from two different domains. Exploiting both in-domain and out-of-domain monolingual corpora, our model learns a shared feature representation for cross-domain phrase reordering. Incorporating features of this representation, the DRM trained on out-of-domain corpus generalizes better to in-domain data. Experiment results on the NIST Chinese-English translation task show that our approach significantly outperforms a variety of baselines.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Xiamen University", "Xiamen University", "Soochow University", "Xiamen University", "Xiamen University"], "authors": ["Biao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Biao", "Jinsong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Jinsong", "Deyi Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Deyi", "Hong Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Hong", "Junfeng Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Junfeng"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
