{"title": "Assessing Behavior Stage Progression From Social Media Data.", "fields": ["domain knowledge", "health policy", "social computing", "behavior change", "social media"], "abstract": "Important work rooted in psychological theory posits that health behavior change occurs through a series of discrete stages. Our work builds on the field of social computing by identifying how social media data can be used to resolve behavior stages at high resolution (e.g. hourly/daily) for key population subgroups and times. In essence this approach opens new opportunities to advance psychological theories and better understand how our health is shaped based on the real, dynamic, and rapid actions we make every day. To do so, we bring together domain knowledge and machine learning methods to form a hierarchical classification of Twitter data that resolves different stages of behavior. We identify and examine temporal patterns of the identified stages, with alcohol as a use case (planning or looking to drink, currently drinking, and reflecting on drinking). Known seasonal trends are compared with findings from our methods. We discuss the potential health policy implications of detecting high frequency behavior stages.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Boston Children's Hospital", "New York University"], "authors": ["Jiaxin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jiaxin", "Elissa R.
