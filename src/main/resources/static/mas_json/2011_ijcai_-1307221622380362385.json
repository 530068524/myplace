{"title": "Modeling Situation Awareness in Human-Like Agents Using Mental Models.", "fields": ["situation awareness", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In order for agents to be able to act intelligently in an environment, a first necessary step is to become aware of the current situation in the environment. Forming such awareness is not a trivial matter. Appropriate observations should be selected by the agent, and the observation results should be interpreted and combined into one coherent picture. Humans use dedicated mental models which represent the relationships between various observations and the formation of beliefs about the environment, which then again direct the further observations to be performed. In this paper, a generic agent model for situation awareness is proposed that is able to take a mental model as input, and utilize this model to create a picture of the current situation. In order to show the suitability of the approach, it has been applied within the domain of F-16 fighter pilot training for which a dedicated mental model has been specified, and simulations experiments have been conducted.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["VU University Amsterdam", "VU University Amsterdam", "VU University Amsterdam"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Mark Hoogendoorn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoogendoorn:Mark", "Rianne van Lambalgen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lambalgen:Rianne_van", "Jan Treur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Treur:Jan"], "pages": 8}
