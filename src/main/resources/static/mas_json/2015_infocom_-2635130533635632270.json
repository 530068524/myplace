By logging information transfer events we have characterized mobility patterns, and we have assessed the performance of services implemented using the FC paradigm. Our results unveil the key relevance of group dynamics in user movements for the FC performance. Surprisingly, in such an environment, our results show that a relatively low user density is enough to guarantee content persistence over time, contrarily to predictions from available models. Based on these experimental findings, we develop a novel simple analytical model that accounts for the peculiarities of the mobility patterns in such a setting, and that can accurately predict the effectiveness of FC for the implementation of services in a campus/large office setting.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["IMDEA", "IMDEA", "IMDEA", "HES SO Valais,  ... re, Switzerland"], "authors": ["Shahzad Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Shahzad", "Gianluca Rizzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rizzo:Gianluca", "Vincenzo Mancuso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancuso:Vincenzo", "Marco Ajmone Marsan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marsan:Marco_Ajmone"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
