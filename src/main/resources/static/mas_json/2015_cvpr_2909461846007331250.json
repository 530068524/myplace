Though stereo algorithms are well-studied, rarely are those algorithms considered solely in the context of producing these defocused renderings. In this paper we present a technique for efficiently producing disparity maps using a novel optimization framework in which inference is performed in \u201cbilateral-space\u201d. Our approach produces higher-quality \u201cdefocus\u201d results than other stereo algorithms while also being 10 \u2013 100\u00d7 faster than comparable techniques.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Google"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jonathan T.
