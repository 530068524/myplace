The proposed system is based on unsupervised learning of the normalization equivalences from unlabeled text. The proposed approach uses Random Walks on a contextual similarity bipartite graph constructed from n-gram sequences on large unlabeled text corpus. We show that the proposed approach has a very high precision of (92.43) and a reasonable recall of (56.4). When used as a preprocessing step for a state-of-the-art machine translation system, the translation quality on social media text improved by 6%. The proposed approach is domain and language independent and can be deployed as a preprocessing step for any NLP application to handle social media text.", "citation": "Citations (43)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hany Hassan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassan:Hany", "Arul Menezes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menezes:Arul"], "pages": 10}
