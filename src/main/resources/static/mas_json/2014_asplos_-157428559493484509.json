{"title": "Transactionalizing legacy code: an experience report using GCC and Memcached.", "fields": ["scratch", "exploit", "transactional memory", "collective intelligence", "legacy code"], "abstract": "The addition of transactional memory (TM) support to existing languages provides the opportunity to create new soft- ware from scratch using transactions, and also to simplify or extend legacy code by replacing existing synchronization with language-level transactions. In this paper, we describe our experiences transactionalizing the memcached application through the use of the GCC implementation of the Draft C++ TM Specification. We present experiences and recommendations that we hope will guide the effort to integrate TM into languages, and that may also contribute to the growing collective knowledge about how programmers can begin to exploit TM in existing production-quality software.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Lehigh University", "Lehigh University", "Lehigh University", "Lehigh University"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Wenjia Ruan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruan:Wenjia", "Trilok Vyas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vyas:Trilok", "Yujie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yujie", "Michael F.
