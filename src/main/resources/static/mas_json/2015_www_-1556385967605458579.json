The language consists of rules constraining and defining the structure of regions in the table. These regions are defined through the novel formalism of region selection expressions. We present a formal model for SCULPT and obtain a linear time combined complexity evaluation algorithm. In addition, we consider weak and strong streaming evaluation for SCULPT and present a SCULPT fragment for each of these streaming variants. Finally, we discuss several extensions of SCULPT including alternative semantics, types, complex content, and explore region selection expressions as a basis for a transformation language.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Bayreuth", "University of Hasselt", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles"], "authors": ["Wim Martens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martens:Wim", "Frank Neven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neven:Frank", "Stijn Vansummeren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vansummeren:Stijn"], "conf": "www", "year": "2015", "pages": 19}
