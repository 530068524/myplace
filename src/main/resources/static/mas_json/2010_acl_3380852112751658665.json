However, a careful comparison of different graph-based SSL algorithms on that task has been lacking. We compare three graph-based SSL algorithms for class-instance acquisition on a variety of graphs constructed from different domains. We find that the recently proposed MAD algorithm is the most effective. We also show that class-instance extraction can be significantly improved by adding semantic information in the form of instance-attribute edges derived from an independently developed knowledge base. All of our code and data will be made publicly available to encourage reproducible research in this area.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Google"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Partha Pratim Talukdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talukdar:Partha_Pratim", "Fernando C.
