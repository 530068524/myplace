This result gives a strong negative answer to an open problem of Lovett and Viola [CC 2012], who raised the question in the context of sampling distributions in low-level complexity classes.The conceptual implication is that the problem of proving lower bounds in the context ofsampling distributions requires ideas beyond thesensitivity-based structural results of Boppana [IPL 97]. We study the mapping a#x3C8; further and show that it (and its inverse) are computable in DLOGTIME-uniform TC0, but not in AC0. Moreover, we prove that a#x3C8; is \"approximately local\" in the sense that all but the last output bit of a#x3C8; are essentially determined by a single input bit.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Itai Benjamini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benjamini:Itai", "Gil Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Gil", "Igor Shinkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shinkar:Igor"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
