However, existing work on computer vision has not yet explored leveraging these signals to enhance egocentric video understanding. In this work, we propose a model for reasoning on multimodal data to jointly predict activities and energy expenditures. We use heart rate signals as privileged self-supervision to derive energy expenditure in a training stage. A multitask objective is used to jointly optimize the two tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dataset that contains 31 hours of egocentric video augmented with heart rate and acceleration signals. This study can lead to new applications such as a visual calorie counter.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Katsuyuki Nakamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakamura:Katsuyuki", "Serena Yeung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeung:Serena", "Alexandre Alahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alahi:Alexandre", "Li Fei-Fei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fei=Fei:Li"], "pages": 10}
