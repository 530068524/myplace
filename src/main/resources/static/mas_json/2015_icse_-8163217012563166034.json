{"title": "Dynamic Data Flow Testing of Object Oriented Systems.", "fields": ["test data generation", "test case", "test suite", "model based testing", "white box testing"], "abstract": "Data flow testing has recently attracted new interest in the context of testing object oriented systems, since data flow information is well suited to capture relations among the object states, and can thus provide useful information for testing method interactions. Unfortunately, classic data flow testing, which is based on static analysis of the source code, fails to identify many important data flow relations due to the dynamic nature of object oriented systems. In this paper, we propose a new technique to generate test cases for object oriented software. The technique exploits useful inter-procedural data flow information extracted dynamically from execution traces for object oriented systems. The technique is designed to enhance an initial test suite with test cases that exercise complex state based method interactions. The experimental results indicate that dynamic data flow testing can indeed generate test cases that exercise relevant behaviors otherwise missed by both the original test suite and by test suites that satisfy classic data flow criteria.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Giovanni Denaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denaro:Giovanni", "Alessandro Margara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Margara:Alessandro", "Mauro Pezz\u00e8.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pezz=egrave=:Mauro", "Mattia Vivanti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vivanti:Mattia"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
