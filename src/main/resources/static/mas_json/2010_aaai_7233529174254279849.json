Through this paper, we show that such representations allow for the inclusion of background knowledge that qualitatively describes a state and fan be used to design agents that demonstrate learning behavior in domains with large state and actions spaces such as computer games.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Shiwali Mohan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohan:Shiwali", "John E.
