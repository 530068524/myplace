{"title": "Reverse-Engineering the S-Box of Streebog, Kuznyechik and STRIBOBr1.", "fields": ["s box", "multiplexer", "block cipher", "hash function", "permutation"], "abstract": "The Russian Federation's standardization agency has recently published a hash function called Streebog and a 128-bit block cipher called Kuznyechik. Both of these algorithms use the same 8-bit S-Box but its design rationale was never made public.\n\nIn this paper, we reverse-engineer this S-Box and reveal its hidden structure. It is based on a sort of 2-round Feistel Network where exclusive-or is replaced by a finite field multiplication. This structure is hidden by two different linear layers applied before and after. In total, five different 4-bit S-Boxes, a multiplexer, two 8-bit linear permutations and two finite field multiplications in a field of size $$2^{4}$$ are needed to compute the S-Box.\n\nThe knowledge of this decomposition allows a much more efficient hardware implementation by dividing the area and the delay by 2.5 and 8 respectively. However, the small 4-bit S-Boxes do not have very good cryptographic properties. In fact, one of them has a probability 1 differential.\n\nWe then generalize the method we used to partially recover the linear layers used to whiten the core of this S-Box and illustrate it with a generic decomposition attack against 4-round Feistel Networks whitened with unknown linear layers. Our attack exploits a particular pattern arising in the Linear Approximations Table of such functions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Alex Biryukov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biryukov:Alex", "L\u00e9o Perrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perrin:L=eacute=o", "Aleksei Udovenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Udovenko:Aleksei"], "pages": 31}
