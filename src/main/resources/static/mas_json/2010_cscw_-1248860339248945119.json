{"title": "Three's company: understanding communication channels in three-way distributed collaboration.", "fields": ["distributed collaboration", "metaphor", "media space", "workspace", "channel"], "abstract": "We explore the design of a system for three-way collaboration over a shared visual workspace, specifically in how to support three channels of communication: person, reference, and task-space. In two studies, we explore the implications of extending designs intended for dyadic collaboration to three-person groups, and the role of each communication channel. Our studies illustrate the utility of multiple configurations of users around a distributed workspace, and explore the subtleties of traditional notions of identity, awareness, spatial metaphor, and corporeal embodiments as they relate to three-way collaboration.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Anthony Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Anthony", "Michel Pahud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pahud:Michel", "Kori Inkpen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inkpen:Kori", "Hrvoje Benko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benko:Hrvoje", "John C.
