{"title": "ARROW: GenerAting SignatuRes to Detect DRive-By DOWnloads.", "fields": ["drive by download", "honeypot", "exploit", "executable", "download"], "abstract": "A drive-by download attack occurs when a user visits a webpage which attempts to automatically download malware without the user's consent. Attackers sometimes use a  malware distribution network  (MDN) to manage a large number of malicious webpages, exploits, and malware executables. In this paper, we provide a new method to determine these MDNs from the secondary URLs and redirect chains recorded by a high-interaction client honeypot. In addition, we propose a novel drive-by download detection method. Instead of depending on the malicious content used by previous methods, our algorithm first identifies and then leverages the  URLs  of the MDN's  central servers , where a central server is a common server shared by a large percentage of the drive-by download attacks in the same MDN. A set of regular expression-based signatures are then generated based on the URLs of each central server. This method allows additional malicious webpages to be identified which launched but failed to execute a successful drive-by download attack. The new drive-by detection system named  ARROW  has been implemented, and we provide a large-scale evaluation on the output of a production drive-by detection system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where the detection coverage has been boosted by 96% with an extremely low false positive rate.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Junjie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Junjie", "Christian Seifert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seifert:Christian", "Jack W.
