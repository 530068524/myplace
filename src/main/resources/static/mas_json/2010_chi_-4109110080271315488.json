{"title": "Moving beyond untagging: photo privacy in a tagged world.", "fields": ["focus group", "internet privacy", "social network", "upload", "privacy software"], "abstract": "Photo tagging is a popular feature of many social network sites that allows users to annotate uploaded images with those who are in them, explicitly linking the photo to each person's profile. In this paper, we examine privacy concerns and mechanisms surrounding these tagged images. Using a focus group, we explored the needs and concerns of users, resulting in a set of design considerations for tagged photo privacy. We then designed a privacy enhancing mechanism based on our findings, and validated it using a mixed methods approach. Our results identify the social tensions that tagging generates, and the needs of privacy tools to address the social implications of photo privacy management.", "citation": "Citations (242)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["Andrew Besmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Besmer:Andrew", "Heather Richter Lipford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lipford:Heather_Richter"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
