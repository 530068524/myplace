An intuitive analysis using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process suggests that such averages are asymptotically normal. From a practical perspective, our SGD-based inference procedure is a first order method, and is well-suited for large scale problems. To show its merits, we apply it to both synthetic and real datasets, and demonstrate that its accuracy is comparable to classical statistical methods, while requiring potentially far less computation.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Rice University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Tianyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Tianyang", "Liu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Liu", "Anastasios Kyrillidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kyrillidis:Anastasios", "Constantine Caramanis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caramanis:Constantine"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
