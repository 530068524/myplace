{"title": "Going Gray, Failure to Hire, and the Ick Factor: Analyzing How Older Bloggers Talk about Ageism.", "fields": ["social psychology", "narrative", "computer supported cooperative work", "psychology", "collective action"], "abstract": "Ageism is a pervasive, and often invisible, form of discrimination. Though it can affect people of all ages, older adults in particular face age-related stereotypes and bias in their everyday lives. In this paper, we describe the ways in which older bloggers articulate a collective narrative on ageism as it appears in their lives, develop a community with anti-ageist interests, and discuss strategies to navigate and change societal views and institutions. Bloggers criticize stereotypical notions that focus exclusively on losses that occur with age and advocate a view that takes into account the complexity and positive aspects of older adulthood. This paper contributes a unique case of online collective action among older adults while drawing on their online discourse as a way of understanding what ageism means for CSCW.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Amanda Lazar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazar:Amanda", "Mark Diaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diaz:Mark", "Robin Brewer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brewer:Robin", "Chelsea Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Chelsea", "Anne Marie Piper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piper:Anne_Marie"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
