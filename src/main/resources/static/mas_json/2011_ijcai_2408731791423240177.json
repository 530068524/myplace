We define a PSAT normal form, based on which we propose two logic-based algorithms: a reduction of normal form PSAT instances to SAT, and a linearalgebraic algorithmwith a logic-based column generation strategy. We conclude that both algorithms present a phase transition behaviour and that the latter has a much better performance.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "University of S\u00e3o Paulo"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Marcelo Finger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finger:Marcelo", "Glauber De Bona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bona:Glauber_De"], "pages": 6}
