This is the first improvement over the sparse-graph case of the long-standing O(m min{\u221am, n 2/3 }) running time bound due to Even and Tarjan [16]. By well-known reductions, this also establishes an O\u0303(m 107 )-time algorithm for the maximum-cardinality bipartite matching problem. That, in turn, gives an improvement over the celebrated O(m\u221an) running time bound of Hopcroft and Karp [25] whenever the input graph is sufficiently sparse. At a very high level, our results stem from acquiring a deeper understanding of interior-point methods - a powerful tool in convex optimization - in the context of flow problems, as well as, utilizing certain interplay between maximum flows and bipartite matchings.", "citation": "Citations (120)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Aleksander Madry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madry:Aleksander"], "pages": 10}
