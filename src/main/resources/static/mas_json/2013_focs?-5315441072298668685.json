In particular this yields a \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3 circuit of size exp(O(\u221a(d log d))) computing the d \u00d7 d determinant Det d . It also means that if we can prove a lower bound of exp(omega(\u221a(d log d))) on the size of any \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3-circuit computing the d \u00d7 d permanent Perm d  then we get super polynomial lower bounds for the size of any arithmetic branching program computing Perm d . We then give some further results pertaining to derandomizing polynomial identity testing and circuit lower bounds. The \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3 circuits that we construct have the property that (some of) the intermediate polynomials have degree much higher than d. Indeed such a counterintuitive construction is unavoidable - it is known that in any \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3 circuit C computing either Det d  or Perm_d, if every multiplication gate has fanin at most d (or any constant multiple thereof) then C must have size at least exp(\u03a9(d)).", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Chennai Math.
