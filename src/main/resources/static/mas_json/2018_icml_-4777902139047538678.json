{"title": "QMIX: Monotonic Value Function Factorisation for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.", "fields": ["micromanagement", "reinforcement learning", "exploit", "monotonic function", "bellman equation"], "abstract": "In many real-world settings, a team of agents must coordinate their behaviour while acting in a decentralised way. At the same time, it is often possible to train the agents in a centralised fashion in a simulated or laboratory setting, where global state information is available and communication constraints are lifted. Learning joint action-values conditioned on extra state information is an attractive way to exploit centralised learning, but the best strategy for then extracting decentralised policies is unclear. Our solution is QMIX, a novel value-based method that can train decentralised policies in a centralised end-to-end fashion. QMIX employs a network that estimates joint action-values as a complex non-linear combination of per-agent values that condition only on local observations. We structurally enforce that the joint-action value is monotonic in the per-agent values, which allows tractable maximisation of the joint action-value in off-policy learning, and guarantees consistency between the centralised and decentralised policies. We evaluate QMIX on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, and show that QMIX significantly outperforms existing value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Russian-Armenian University"], "authors": ["Tabish Rashid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rashid:Tabish", "Mikayel Samvelyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samvelyan:Mikayel", "Christian Schr\u00f6der de Witt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Witt:Christian_Schr=ouml=der_de", "Gregory Farquhar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farquhar:Gregory", "Jakob N.
