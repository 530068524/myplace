Due to their low complexity, desirable properties and relative ease of understanding, wavelet based techniques are often used for both synopsis construction and anomaly detection. In streaming data literature, Mallat's algorithm [1] is often used to achieve a Haar wavelet decomposition in O(n) time. However, there is one limitation to this popular technique, in that it leads to a dyadic decomposition of data. We demonstrate that the property of non-dyadicity is of considerable use in synopsis construction and anomaly detection. In this regard we present several application results, a synopsis data structure for streaming data that is an order of magnitude superior to the popular Haar based wavelet technique, a method for finding anomalies for sensor data over non-dyadic hierarchies, etc. In our work, we enable non-dyadicity by proposing a Mallat like construction for a wavelet system that admits non-dyadic basis. Our algorithm builds a non-dyadic hierarchical structure, and is more efficient than the state of the art construction. We prove the correctness of our construction by showing that our basis functions demonstrates the properties of a wavelet system.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Chetan Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Chetan", "Choudur Lakshminarayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lakshminarayan:Choudur", "Song Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Song", "Abhay Mehta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehta:Abhay"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
