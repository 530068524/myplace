This paper addresses automatic unit test generation for programs written in C/C++. The main idea is to improve the coverage obtained by feedback-directed random test generation methods, by utilizing concolic execution on the generated test drivers. Furthermore, for programs with numeric computations, we employ non-linear solvers in a lazy manner to generate new test inputs. These techniques significantly improve the coverage provided by a feedback-directed random unit testing framework, while retaining the benefits of full automation. We have implemented these techniques in a prototype platform, and describe promising experimental results on a number of C/C++ open source benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Pranav Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg_0001:Pranav", "Franjo Ivancic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ivancic:Franjo", "Gogul Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Gogul", "Naoto Maeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maeda:Naoto", "Aarti Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Aarti"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
