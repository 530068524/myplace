{"title": "Distance-Bounding Protocols: Verification without Time and Location.", "fields": ["cryptographic protocol", "bounding overwatch", "correctness", "formal verification", "timestamp"], "abstract": "Distance-bounding protocols are cryptographic protocols that securely establish an upper bound on the physical distance between the participants. Existing symbolic verification frameworks for distance-bounding protocols consider timestamps and the location of agents. In this work we introduce a causality-based characterization of secure distance-bounding that discards the notions of time and location. This allows us to verify the correctness of distance-bounding protocols with standard protocol verification tools. That is to say, we provide the first fully automated verification framework for distance-bounding protocols. By using our framework, we confirmed known vulnerabilities in a number of protocols and discovered unreported attacks against two recently published protocols.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Sjouke Mauw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mauw:Sjouke", "Zach Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Zach", "Jorge Toro-Pozo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toro=Pozo:Jorge", "Rolando Trujillo-Rasua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trujillo=Rasua:Rolando"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2018", "pages": 18}
