{"title": "On the Extraction of One Maximal Information Subset That Does Not Conflict with Multiple Contexts.", "fields": ["boolean algebra", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The efficient extraction of one maximal information subset that does not conflict with multiple contexts or additional information sources is a key basic issue in many A.I. domains, especially when these contexts or sources can be mutually conflicting. In this paper, this question is addressed from a computational point of view in clausal Boolean logic. A new approach is introduced that experimentally outperforms the currently most efficient technique.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["\u00c9ric Gr\u00e9goire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=eacute=goire:=Eacute=ric", "Yacine Izza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izza:Yacine", "Jean-Marie Lagniez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lagniez:Jean=Marie"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
