As corollaries, we also prove similar inapproximability results for Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a two-player incomplete information game with a constant number of actions, for relative e-Nash equilibrium in a two-player game, for market equilibrium in a non-monotone market, for the generalized circuit problem defined by Chen et al. [4], and for approximate competitive equilibrium from equal incomes with indivisible goods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Aviad Rubinstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubinstein:Aviad"], "pages": 10}
