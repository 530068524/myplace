Our approach is based on the concept of visual synset, which is an organization of images which are visually-similar and semantically-related. Each visual synset represents a single prototypical visual concept, and has an associated set of weighted annotations. Linear SVM's are utilized to predict the visual synset membership for unseen image examples, and a weighted voting rule is used to construct a ranked list of predicted annotations from a set of visual synsets. We demonstrate that visual synsets lead to better performance than standard methods on a new annotation database containing more than 200 million im- ages and 300 thousand annotations, which is the largest ever reported", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["David Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai_0002:David", "Yushi Jing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jing:Yushi", "Yi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yi", "Henry A.
