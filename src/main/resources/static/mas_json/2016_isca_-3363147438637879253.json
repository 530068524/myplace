{"title": "Rescuing Uncorrectable Fault Patterns in On-Chip Memories through Error Pattern Transformation.", "fields": ["soft error", "static random access memory", "memory errors", "general purpose computing on graphics processing units", "latency"], "abstract": "Voltage scaling can effectively reduce processor power, but also reduces the reliability of the SRAM cells in on-chip memories. Therefore, it is often accompanied by the use of an error correcting code (ECC). To enable reliable and efficient memory operation at low voltages, ECCs for on-chip memories must provide both high error coverage and low correction latency. In this paper, we propose error pattern transformation, a novel low-latency error correction technique that allows on-chip memories to be scaled to voltages lower than what has been previously possible. Our technique relies on the observation that the number of on-chip memory errors that many ECCs can correct differs widely depending on the error patterns in the logical words they protect. We propose adaptively rearranging the logical bit to physical bit mapping per word according to the BIST-detectable fault pattern in the physical word. The adaptive logical bit to physical bit mapping transforms many uncorrectable error patterns in the logical words into correctable error patterns and, therefore, improving on-chip memory reliability. This reduces the minimum voltage at which on-chip memory can run by 70mV over the best low-latency ECC baseline, leading to a 25.7% core-wide power reduction for an ARM Cortex-A7-like core. Energy per instruction is reduced by 15.7% compared to the best baseline.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Henry Duwe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duwe:Henry", "Xun Jian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jian:Xun", "Daniel Petrisko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrisko:Daniel", "Rakesh Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0002:Rakesh"], "pages": 11}
