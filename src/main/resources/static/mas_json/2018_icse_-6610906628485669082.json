{"title": "Nemo: multi-criteria test-suite minimization with integer nonlinear programming.", "fields": ["test case", "test suite", "integer programming", "code coverage", "integer"], "abstract": "Multi-criteria test-suite minimization aims to remove redundant test cases from a test suite based on some criteria such as code coverage, while trying to optimally maintain the capability of the reduced suite based on other criteria such as fault-detection effectiveness. Existing techniques addressing this problem with integer linear programming claim to produce optimal solutions. However, the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem is inherently nonlinear, due to the fact that test cases are often dependent on each other in terms of test-case criteria. In this paper, we propose a framework that formulates the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve this problem optimally, we programmatically transform this nonlinear problem into a linear one and then solve the problem using modern linear solvers. We have implemented our framework as a tool, called Nemo, that supports a number of modern linear and nonlinear solvers. We have evaluated Nemo with a publicly available dataset and minimization problems involving multiple criteria including statement coverage, fault-revealing capability, and test execution time. The experimental results show that Nemo can be used to efficiently find an optimal solution for multi-criteria test-suite minimization problems with modern solvers, and the optimal solutions outperform the suboptimal ones by up to 164.29% in terms of the criteria considered in the problem.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "authors": ["Jun-Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Jun=Wei", "Reyhaneh Jabbarvand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jabbarvand:Reyhaneh", "Joshua Garcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia:Joshua", "Sam Malek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malek:Sam"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
