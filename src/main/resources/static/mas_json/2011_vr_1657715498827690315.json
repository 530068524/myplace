The system improves on existing 3D multi-touch systems by working regardless of lighting conditions and supplying a working volume large enough for multiple users. Previous systems were limited either by environmental requirements, working volume, or computational resources necessary for realtime operation. By employing a time-of-flight camera, the system is capable of reliably recognizing gestures at the finger level in real-time at more than 50 fps with commodity computer hardware using our newly developed precision hand and finger-tracking algorithm. Building on this algorithm, the system performs gesture recognition with simple constraint modeling over statistical aggregations of the hand appearances in a working volume of more than 8 cubic meters. Two iterations of user tests were performed on a prototype system, demonstrating the feasibility and usability of the approach as well as providing first insights regarding the acceptance of true barehanded touch-based 3D interaction.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society"], "authors": ["Georg Hackenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hackenberg:Georg", "Rod McCall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCall:Rod", "Wolfgang Broll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broll:Wolfgang"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2011", "pages": 8}
