We videotaped 10 trauma resuscitations and transcribed each event. Using a framework that we developed, we coded each transcript to allow qualitative and quantitative analysis of the trauma teams' collaborative processes. We analyzed teams' tasks, interactions, and communication patterns that support information acquisition and sharing. Our results showed the importance of team transactive memory, but also pointed to inefficiencies in communication processes, which enable the functioning of this collective memory system. Based on quantitative and qualitative observations of trauma teamwork, we present opportunities for technological solutions that may reduce the cognitive effort needed for maintaining the working memory of trauma teams.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Children's National Medical Center"], "authors": ["Aleksandra Sarcevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarcevic:Aleksandra", "Ivan Marsic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marsic:Ivan", "Michael E.
