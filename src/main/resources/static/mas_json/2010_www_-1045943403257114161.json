Careful analysis of Web document streams holds enormous potential to solve longstanding problems in a variety of social science disciplines through massive data analysis. This paper introduces the TextMap Access system, which provides ready access to a wealth of interesting statistics on millions of people, places, and things across a number of interesting web corpora. Powered by a flexible and scalable distributed statistics computation framework using Hadoop, continually updated corpora include newspapers, blogs, patent records, legal documents, and scientific abstracts; well over a terabyte of raw text and growing daily. The Lydia Textmap Access system, available through http://www.textmap.com/access, provides instant access for students and scholars through a convenient web user-interface. We describe the architecture of the TextMap Access system, and its impact on current research in political science, sociology, and business/marketing.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Mikhail Bautin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bautin:Mikhail", "Charles B.
