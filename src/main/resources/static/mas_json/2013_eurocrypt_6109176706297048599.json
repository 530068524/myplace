These structural properties rely on a new bound on the degree of iterated permutations with a nonlinear layer composed of parallel applications of a number of balanced Sboxes. These techniques yield zero-sum partitions of size 21575 for the full Keccak-f permutation and several observations on the Luffa hash family. We first show that Luffa v1 applied to one-block messages is a function of 255 variables with degree at most 251. This observation leads to the construction of a higher-order differential distinguisher for the full Luffa v1 hash function, similar to the one presented by Watanabe et al. on a reduced version. We show that similar techniques can be used to find all-zero higher-order differentials in the Luffa v2 compression function, but the additional blank round destroys this property in the hash function.", "citation": "Citations (278)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Gemalto", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "University of Haifa", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Aalto University", "Middle East Technical University", "Middle East Technical University", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Polish Academy of Sciences", "Queensland University of Technology", "Polish Academy of Sciences", "FHNW, Windisch, Switzerland", "FHNW, Windisch, Switzerland", "University of Commerce"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Guido Bertoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertoni:Guido", "Joan Daemen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daemen:Joan", "Micha\u00ebl Peeters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peeters:Micha=euml=l", "Gilles Van Assche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Assche:Gilles_Van"], "pages": 2}
