We found that context does not make a difference but surprisingly, people completed interrupted tasks in less time with no difference in quality. Our data suggests that people compensate for interruptions by working faster, but this comes at a price: experiencing more stress, higher frustration, time pressure and effort. Individual differences exist in the management of interruptions: personality measures of openness to experience and need for personal structure predict disruption costs of interruptions. We discuss implications for how system design can support interrupted work.", "citation": "Citations (411)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Humboldt University of Berlin", "Humboldt University of Berlin"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gloria Mark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mark:Gloria", "Daniela Gudith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gudith:Daniela", "Ulrich Klocke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klocke:Ulrich"], "pages": 4}
