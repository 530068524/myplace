Here a saboteur chooses a PRG instance for which she knows a trapdoor that allows prediction of future (and possibly past) generator outputs. This topic was formally studied by Vazirani and Vazirani, but only in a limited form and not in the context of subverting cryptographic protocols. The latter has become increasingly important due to revelations about NIST\u2019s backdoored Dual EC PRG and new results about its practical exploitability using a trapdoor.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "Cornell University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Yevgeniy Dodis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodis:Yevgeniy", "Chaya Ganesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganesh:Chaya", "Alexander Golovnev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovnev:Alexander", "Ari Juels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juels:Ari", "Thomas Ristenpart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ristenpart:Thomas"], "pages": 26}
