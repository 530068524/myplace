{"title": "Adaptive placement and migration policy for an STT-RAM-based hybrid cache.", "fields": ["resistive random access memory", "static random access memory", "cache", "latency", "tag ram"], "abstract": "Emerging Non-Volatile Memories (NVM) such as Spin-Torque Transfer RAM (STT-RAM) and Resistive RAM (RRAM) have been explored as potential alternatives for traditional SRAM-based Last-Level-Caches (LLCs) due to the benefits of higher density and lower leakage power. However, NVM technologies have long latency and high energy overhead associated with the write operations. Consequently, a hybrid STT-RAM and SRAM based LLC architecture has been proposed in the hope of exploiting high density and low leakage power of STT-RAM and low write overhead of SRAM. Such a hybrid cache design relies on an intelligent block placement policy that makes good use of the characteristics of both STT-RAM and SRAM technology.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Peking University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Zhe Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhe", "Daniel A.
