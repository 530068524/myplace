Using simple charts, we tested how pictographic representations impact (1) memory for information just viewed, as well as under the load of additional information, (2) speed of finding information, and (3) engagement and preference in seeking out these visualizations. We find that superfluous images can distract. But we find no user costs -- and some intriguing benefits -- when pictographs are used to represent the data.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Tableau Softwar ... eattle, WA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Steve Haroz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haroz:Steve", "Robert Kosara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosara:Robert", "Steven L.
