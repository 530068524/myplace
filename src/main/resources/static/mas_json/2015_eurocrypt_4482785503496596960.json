{"title": "Robust Authenticated-Encryption AEZ and the Problem That It Solves.", "fields": ["ciphertext", "plaintext", "authenticated encryption", "computer science", "lambda", "round function", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "With a scheme for robust authenticated-encryption a user can select an arbitrary value \\(\\lambda \\!\\ge 0\\) and then encrypt a plaintext of any length into a ciphertext that\u2019s \\(\\lambda \\) characters longer. The scheme must provide all the privacy and authenticity possible for the requested \\(\\lambda \\). We formalize and investigate this idea, and construct a well-optimized solution, AEZ, from the AES round function. Our scheme encrypts strings at almost the same rate as OCB-AES or CTR-AES (on Haswell, AEZ has a peak speed of about 0.7 cpb). To accomplish this we employ an approach we call prove-then-prune: prove security and then instantiate with a scaled-down primitive (e.g., reducing rounds for blockcipher calls).", "citation": "Citations (101)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Georgetown University", "California State University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Viet Tung Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Viet_Tung", "Ted Krovetz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krovetz:Ted", "Phillip Rogaway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogaway:Phillip"], "pages": 30}
