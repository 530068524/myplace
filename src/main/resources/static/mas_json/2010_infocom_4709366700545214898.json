{"title": "A Greedy Link Scheduler for Wireless Networks with Gaussian Multiple Access and Broadcast Channels.", "fields": ["pooling", "throughput", "point to point", "tree network", "greedy algorithm"], "abstract": "Information-theoretic broadcast channels (BCs) and multiple-access channels (MACs) enable a single node to transmit data simultaneously to multiple nodes, and multiple nodes to transmit data simultaneously to a single node, respectively. In this paper, we address the problem of link scheduling in multihop wireless networks containing nodes with BC and MAC capabilities. We first propose an interference model that extends protocol interference models, originally designed for point-to-point channels, to include the possibility of BCs and MACs. Due to the high complexity of optimal link schedulers, we introduce the Multiuser Greedy Maximum Weight algorithm for link scheduling in multihop wireless networks containing BCs and MACs. Given a network graph, we develop new local pooling conditions and show that the performance of our algorithm can be fully characterized using the associated parameter, the multiuser local pooling factor. We provide examples of some network graphs, on which we apply local pooling conditions and derive the multiuser local pooling factor. We prove optimality of our algorithm in tree networks and show that the exploitation of BCs and MACs improve the throughput performance considerably in multihop wireless networks.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Middle East Technical University", "Electr. & Elect ...
