{"title": "Extension Enforcement in Abstract Argumentation as an Optimization Problem.", "fields": ["operator", "enforcement", "argumentation theory", "optimization problem", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Change in abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) is a very active topic. Especially, the problem of enforcing a set E of arguments, i.e., ensuring that E is an extension (or a subset of an extension) of a given AF F, has received a particular attention in the recent years. In this paper, we define a new family of enforcement operators, for which enforcement can be achieved by adding new arguments (and attacks) to F (as in previous approaches to enforcement), but also by questioning some attacks (and non-attacks) of F. This family includes previous enforcement operators, but also new ones for which the success of the enforcement operation is guaranteed. We show how the enforcement problem for the operators of the family can be modeled as a pseudo-Boolean optimization problem. Intensive experiments show that the method is practical and that it scales up well.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Sylvie Coste-Marquis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coste=Marquis:Sylvie", "S\u00e9bastien Konieczny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konieczny:S=eacute=bastien", "Jean-Guy Mailly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mailly:Jean=Guy", "Pierre Marquis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marquis:Pierre"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
