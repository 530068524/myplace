Large scale web services such as social networks are a major and growing database application area, but currently there are few benchmarks that accurately model web service workloads.   In this paper we present a new synthetic benchmark called LinkBench. LinkBench is based on traces from production databases that store \"social graph\" data at Facebook, a major social network. We characterize the data and query workload in many dimensions, and use the insights gained to construct a realistic synthetic benchmark. LinkBench provides a realistic and challenging test for persistent storage of social and web service data, filling a gap in the available tools for researchers, developers and administrators.", "citation": "Citations (175)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Timothy G.
