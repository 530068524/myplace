Such reductions allow one to leverage sophisticated classifiers for learning. These models are typically trained independently for each class using positive and negative examples cropped from images. At test-time, various post-processing heuristics such as non-maxima suppression (NMS) are required to reconcile multiple detections within and between different classes for each image. Though crucial to good performance on benchmarks, this post-processing is usually defined heuristically.", "citation": "Citations (456)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Chaitanya Desai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desai:Chaitanya", "Deva Ramanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanan:Deva", "Charless C.
