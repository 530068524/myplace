Our algorithm neither needs densely sampled views nor does it need a single visually connected path through all the views in the dataset. We use vision-based estimates of mutual rotation and translation between cameras to compute a measure of confidence on the correctness of the associated GPS and magnetometer tags. The vision algorithm can find the epipolar geometry between two wide-baseline images without needing pre-specified correspondences. We have two versions of our approach; one that requires geometric pose estimation between all pairs of images and a faster version that uses a pre-filter based on photometric comparison of images to quickly reject non-overlapping views from further geometric consideration. We show qualitative and quantitative results on the Nokia Grand Challenge 2010 Dataset. We find that magnetometer readings are more accurate than GPS readings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of South Florida", "University of South Florida"], "authors": ["Aveek Shankar Brahmachari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brahmachari:Aveek_Shankar", "Sudeep Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar:Sudeep"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
