{"title": "Gaussian Process Bandit Optimisation with Multi-fidelity Evaluations.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "fidelity", "regret", "gaussian process", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In many scientific and engineering applications, we are tasked with the optimisation of an expensive to evaluate black box function $\\func$. Traditional methods for this problem assume just the availability of this single function. However, in many cases, cheap approximations to $\\func$ may be obtainable. For example, the expensive real world behaviour of a robot can be approximated by a cheap computer simulation. We can use these approximations to eliminate low function value regions cheaply and use the expensive evaluations of $\\func$ in a small but promising region and speedily identify the optimum. We formalise this task as a \\emph{multi-fidelity} bandit problem where the target function and its approximations are sampled from a Gaussian process. We develop \\mfgpucb, a novel method based on upper confidence bound techniques. In our theoretical analysis we demonstrate that it exhibits precisely the above behaviour, and achieves better regret than strategies which ignore multi-fidelity information. \\mfgpucbs outperforms such naive strategies and other multi-fidelity methods on several synthetic and real experiments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Kirthevasan Kandasamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kandasamy:Kirthevasan", "Gautam Dasarathy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasarathy:Gautam", "Junier B.
