Understanding and predicting usefulness judgment are crucial for developing user-centric evaluation methods and providing contextualize results according to the search context. With a dataset collected in a laboratory user study, we systematically investigate the effects of a variety of content, context, and behavior factors on usefulness judgments and find that while user behavior factors are most important in determining usefulness judgments, content and context factors also have significant effects on it. We further adopt these factors as features to build prediction models for usefulness judgments. An AUC score of 0.909 in binary usefulness classification and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.694 in usefulness regression demonstrate the effectiveness of our models. Our study sheds light on the understanding of the dynamics of the user-perceived usefulness of documents in a search session and provides implications for the evaluation and design of Web search engines.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jiaxin Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Jiaxin", "Yiqun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yiqun", "Huan-Bo Luan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luan:Huan=Bo", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Min", "Shaoping Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shaoping", "Hengliang Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Hengliang", "Yuntao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yuntao"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
