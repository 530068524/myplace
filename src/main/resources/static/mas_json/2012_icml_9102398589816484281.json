It takes both the area and the nested nature of catchments into account. The main appeal of the method is that it is a best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) adapted for the case of stream networks without any addi- tional assumptions. The concept is built on the work of Sauquet et al. (2000) and extends it in a number of ways. We test the method for the case of the specific 100-year flood for two Austrian regions. The method provides more plausible and, indeed, more accurate estimates than Ordinary Kriging. For the variable of interest, Top-kriging also provides esti- mates of the uncertainty. On the main stream the estimated uncertainties are smallest and they gradually increase as one moves towards the headwaters. The method as presented here is able to exploit the information contained in short records by accounting for the uncertainty of each gauge. We suggest that Top-kriging can be used for spatially interpolat- ing a range of streamflow-related variables including mean annual discharge, flood characteristics, low flow characteris- tics, concentrations, turbidity and stream temperature.", "citation": "Citations (202)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki", "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Essex", "University of Essex", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Andrew Gordon Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Andrew_Gordon", "David A.
