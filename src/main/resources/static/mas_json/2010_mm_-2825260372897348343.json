We introduce a multimodal learning environment for social skills which uses computer vision to estimate the children's gaze direction, processes gestures from a large multi-touch screen, estimates in real time the affective state of the users, and generates interactive narratives with embodied virtual characters. We also describe how the structure underlying this system is currently being extended into a general framework for the development of interactive multimodal systems.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Heriot-Watt University", "Institute of Education", "Institute of Education", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Sussex"], "authors": ["Mary Ellen Foster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foster:Mary_Ellen", "Katerina Avramides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avramides:Katerina", "Sara Bernardini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernardini:Sara", "Jingying Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jingying", "Christopher Frauenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frauenberger:Christopher", "Oliver Lemon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lemon:Oliver", "Kaska Porayska-Pomsta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porayska=Pomsta:Kaska"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
