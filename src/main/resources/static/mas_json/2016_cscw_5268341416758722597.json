Families develop 'systems'   or methods through which they coordinate and manage their everyday financial activities. Through an analysis of our fieldwork data collected from fifteen families, we provide several examples of such systems, highlighting their qualities and illustrating how such systems come to support the handling of financial activities in the home. Our results show that these systems are developed with a careful consideration of familial values, relationships and routines; and incorporate the use of physical and digital tools. Consequently, we suggest that design should consider the use and non-use of technology when supporting household financial management, taking into account the richness of families\u00e2   existing organically formed practices surrounding financial systems. Finally, our findings point to the fact that financial management in the domestic setting is socially organized and is closely connected to supporting everyday household activities.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology"], "authors": ["Dhaval Vyas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vyas:Dhaval", "Stephen Snow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snow:Stephen", "Paul Roe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roe:Paul", "Margot Brereton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brereton:Margot"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
