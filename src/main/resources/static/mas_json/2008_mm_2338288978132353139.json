{"title": "A learner, is a learner, is a user, is a customer: QoS-based experience-aware adaptation.", "fields": ["quality of service", "real time computing", "quality of experience", "multimedia", "mobile qos"], "abstract": "This paper describes an outline of the doctoral thesis work concerning adaptation policies towards quality of experience (QoE) in performance-aware adaptive multimedia e-learning systems. QoE is considered to be mainly affected by the psychological concept of flow and learning-related factors. In turn, for multimedia systems, these factors can be heavily influenced by quality of service (QoS). In an ideal world, QoS would not be an issue and content optimally tailored to a user's needs could always be perfectly delivered. Unfortunately, delivery conditions are not always ideal, and it may be infeasible to deliver certain multimedia content such as high quality video while maintaining an acceptable QoS. The goal of this research is to balance the constraints imposed by QoS restrictions with the requirements of flow and learning in order to produce the highest possible QoE for the learner using an adaptive multimedia system.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Dublin City University"], "authors": ["Sabine Moebs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moebs:Sabine"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
