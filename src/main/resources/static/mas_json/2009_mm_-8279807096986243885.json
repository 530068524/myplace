This study examined how Deweyan concepts of learning can be applied to game play. The authors found that students developed a unique language to discuss real pollution issues within a fictional construct. Engaging in both civic engagement and educational rigor, student learning was situated in a framework of instruction John Dewey outlines as counter to traditional models of schooling. Despite limitations, including some authoritarian and competitive structures implicit in games, students found new reasons to communicate with real-world adults in verbal and written form. Game-based learning inspired substantial qualitative progress and high levels of engagement among students, compared to traditional teaching methods.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Greg Niemeyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niemeyer:Greg", "Antero Garcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia:Antero", "Reza Naima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naima:Reza"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
