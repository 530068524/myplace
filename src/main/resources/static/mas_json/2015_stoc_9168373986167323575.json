In 1991, Agrawal, Klein, and Ravi gave a primal-dual constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem. Until this work, the only constant-factor approximations we know are via linear programming relaxations.   In this paper, we consider the following greedy algorithm: Given terminal pairs in a metric space, a terminal is active if its distance to its partner is non-zero. Pick the two closest active terminals (say s i , t j ), set the distance between them to zero, and buy a path connecting them. Recompute the metric, and repeat.} It has long been open to analyze this greedy algorithm. Our main result shows that this algorithm is a constant-factor approximation.   We use this algorithm to give new, simpler constructions of cost-sharing schemes for Steiner forest. In particular, the first \"group-strict\" cost-shares for this problem implies a very simple combinatorial sampling-based algorithm for stochastic Steiner forest.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anupam Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Anupam", "Amit Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Amit"], "pages": 8}
