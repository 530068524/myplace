Given a set of data vectors, LRR seeks the lowest-rank representation among all the candidates that represent all vectors as the linear combination of the bases in a dictionary. Unlike the well-known sparse representation (SR), which computes the sparsest representation of each data vector individually, LRR aims at finding the lowest-rank representation of a collection of vectors jointly. LRR better captures the global structure of data, giving a more effective tool for robust subspace segmentation from corrupted data. Both theoretical and experimental results show that LRR is a promising tool for subspace segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (1,015)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Guangcan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Guangcan", "Zhouchen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhouchen", "Yong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yong"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
