{"title": "Generalizing ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT.", "fields": ["mathematics", "search algorithm", "artificial intelligence", "generalization", "machine learning"], "abstract": "ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT are two optimal DCOP search algorithms that are similar except for their search strategies: the former uses best-first search and the latter uses depth-first branch-and-bound search. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, called ADOPT(k), that generalizes them. Its behavior depends on the k parameter. It behaves like ADOPT when k = 1, like BnB-ADOPT when k = \u221e and like a hybrid of ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT when 1 < k < \u221e. We prove that ADOPT(k) is a correct and complete algorithm and experimentally show that ADOPT(k) outperforms ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT on several benchmarks across several metrics.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Patricia Gutierrez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gutierrez:Patricia", "Pedro Meseguer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meseguer:Pedro", "William Yeoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeoh_0001:William"], "pages": 6}
