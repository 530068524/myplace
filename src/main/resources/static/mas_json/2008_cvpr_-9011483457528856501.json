{"title": "3D pose refinement from reflections.", "fields": ["real image", "exploit", "pose", "polygon mesh", "image based lighting"], "abstract": "We demonstrate how to exploit reflections for accurate registration of shiny objects: The lighting environment can be retrieved from the reflections under a distant illumination assumption. Since it remains unchanged when the camera or the object of interest moves, this provides powerful additional constraints that can be incorporated into standard pose estimation algorithms. The key idea and main contribution of the paper is therefore to show that the registration should also be performed in the lighting environment space, instead of in the image space only. This lets us recover very accurate pose estimates because the specularities are very sensitive to pose changes. An interesting side result is an accurate estimate of the lighting environment. Furthermore, since the mapping from lighting environment to specularities has no analytical expression for objects represented as 3D meshes, and is not 1-to-1, registering lighting environments is far from trivial. However we propose a general and effective solution. Our approach is demonstrated on both synthetic and real images.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Pascal Lagger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lagger:Pascal", "Mathieu Salzmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salzmann:Mathieu", "Vincent Lepetit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepetit:Vincent", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal"], "pages": -1}
