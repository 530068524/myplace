Inspired by recently proposed HC-search framework, we decompose the incremental parsing algorithm into two steps: first searching a set of high-quality outputs with beam-search, and second selecting the best output with a ranking model. We learn our incremental parsing model with a relaxed learning objective. We incorporate arbitrary features in our ranking model and learn the model from fine grain ranking examples. Experimental results on standard English and Chinese datasets show our method significantly outperforms a strong baseline.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yijia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yijia", "Wanxiang Che.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Che:Wanxiang", "Bing Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin_0001:Bing", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ting"], "pages": 7}
