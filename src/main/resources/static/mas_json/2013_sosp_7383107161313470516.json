Applications may be locked into a choice that is not ideal for all clients and changing conditions. Pileus is a replicated key-value store that allows applications to declare their consistency and latency priorities via consistency-based service level agreements (SLAs). It dynamically selects which servers to access in order to deliver the best service given the current configuration and system conditions. In application-specific SLAs, developers can request both strong and eventual consistency as well as intermediate guarantees such as read-my-writes. Evaluations running on a worldwide test bed with geo-replicated data show that the system adapts to varying client-server latencies to provide service that matches or exceeds the best static consistency choice and server selection scheme.", "citation": "Citations (184)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Douglas B.
