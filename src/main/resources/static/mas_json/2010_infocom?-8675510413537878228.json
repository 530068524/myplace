{"title": "Distributed Resource Allocation for Synchronous Fork and Join Processing Networks.", "fields": ["fork", "streams", "scalability", "data stream mining", "server"], "abstract": "Many emerging information processing applications require applying various fork and join type operations such as correlation, aggregation, and encoding/decoding to data streams in real-time. Each operation will require one or more simultaneous input data streams and produce one or more output streams, where the processing may shrink or expand the data rates upon completion. Multiple tasks can be co-located on the same server and compete for limited resources. Effective in-network processing and resource management in a distributed heterogeneous environment is critical to achieving better scalability and provision of quality of service. In this paper, we study the distributed resource allocation problem for a synchronous fork and join processing network, with the goal of achieving the maximum total utility of output streams. Using primal and dual based optimization techniques, we propose several decentralized iterative algorithms to solve the problem, and design protocols that implement these algorithms. These algorithms have different strengths in practical implementation and can be tailored to take full advantage of the computing capabilities of individual servers. We show that our algorithms guarantee optimality and demonstrate through simulation that they can adapt quickly to dynamically changing environments.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Ohio State University", "Nokia", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Haiquan (Chuck) Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Haiquan_=Chuck=", "Cathy H.
