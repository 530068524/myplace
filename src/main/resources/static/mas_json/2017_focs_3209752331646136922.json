The extent to which a time hierarchy-type theorem holds in the classic distributed LOCAL model has been open for many years. In particular, it is consistent with previous results that all natural problems in the LOCAL model can be classified according to a small constant number of complexities, such as O(1), O(log* n), O(log n), 2^{O(sqrt{log n}), etc.In this paper we establish the first time hierarchy theorem for the LOCAL model and prove that several gaps exist in the LOCAL time hierarchy. Our main results are as follows:\u2022 We define an infinite set of simple coloring problems called Hierarchical 2\u00bd-Coloring. A correctly colored graph can be confirmed by simply checking the neighborhood of each vertex, so this problem fits into the class of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems. However, the complexity of the k-level Hierarchical 2\u00bd-Coloring problem is \u0398(n^{1/k}), for positive integer k. The upper and lower bounds hold for both general graphs and trees, and for both randomized and deterministic algorithms.\u2022 Consider any LCL problem on bounded degree trees. We prove an automatic-speedup theorem that states that any randomized n^{o(1)}-time algorithm solving the LCL can be transformed into a deterministic O(log n)-time algorithm. Together with a previous result, this establishes that on trees, there are no natural deterministic complexities in the ranges \u03c9(log* n)\u2014o(log n) or \u03c9(log n)\u2014n^{o(1)}.\u2022 We expose a gap in the randomized time hierarchy on general graphs. Roughly speaking, any randomized algorithm that solves an LCL problem in sublogarithmic time can be sped up to run in O(T_{LLL}) time, which is the complexity of the distributed Lovasz local lemma problem, currently known to be \u03a9(log log n) and 2^{O(sqrt{log log n})} on bounded degree graphs.Finally, we revisit Naor and Stockmeyers characterization of O(1)-time LOCAL algorithms for LCL problems (as order-invariant w.r.t. vertex IDs) and calculate the complexity gaps that are directly implied by their proof. For n-rings we see a \u03c9(1)\u2014o(log* n) complexity gap, for (sqrt{n} \u00d7 \u221a{n})-tori an \u03c9(1)\u2014o(sqrt{log* n}) gap, and for bounded degree trees and general graphs, an \u03c9(1)\u2014o(log(log* n)) complexity gap.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Electrical Engi ... and Engineering"], "authors": ["Yi-Jun Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi=Jun", "Seth Pettie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pettie:Seth"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
