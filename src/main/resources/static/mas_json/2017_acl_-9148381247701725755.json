{"title": "Affect-LM: A Neural Language Model for Customizable Affective Text Generation.", "fields": ["perplexity", "affect", "correctness", "nonverbal communication", "language model"], "abstract": "Human verbal communication includes affective messages which are conveyed through use of emotionally colored words. There has been a lot of research in this direction but the problem of integrating state-of-the-art neural language models with affective information remains an area ripe for exploration. In this paper, we propose an extension to an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) language model for generating conversational text, conditioned on affect categories. Our proposed model, Affect-LM enables us to customize the degree of emotional content in generated sentences through an additional design parameter. Perception studies conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk show that Affect-LM generates naturally looking emotional sentences without sacrificing grammatical correctness. Affect-LM also learns affect-discriminative word representations, and perplexity experiments show that additional affective information in conversational text can improve language model prediction.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sayan Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Sayan", "Mathieu Chollet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chollet:Mathieu", "Eugene Laksana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laksana:Eugene", "Louis-Philippe Morency.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morency:Louis=Philippe", "Stefan Scherer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scherer:Stefan"], "pages": 9}
