{"title": "Inverting RANSAC: Global model detection via inlier rate estimation.", "fields": ["ransac", "estimator", "pattern recognition", "generative model", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This work presents a novel approach for detecting inliers in a given set of correspondences (matches). It does so without explicitly identifying any consensus set, based on a method for inlier rate estimation (IRE). Given such an estimator for the inlier rate, we also present an algorithm that detects a globally optimal transformation. We provide a theoretical analysis of the IRE method using a stochastic generative model on the continuous spaces of matches and transformations. This model allows rigorous investigation of the limits of our IRE method for the case of 2D-translation, further giving bounds and insights for the more general case. Our theoretical analysis is validated empirically and is shown to hold in practice for the more general case of 2D-affinities. In addition, we show that the combined framework works on challenging cases of 2D-homography estimation, with very few and possibly noisy inliers, where RANSAC generally fails.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Roee Litman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Litman:Roee", "Simon Korman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korman:Simon", "Alexander M.
