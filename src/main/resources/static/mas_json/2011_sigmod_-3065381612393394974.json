We consider its simplest form, conjunctive queries and views, which already is NP-complete. Our context is data integration, so we search for maximally-contained rewritings. By looking at the problem from a graph perspective we are able to gain a better insight and develop an algorithm which compactly represents common patterns in the source descriptions, and (optionally) pushes some computation offline. This together with other optimizations result in an experimental performance about two orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art algorithms, rewriting queries using over 10000 views within seconds.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["George Konstantinidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konstantinidis:George", "Jos\u00e9 Luis Ambite.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ambite:Jos=eacute=_Luis"], "pages": 12}
