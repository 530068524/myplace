{"title": "A Quasipolynomial Reduction for Generalized Selective Decryption on Trees.", "fields": ["symmetric key algorithm", "multicast encryption", "adversary", "hierarchy", "exponential function"], "abstract": "Generalized Selective Decryption (GSD), introduced by Panjwani [TCC\u201907], is a game for a symmetric encryption scheme \\(\\mathsf{Enc}\\) that captures the difficulty of proving adaptive security of certain protocols, most notably the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) multicast encryption protocol. In the GSD game there are n keys \\(k_1,\\ldots ,k_n\\), which the adversary may adaptively corrupt (learn); moreover, it can ask for encryptions \\(\\mathsf{Enc}_{k_i}(k_j)\\) of keys under other keys. The adversary\u2019s task is to distinguish keys (which it cannot trivially compute) from random. Proving the hardness of GSD assuming only IND-CPA security of \\(\\mathsf{Enc}\\) is surprisingly hard. Using \u201ccomplexity leveraging\u201d loses a factor exponential in n, which makes the proof practically meaningless.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Northeastern University", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "authors": ["Georg Fuchsbauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuchsbauer:Georg", "Zahra Jafargholi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jafargholi:Zahra", "Krzysztof Pietrzak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietrzak:Krzysztof"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
