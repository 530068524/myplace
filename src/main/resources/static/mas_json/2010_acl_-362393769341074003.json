{"title": "Cross-Language Text Classification Using Structural Correspondence Learning.", "fields": ["oracle", "german", "domain adaptation", "robustness", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We present a new approach to cross-language text classification that builds on structural correspondence learning, a recently proposed theory for domain adaptation. The approach uses unlabeled documents, along with a simple word translation oracle, in order to induce task-specific, cross-lingual word correspondences. We report on analyses that reveal quantitative insights about the use of unlabeled data and the complexity of inter-language correspondence modeling.\n\nWe conduct experiments in the field of cross-language sentiment classification, employing English as source language, and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The results are convincing; they demonstrate both the robustness and the competitiveness of the presented ideas.", "citation": "Citations (156)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Bauhaus University, Weimar", "Bauhaus University, Weimar"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Peter Prettenhofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prettenhofer:Peter", "Benno Stein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stein:Benno"], "pages": 10}
