Various capabilities, such as DDoS detection and load balancing, require insights about multiple metrics including Bloom filters, per-flow counting, count distinct and entropy estimation. \nIn this work, we present a unified construction that solves all the above problems in the sliding window model. Our single solution offers a better space to accuracy tradeoff than the state-of-the-art for each of these individual problems! We show this both analytically and by running multiple real Internet backbone and datacenter packet traces.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Bell Labs", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Eran Assaf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Assaf:Eran", "Ran Ben-Basat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Basat:Ran", "Gil Einziger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Einziger:Gil", "Roy Friedman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedman:Roy"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
