Our approach is to construct estimators for particular integral functionals of two densities and translate them into divergence estimators. For the integral functionals, our estimators are based on corrections of a preliminary plug-in estimator. We show that these estimators achieve the parametric convergence rate of n-1/2 when the densities' smoothness, s, are both at least d/4 where d is the dimension. We also derive minimax lower bounds for this problem which confirm that s > d/4 is necessary to achieve the n-1/2 rate of convergence. We validate our theoretical guarantees with a number of simulations.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Akshay Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Akshay", "Kirthevasan Kandasamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kandasamy:Kirthevasan", "Barnab\u00e1s P\u00f3czos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=oacute=czos:Barnab=aacute=s", "Larry A.
