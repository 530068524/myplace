In this paper, we propose Relational Norm Intervention (RNI) model for behavior change, which involves two individuals as a target user and a helper respectively. RNI model uses Negative Reinforcement and Other-Regarding Preferences as motivating factors for behavior change. The model features the passive participation of a helper who will undergo artificially generated discomforts (e.g., limited access to a mobile device) when a target user performs against a target behavior. Based on in-depth discussions from a two-phase design workshop, we designed and implemented BeUpright, a mobile application employing RNI model to correct sitting posture of a target user. Also, we conducted a two-week study to evaluate the effectiveness and user experience of BeUpright. The study showed that the RNI model has a potential to increase efficacy, in terms of behavior change, compared to conventional notification approaches. The most influential factor of RNI model in the changing the behavior of target users was the intention to avoid discomforting their helpers. RNI model also showed a potential to help unmotivated individuals in behavior change. We discuss the mechanism of the RNI model in relation to prior literature on behavior change and implications of exploiting discomfort in mobile behavior change services.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "Michigan State University", "University of California, San Diego", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jaemyung Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Jaemyung", "Bumsoo Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Bumsoo", "Taiwoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Taiwoo", "Jina Huh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huh:Jina", "Jinhan Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jinhan", "Junehwa Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junehwa"], "pages": 13}
