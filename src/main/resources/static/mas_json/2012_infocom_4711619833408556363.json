The inherent variability of the wireless channel as well as the Variable Bit Rate (VBR) of the compressed video streams make QoE management a challenging problem. Prior work has studied this problem in the context of transmitting a single video stream. In this paper, we investigate multiplexing schemes to transmit multiple video streams from a base station to mobile clients that use number of playout stalls as a performance metric. In this context, we present an epoch-by-epoch framework to fairly allocate wireless transmission slots to streaming videos. In each epoch our scheme essentially reduces the vulnerability to stalling by allocating slots to videos in a way that maximizes the minimum \u2018playout lead\u2019 across all videos. Next, we show that the problem of allocating slots fairly is NP-complete even for a constant number of videos. We then present a fast lead-aware greedy algorithm for the problem. Our choice of greedy algorithm is motivated by the fact that this algorithm is optimal when the channel quality of a user remains unchanged within an epoch (but different users may experience different channel quality). Moreover, our experimental results based on public MPEG-4 video traces and wireless channel traces that we collected from a WiMAX test-bed show that the lead-aware greedy approach performs a fair distribution of stalls across the clients when compared to other algorithms, while still maintaining similar or lower average number of stalls per client.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["IBM", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Xerox", "IBM", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "IBM"], "authors": ["Partha Dutta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dutta:Partha", "Anand Seetharam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seetharam:Anand", "Vijay Arya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arya:Vijay", "Malolan Chetlur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chetlur:Malolan", "Shivkumar Kalyanaraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalyanaraman:Shivkumar", "Jim Kurose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurose:Jim"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
