{"title": "Revealing real quality of double compressed MP3 audio.", "fields": ["audio signal processing", "audio forensics", "lossless compression", "digital audio", "transform coding"], "abstract": "MP3 is the most popular format for audio storage and a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback. The flexibility of compression ratio of MP3 coding enables users to choose their customized configuration in the trade-off between file size and quality. Double MP3 compression often occurs in audio forgery, steganography and quality faking by transcoding an MP3 audio to a different compression ratio. To detect double MP3 compression, in this paper, we extract the statistical features on the modified discrete cosine transform, and apply support vector machines and a dynamic evolving neuron-fuzzy inference system to the extracted features for classification. Experimental results show that our method effectively and accurately detects double MP3 compression for both up-transcoded and down-transcoded MP3 files. Our study also indicates the potential for mining the audio processing history for forensic purposes.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "departments": ["New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology", "New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology", "Sam Houston State University"], "authors": ["Mengyu Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao:Mengyu", "Andrew H.
