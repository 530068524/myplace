{"title": "Foldem: Heterogeneous Object Fabrication via Selective Ablation of Multi-Material Sheets.", "fields": ["software", "ablation", "laser ablation", "laser", "vector graphics"], "abstract": "Foldem, a novel method of rapid fabrication of objects with multi-material properties is presented. Our specially formulated Foldem sheet allows users to fabricate and easily assemble objects with rigid, bendable, and flexible properties using a standard laser-cutter. The user begins by creating his designs in a vector graphics software package. A laser cutter is then used to fabricate the design by selectively ablating/vaporizing one or more layers of the Foldem sheet to achieve the desired physical properties for each joint. Herein the composition of the Foldem sheet, as well as various design considerations taken into account while building and designing the method, are described. Sample objects made with Foldem are demonstrated, each showcasing the unique attributes of Foldem. Additionally, a novel method for carefully calibrating a laser cutter for precise ablation is presented.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Varun Perumal C.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/C:Varun_Perumal", "Daniel J.
