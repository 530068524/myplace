We present a more natural way of searching for relevant scientific literature. Rather than a string of keywords, we define a query as a small set of papers deemed relevant to the research task at hand. By optimizing an objective function based on a fine-grained notion of influence between documents, our approach efficiently selects a set of highly relevant articles. Moreover, as scientists trust some authors more than others, results are personalized to individual preferences. In a user study, researchers found the papers recommended by our method to be more useful, trustworthy and diverse than those selected by popular alternatives, such as Google Scholar and a state-of-the-art topic modeling approach.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Khalid El-Arini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/El=Arini:Khalid", "Carlos Guestrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guestrin:Carlos"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
