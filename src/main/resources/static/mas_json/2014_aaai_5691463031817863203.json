While players can gain a lot of traction by an efficient inference algorithm for GDL, state-of-the-art reasoners suffer from a variant of a classical KR problem, the inferential frame problem. We present a method by which general game players can transform any given game description into a representation that solves this problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that with the help of automatically generated domain knowledge, a significant speedup can thus be obtained for the majority of the game descriptions from the AAAI competition.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "Universit\u00e4t Potsdam"], "authors": ["Javier Romero Davila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davila:Javier_Romero", "Abdallah Saffidine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saffidine:Abdallah", "Michael Thielscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thielscher:Michael"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
