The system includes first and second image sources, a beamcombiner, a lens and a reflective element. The reflective elements reflects the image of the second image source to the beamcombiner. The first and second image sources, the beamcombiner, and the single lens present a foreground image and a background image, with the background image presented at a greater distance from the viewer than the foreground image. The viewer perceives the foreground image and the background image as part of a scene having depth.", "citation": "Citations (597)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Ericsson Mobile Communications", "Sarnoff Corporation", "Sarnoff Corporation", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Tel Aviv University", "DOLGOFF EUGENE"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Teresa Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko:Teresa", "Stefano Soatto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soatto:Stefano", "Deborah Estrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Estrin:Deborah"], "pages": 8}
