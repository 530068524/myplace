By reinterpreting correlation measures in ROC space and formulating correlated itemset mining as a constraint programming problem, we obtain new theoretical insights with practical benefits. More specifically, we contribute 1) an improved bound for correlated itemset miners, 2) a novel iterative pruning algorithm to exploit the bound, and 3) an adaptation of this algorithm to mine all itemsets on the convex hull in ROC space. The algorithm does not depend on a minimal frequency threshold and is shown to outperform several alternative approaches by orders of magnitude, both in runtime and in memory requirements.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Siegfried Nijssen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nijssen:Siegfried", "Tias Guns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guns:Tias", "Luc De Raedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raedt:Luc_De"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
