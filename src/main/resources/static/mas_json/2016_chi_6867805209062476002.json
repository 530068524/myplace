In this paper, we seek to understand both the opportunities and bottlenecks in the use of self-logged data for differential diagnosis and care planning during patient visits to both primary and secondary care. We first conducted a literature review to identify potential factors influencing the use of self-logged data in clinical settings. This informed the design of our experiment, in which we applied a vignette-based role-play approach with general practitioners and hospital specialists in the US and UK, to elicit reflections on and insights about using patient self-logged data. Our analysis reveals multiple opportunities for the use of self-logged data in the differential diagnosis workflow, identifying capture, representational, and interpretational challenges that are potentially preventing self-logged data from being effectively interpreted and applied by clinicians to derive a patient's prognosis and plan of care.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Peter West.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/West:Peter", "Richard Giordano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giordano:Richard", "Max Van Kleek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleek:Max_Van", "Nigel Shadbolt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shadbolt:Nigel"], "pages": 13}
