Data service providers need appropriate and flexible query charging mechanisms and query optimization that take into consideration cloud operational expenses, pricing strategies and user preferences. Yet, existing solutions are static and non-configurable. We demonstrate  COCCUS , a modular system for cost-aware query execution, adaptive query charge and optimization of cloud data services. The audience can set their queries along with their execution preferences and budget constraints, while  COCCUS  adaptively determines query charge and manages secondary data structures according to various economic policies. We demonstrate  COCCUS 's operation over centralized and shared nothing CloudDBMS architectures on top of public and private IaaS clouds. The audience is enabled to set economic policies and execute various workloads through a comprehensive GUI.  COCCUS 's adaptability is showcased using real-time graphs depicting a number of key performance metrics.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National Technical University of Athens", "University of Geneva", "Ionian University", "National Technical University of Athens"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ioannis Konstantinou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konstantinou:Ioannis", "Verena Kantere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kantere:Verena", "Dimitrios Tsoumakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsoumakos:Dimitrios", "Nectarios Koziris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koziris:Nectarios"], "pages": 4}
