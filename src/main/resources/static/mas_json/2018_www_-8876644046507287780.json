High reciprocity has been widely observed in many directed social media networks such as following relations in Twitter and Tumblr. Therefore, reciprocal relations between users are often regarded as a basic mechanism to create stable social ties and play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of networks. Each reciprocity relation is formed by two parasocial links in a back-and-forth manner with a time delay. Hence, understanding the delay can help us gain better insights into the underlying mechanisms of network dynamics. Meanwhile, the accurate prediction of delay has practical implications in advancing a variety of real-world applications such as friend recommendation and marketing campaign. For example, by knowing when will users follow back, service providers can focus on the users with a potential long reciprocal delay for effective targeted marketing. This paper presents the initial investigation of the time delay in reciprocal relations. Our study is based on a large-scale directed network from Tumblr that consists of 62.8 million users and 3.1 billion user following relations with a timespan of multiple years (from 31 Oct 2007 to 24 Jul 2013).  We reveal a number of interesting patterns about the delay that motivate the development of a principled learning model to predict the delay in reciprocal relations. Experimental results on the above mentioned dynamic networks corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed delay prediction model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Michigan State University", "Arizona State University", "Amazon.com", "Jilin University"], "authors": ["Jundong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jundong", "Jiliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jiliang", "Yilin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yilin", "Yali Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Yali", "Yi Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi", "Huan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Huan"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
