{"title": "deSEO: Combating Search-Result Poisoning.", "fields": ["world wide web", "malware", "internet privacy", "compromise", "computer security"], "abstract": "We perform an in-depth study of SEO attacks that spread malware by poisoning search results for popular queries. Such attacks, although recent, appear to be both widespread and effective. They compromise legitimate Web sites and generate a large number of fake pages targeting trendy keywords. We first dissect one example attack that affects over 5,000 Web domains and attracts over 81,000 user visits. Further, we develop de-SEO, a system that automatically detects these attacks. Using large datasets with hundreds of billions of URLs, deSEO successfully identifies multiple malicious SEO campaigns. In particular, applying the URL signatures derived from deSEO, we find 36% of sampled searches to Google and Bing contain at least one malicious link in the top results at the time of our experiment.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["John P.
