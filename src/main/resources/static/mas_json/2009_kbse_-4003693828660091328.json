{"title": "A Modelling Language for Interactive Web Applications.", "fields": ["rich internet application", "computer aided software engineering", "object oriented modeling", "unified modeling language", "web application"], "abstract": "Web applications are increasingly becoming the most important platform for software applications in industry, with many modelling languages proposed to handle the complexity of developing, documenting and deploying these applications. New technology has allowed for development of Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) which increase usability and reliability; however, existing modelling languages fall short of modelling many of these new concepts. The research in this Ph.D. seeks to identify these new modelling challenges, and develop an approach that is suitable for modelling RIAs.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Massey University"], "authors": ["Jevon M.
