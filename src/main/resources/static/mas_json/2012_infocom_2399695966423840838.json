Specifically, we investigate the case of N vehicles in a grid-like street layout while the number of road segments increases linearly with the population of vehicles. Each vehicle moves in a localized mobility region centered at a fixed social spot and communicates to a destination vehicle in the same mobility region via a unicast flow. With a variant of the two-hop relay scheme applied, we show that social-proximity urban networks are scalable: a constant average per-vehicle throughput can be achieved with high probability. Furthermore, although the throughput and delay of a unicast flow may degrade in a high density area, almost constant per-vehicle throughput \u2126(1 over log (N)) and almost constant delay O(log 2  (N)) (except for the polylogarithmic factor) are still achievable with high probability. By identifying the key impact factors of performance mathematically, our results should provide insight on the design and deployment of future vehicular networks.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "General Motors"], "authors": ["Ning Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0001:Ning", "Tom H.
