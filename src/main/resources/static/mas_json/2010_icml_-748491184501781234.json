The cutsize is induced by the unknown adversarial labeling of the graph nodes. In deriving our characterization, we obtain a simple randomized algorithm achieving the optimal mistake bound on any weighted graph. Our algorithm draws a random spanning tree of the original graph and then predicts the nodes of this tree in constant amortized time and linear space. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method compares well to both global (Perceptron) and local (label-propagation) methods, while being much faster.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Milan", "University of Milan", "University of Milan", "DICOM, Universi ... nsubria, Italy"], "authors": ["Nicol\u00f2 Cesa-Bianchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cesa=Bianchi:Nicol=ograve=", "Claudio Gentile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentile:Claudio", "Fabio Vitale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitale:Fabio", "Giovanni Zappella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zappella:Giovanni"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
