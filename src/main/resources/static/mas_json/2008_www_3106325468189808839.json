Our approach differs architecturally from recent proposals that deal with distributed XML filtering; they assume an XML broker architecture, whereas our solution is built on top of distributed hash tables. The essence of our work is a distributed implementation of YFilter, a state-of-the-art automata-based XML filtering system on top of Chord. We experimentally evaluate our approach and demonstrate that our algorithms can scale to millions of XPath queries under various filtering scenarios, and also exhibit very good load balancing properties.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["National and Kapodistrian University of Athens", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"], "authors": ["Iris Miliaraki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miliaraki:Iris", "Zoi Kaoudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaoudi:Zoi", "Manolis Koubarakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koubarakis:Manolis"], "conf": "www", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
