To alleviate this, in this paper we take an entirely new approach and formulate sampling as a sparse subset selection problem where we propose to pick a small set of candidate samples that best explains the unknown pixels. Moreover, we describe a new distance measure for comparing two samples which is based on KL-divergence between the distributions of features extracted in the vicinity of the samples. Using a standard benchmark dataset for image matting, we demonstrate that our approach provides more accurate results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Hacettepe University", "Hacettepe University", "Hacettepe University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Levent Karacan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karacan:Levent", "Aykut Erdem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erdem:Aykut", "Erkut Erdem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erdem:Erkut"], "pages": 9}
