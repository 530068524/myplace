{"title": "A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Group Sparse Regularization with Overlapping Groups.", "fields": ["data deduplication", "diffusing update algorithm", "dual space", "newton s method", "lasso"], "abstract": "We deal with the problem of variable selection when variables must be selected group-wise, with possibly overlapping groups defined a priori. In particular we propose a new optimization procedure for solving the regularized algorithm presented in [12], where the group lasso penalty is generalized to overlapping groups of variables. While in [12] the proposed implementation requires explicit replication of the variables belonging to more than one group, our iterative procedure is based on a combination of proximal methods in the primal space and projected Newton method in a reduced dual space, corresponding to the active groups. This procedure provides a scalable alternative with no need for data duplication, and allows to deal with high dimensional problems without pre-processing for dimensionality reduction. The computational advantages of our scheme with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms using data duplication are shown empirically with numerical simulations.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "DISI- Universit\u00e0 di Genova", "DISI- Universit\u00e0 di Genova", "DISI- Universit\u00e0 di Genova"], "authors": ["Sofia Mosci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mosci:Sofia", "Silvia Villa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villa:Silvia", "Alessandro Verri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verri:Alessandro", "Lorenzo Rosasco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosasco:Lorenzo"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
