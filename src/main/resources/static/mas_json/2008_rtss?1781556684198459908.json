Each object is checked against itsbehavioral interface; first, to guarantee its correct outputbehavior, and second to make sure that every messageit may receive is processed within the designateddeadline (schedulability analysis). Next, we propose anew technique for testing whether every object is usedas expected (i.e., according to its behavioral interface)when combined with other objects (compatibility check).Compatibility additionally implies schedulability in thecontext of the actual system. The analyses are automatedusing the Uppaal model checker.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["CWI, Amsterdam", "CWI, Amsterdam", "CWI, Amsterdam", "CWI, Amsterdam"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Mohammad Mahdi Jaghoori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaghoori:Mohammad_Mahdi", "Delphine Longuet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Longuet:Delphine", "Frank S. de Boer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boer:Frank_S=_de", "Tom Chothia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chothia:Tom"], "pages": 10}
