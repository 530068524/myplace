Two main approaches have been pursued: (1) static modeling \u2014 typically posed as a discriminative classification problem in which each video frame is evaluated independently; (2) temporal modeling \u2014 frames are segmented into sequences and typically modeled with a variant of dynamic Bayesian networks. We propose a segment-based approach, kSeg-SVM, that incorporates benefits of both approaches and avoids their limitations. kSeg-SVM is a temporal extension of the spatial bag-of-words. kSeg-SVM is trained within a structured output SVM framework that formulates AU detection as a problem of detecting temporal events in a time series of visual features. Each segment is modeled by a variant of the BoW representation with soft assignment of the words based on similarity. Our framework has several benefits for AU detection: (1) both dependencies between features and the length of action units are modeled; (2) all possible segments of the video may be used for training; and (3) no assumptions are required about the underlying structure of the action unit events (e.g., i.i.d.). Our algorithm finds the best k-or-fewer segments that maximize the SVM score. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art static methods for AU detection.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tomas Simon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simon:Tomas", "Minh Hoai Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Minh_Hoai", "Fernando De la Torre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torre:Fernando_De_la", "Jeffrey F.
