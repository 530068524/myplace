Textual annotations are used not only to describe the visual content of an image, but also subjective, spatial, temporal and social dimensions, complicating the task of keyword-based search. In this paper we investigate a method that exploits visual annotations, e.g. notes in Flickr, to enhance keyword-based systems retrieval performance. For this purpose we adopt the bag-of-visual-words approach for content-based image retrieval as our baseline. We then apply rank aggregation of the top 25 results obtained with a set of visual annotations that match the keyword-based query. The results on retrieval experiments show significant improvements in retrieval performance when comparing the aggregated approach with our baseline, which also slightly outperforms text-only search. When using a textual filter on the search space in combination with the aggregated approach an additional boost in retrieval performance is observed, which underlines the need for large scale content-based image retrieval techniques to complement the text-based search.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Pompeu Fabra University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Ximena Olivares.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivares:Ximena", "Massimiliano Ciaramita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciaramita:Massimiliano", "Roelof van Zwol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwol:Roelof_van"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
