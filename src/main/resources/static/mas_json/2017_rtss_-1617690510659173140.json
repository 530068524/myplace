The notion of sustainability is extended to mixed-criticality systems, and sustainability properties are determined for a variety of widely-studied uniprocessor and multi-processor mixed-criticality scheduling algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Missouri University of Science and Technology", "Missouri University of Science and Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Zhishan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Zhishan", "Sai Sruti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sruti:Sai", "Bryan C.
