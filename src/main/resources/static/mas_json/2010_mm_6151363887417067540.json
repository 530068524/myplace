{"title": "Combining multi-probe histogram and order-statistics based LSH for scalable audio content retrieval.", "fields": ["locality sensitive hashing", "machine learning", "histogram", "scalability", "order statistic"], "abstract": "In order to improve the reliability and the scalability of content-based retrieval of variant audio tracks from large music databases, we suggest a new multi-stage LSH scheme that consists in (i) extracting compact but accurate representations from audio tracks by exploiting the LSH idea to summarize audio tracks, and (ii) adequately organizing the resulting representations in LSH tables, retaining almost the same accuracy as an exact kNN retrieval. In the first stage, we use major bins of successive chroma features to calculate a multi-probe histogram (MPH) that is concise but retains the information about local temporal correlations. In the second stage, based on the order statistics (OS) of the MPH, we propose a new LSH scheme, OS-LSH, to organize and probe the histograms. The representation and organization of the audio tracks are storage efficient and support robust and scalable retrieval. Extensive experiments over a large dataset with 30,000 real audio tracks confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["New Jersey Institute of Technology", "Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "University of Milan"], "authors": ["Yi Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Yi", "Michel Crucianu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crucianu:Michel", "Vincent Oria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oria:Vincent", "Ernesto Damiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damiani:Ernesto"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
