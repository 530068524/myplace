{"title": "Precise indoor localization using smart phones.", "fields": ["embedded system", "computer science", "accelerometer"], "abstract": "We present an indoor localization application leveraging the sensing capabilities of current state of the art smart phones. To the best of our knowledge, our application is the first one to be implemented in smart phones and integrating both offline and online phases of fingerprinting, delivering an accuracy of up to 1.5 meters. In particular, we have studied the possibilities offered by WiFi radio, cellular communications radio, accelerometer and magnetometer, already embedded in smart phones, with the intention to build a multimodal solution for localization. We have also implemented a new approach for the statistical processing of radio signal strengths, showing that it can outperform existing deterministic techniques.", "citation": "Citations (231)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "International Computer Science Institute", "International Computer Science Institute", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Eladio Martin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martin:Eladio", "Oriol Vinyals.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vinyals:Oriol", "Gerald Friedland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedland:Gerald", "Ruzena Bajcsy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bajcsy:Ruzena"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
