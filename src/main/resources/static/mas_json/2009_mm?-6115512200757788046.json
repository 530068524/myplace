The video begins by describing the holistic approach to embodied and mediated learning developed by our transdisciplinary research team, grounded in understandings derived from research in the learning sciences, digital media and human computer interaction. We then outline the three core tenets of effective learning exemplified by our research -- embodiment, multimodality and collaboration. The video next demonstrates the design and functionality of the physical and digital components of SMALLab. We conclude by illustrating our partner collaborations with K12 teachers and students with four scenarios depicting Geography, Physics, Language Arts and Chemistry learning modules.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Aisling Kelliher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelliher:Aisling", "David Birchfield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Birchfield:David", "Ellen Campana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Campana:Ellen", "Sarah Hatton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hatton:Sarah", "Mina Johnson-Glenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson=Glenberg:Mina", "Christopher Martinez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martinez:Christopher", "Loren Olson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olson:Loren", "Philippos Savvides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savvides:Philippos", "Lisa M.
