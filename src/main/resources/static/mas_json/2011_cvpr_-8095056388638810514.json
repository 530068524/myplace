Although its importance, evaluations of recent background subtraction methods with respect to the challenges of video surveillance suffer from various shortcomings. To address this issue, we first identify the main challenges of background subtraction in the field of video surveillance. We then compare the performance of nine background subtraction methods with post-processing according to their ability to meet those challenges. Therefore, we introduce a new evaluation data set with accurate ground truth annotations and shadow masks. This enables us to provide precise in-depth evaluation of the strengths and drawbacks of background subtraction methods.", "citation": "Citations (585)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sebastian Brutzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brutzer:Sebastian", "Benjamin H\u00f6ferlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=ferlin:Benjamin", "Gunther Heidemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heidemann:Gunther"], "pages": 8}
