{"title": "An Exact Inference Scheme for MinSAT.", "fields": ["multiset", "correctness", "inference", "maximum satisfiability problem", "rule of inference"], "abstract": "We describe an exact inference-based algorithm for the MinSAT problem. Given a multiset of clauses \u03b8, the algorithm derives as many empty clauses as the maximum number of clauses that can be falsified in \u03b8 by applying finitely many times an inference rule, and returns an optimal assignment. We prove the correctness of the algorithm, describe how it can be extended to deal with weighted Min-SAT and weighted partial MinSAT instances, analyze the differences between the MaxSAT and MinSAT inference schemes, and define and empirically evaluate the MinSAT Pure Literal Rule.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Spanish National Research Council"], "authors": ["Chu Min Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chu_Min", "Felip Many\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Many=agrave=:Felip"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
