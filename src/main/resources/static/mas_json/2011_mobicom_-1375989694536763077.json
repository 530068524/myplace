In this paper, we propose a novel spectrum sharing protocol called Collision-Resistant Multiple Access (CRMA) to achieve high efficiency. In CRMA, each transmitter views the OFDM physical layer as multiple orthogonal but sharable channels, and independently selects a few channels for transmission. The transmissions that share the same channel naturally add up in the air. The receiver extracts the received signals from all the channels and efficiently decodes the transmissions by solving a simple linear system. We implement our approach in the Qualnet simulator and show that it yields significant improvement over existing spectrum sharing schemes. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using implementation and experiments on GNU Radios.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Tianji Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Tianji", "Mi Kyung Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Mi_Kyung", "Apurv Bhartia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhartia:Apurv", "Lili Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Lili", "Eric Rozner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rozner:Eric", "Yin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Yin", "Brad W.
