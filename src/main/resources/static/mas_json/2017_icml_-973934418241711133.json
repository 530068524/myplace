{"title": "A Richer Theory of Convex Constrained Optimization with Reduced Projections and Improved Rates.", "fields": ["proximal gradient methods", "linear matrix inequality", "compressed sensing", "convexity", "constrained optimization"], "abstract": "This paper focuses on convex constrained optimization problems, where the solution is subject to a convex inequality constraint. In particular, we aim at challenging problems for which both projection into the constrained domain and a linear optimization under the inequality constraint are time-consuming, which render both projected gradient methods and conditional gradient methods (a.k.a. the Frank-Wolfe algorithm) expensive. In this paper, we develop projection reduced optimization algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth optimization with improved convergence rates. We first present a general theory of optimization with only one projection. Its application to smooth optimization with only one projection yields $O(1/\\epsilon)$ iteration complexity, which can be further reduced under strong convexity and improves over the $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity established before for non-smooth optimization. Then we introduce the local error bound condition and develop faster convergent algorithms for non-strongly convex optimization at the price of a logarithmic number of projections. In particular, we achieve a convergence rate of $\\widetilde O(1/\\epsilon^{2(1-\\theta)})$ for non-smooth optimization and $\\widetilde O(1/\\epsilon^{1-\\theta})$ for smooth optimization, where $\\theta\\in(0,1]$ is a constant in the local error bound condition. An experiment on solving the constrained $\\ell_1$ minimization problem in compressive sensing demonstrates that the proposed algorithm achieve significant speed-up.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Iowa", "University of Iowa", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Tianbao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Tianbao", "Qihang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Qihang", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Lijun"], "pages": 10}
