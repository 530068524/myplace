{"title": "From Unlabelled Tweets to Twitter-specific Opinion Words.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "lexicon", "pattern recognition", "classifier", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "In this article, we propose a word-level classification model for automatically generating a Twitter-specific opinion lexicon from a corpus of unlabelled tweets. The tweets from the corpus are represented by two vectors: a bag-of-words vector and a semantic vector based on word-clusters. We propose a distributional representation for words by treating them as the centroids of the tweet vectors in which they appear. The lexicon generation is conducted by training a word-level classifier using these centroids to form the instance space and a seed lexicon to label the training instances. Experimental results show that the two types of tweet vectors complement each other in a statistically significant manner and that our generated lexicon produces significant improvements for tweet-level polarity classification.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Waikato", "University of Waikato", "University of Waikato"], "authors": ["Felipe Bravo-Marquez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bravo=Marquez:Felipe", "Eibe Frank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frank:Eibe", "Bernhard Pfahringer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfahringer:Bernhard"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
