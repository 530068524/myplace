{"title": "An Efficient Abortable-locking Protocol for Multi-level NUMA Systems.", "fields": ["lock", "lock convoy", "overhead", "thread", "timeout"], "abstract": "The popularity of Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architectures has led to numerous locality-preserving hierarchical lock designs, such as HCLH, HMCS, and cohort locks. Locality-preserving locks trade fairness for higher throughput. Hence, some instances of acquisitions can incur long latencies, which may be intolerable for certain applications. Few locks admit a waiting thread to abandon its protocol on a timeout. State-of-the-art abortable locks are not fully locality aware, introduce high overheads, and unsuitable for frequent aborts. Enhancing locality-aware locks with lightweight timeout capability is critical for their adoption. In this paper, we design and evaluate the HMCS-T lock, a Hierarchical MCS (HMCS) lock variant that admits a timeout. HMCS-T maintains the locality benefits of HMCS while ensuring aborts to be lightweight. HMCS-T offers the progress guarantee missing in most abortable queuing locks. Our evaluations show that HMCS-T offers the timeout feature at a moderate overhead over its HMCS analog. HMCS-T, used in an MPI runtime lock, mitigated the poor scalability of an MPI+OpenMP BFS code and resulted in 4.3x superior scaling.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Argonne National Laboratory", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Milind Chabbi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chabbi:Milind", "Abdelhalim Amer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amer:Abdelhalim", "Shasha Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Shasha", "Xu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Xu"], "pages": 14}
