{"title": "Automatic Creation of Massive Virtual Cities.", "fields": ["data modeling", "boundary representation", "systems modeling", "solid modeling", "ranging"], "abstract": "This research effort focuses on the historically-difficult problem of creating large-scale (city size) scene models from sensor data, including rapid extraction and modeling of geometry models. The solution to this problem is sought in the development of a novel modeling system with a fully automatic technique for the extraction of polygonal 3D models from LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data. The result is an accurate 3D model representation of the real-world as shown in Figure 1. We present and evaluate experimental results of our approach for the automatic reconstruction of large U. S. cities.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Charalambos Poullis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poullis:Charalambos", "Suya You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Suya"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
