{"title": "Cohesion: a hybrid memory model for accelerators.", "fields": ["bus sniffing", "memory coherence", "cache coherence", "address space", "mesi protocol"], "abstract": "Two broad classes of memory models are available today: models with hardware cache coherence, used in conventional chip multiprocessors, and models that rely upon software to manage coherence, found in compute accelerators. In some systems, both types of models are supported using disjoint address spaces and/or physical memories. In this paper we present Cohesion, a hybrid memory model that enables fine-grained temporal reassignment of data between hardware-managed and software-managed coherence domains, allowing a system to support both. Cohesion can be used to dynamically adapt to the sharing needs of both applications and runtimes. Cohesion requires neither copy operations nor multiple address spaces.   Cohesion offers the benefits of reduced message traffic and on-die directory overhead when software-managed coherence can be used and the advantages of hardware coherence for cases in which software-managed coherence is impractical. We demonstrate our protocol using a hierarchical, cached 1024-core processor with a single address space that supports both software-enforced coherence and a directory-based hardware coherence protocol. Relative to an optimistic, hardware-coherent baseline, a realizable Cohesion design achieves competitive performance with a 2\u00d7 reduction in message traffic, 2.1\u00d7 reduction in directory utilization, and greater robustness to on-die directory capacity.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["John H.
