A challenge in link prediction is the data sparsity problem. In this paper, we address this problem by jointly considering multiple heterogeneous link prediction tasks such as predicting links between users and different types of items including books, movies and songs, which we refer to as the collective link prediction (CLP) problem. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian framework for solving the CLP problem, which allows knowledge to be adaptively transferred across heterogeneous tasks while taking into account the similarities between tasks. We learn the inter-task similarity automatically. We also introduce link functions for different tasks to correct their biases and skewness of distributions in their link data. We conduct experiments on several real world datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over several existing state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Bin Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao_0001:Bin", "Nathan Nan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Nathan_Nan", "Qiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Qiang"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
