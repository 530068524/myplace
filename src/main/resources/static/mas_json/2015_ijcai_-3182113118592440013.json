Existing techniques based on the sample average approximation scheme and standard integer programming methods have high complexity and limited scalability. We propose a fast combinatorial optimization algorithm using Lagrangian relaxation and primal-dual techniques to solve the problem approximately. The algorithm provides a new way to address a range of conservation planning and scheduling problems. On the Red-cockaded Woodpecker data, our algorithm produces near optimal solutions and runs significantly faster than a standard mixed integer program solver. Compared with a greedy baseline, the solution quality is comparable or better, but our algorithm is 10-30 times faster. On synthetic problems that do not exhibit submodularity, our algorithm significantly outperforms the greedy baseline.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["XiaoJian Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:XiaoJian", "Daniel Sheldon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheldon:Daniel", "Shlomo Zilberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zilberstein:Shlomo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
