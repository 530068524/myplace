{"title": "BodyVis: A New Approach to Body Learning Through Wearable Sensing and Visualization.", "fields": ["biometrics", "wearable computer", "participatory design", "ranging", "iterative design"], "abstract": "Internal organs are hidden and untouchable, making it difficult for children to learn their size, position, and function. Traditionally, human anatomy (body form) and physiology (body function) are taught using techniques ranging from worksheets to three-dimensional models. We present a new approach called BodyVis, an e-textile shirt that combines biometric sensing and wearable visualizations to reveal otherwise invisible body parts and functions. We describe our 15-month iterative design process including lessons learned through the development of three prototypes using participatory design and two evaluations of the final prototype: a design probe interview with seven elementary school teachers and three single-session deployments in after-school programs. Our findings have implications for the growing area of wearables and tangibles for learning.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Leyla Norooz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norooz:Leyla", "Matthew Louis Mauriello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mauriello:Matthew_Louis", "Anita Jorgensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jorgensen:Anita", "Brenna McNally.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McNally:Brenna", "Jon E.
