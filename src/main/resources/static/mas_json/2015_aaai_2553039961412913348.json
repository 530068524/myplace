{"title": "Partial Meet Revision and Contraction in Logic Programs.", "fields": ["logic programming", "non monotonic logic", "description logic", "classical logic", "rationality"], "abstract": "The recent years have seen several proposals aimed at placing the revision of logic programs within the belief change frameworks established for classical logic. A crucial challenge of this task lies in the nonmono-tonicity of standard logic programming semantics. Existing approaches have thus used the monotonic characterisation via SE-models to develop semantic revision operators, which however neglect any syntactic information, or reverted to a syntax-oriented belief base approach altogether. In this paper, we bridge the gap between semantic and syntactic techniques by adapting the idea of a partial meet construction from classical belief change. This type of construction allows us to define new model-based operators for revising as well as contracting logic programs that preserve the syntactic structure of the programs involved. We demonstrate the rationality of our operators by testing them against the classic AGM or alternative belief change postulates adapted to the logic programming setting. We further present an algorithm that reduces the partial meet revision or contraction of a logic program to performing revision or contraction only on the relevant subsets of that program.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Griffith University", "Griffith University", "Griffith University"], "authors": ["Sebastian Binnewies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binnewies:Sebastian", "Zhiqiang Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Zhiqiang", "Kewen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kewen"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
