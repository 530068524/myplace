We reduce the computation of a quantitative loop invariant to solving constraints over program variables and unknown coefficients. Lagrange interpolation allows us to find constraints with less unknown coefficients. Counterexample-guided refinement furthermore generates linear constraints that pinpoint the desired quantitative invariants. We evaluate our technique by several case studies with polynomial quantitative loop invariants in the experiments.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica", "Institute of Software, CAS"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Yu-Fang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu=Fang", "Chih-Duo Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Chih=Duo", "Bow-Yaw Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Bow=Yaw", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lijun"], "pages": 17}
