{"title": "CIVL: Formal Verification of Parallel Programs.", "fields": ["formal verification", "posix threads", "software verification", "concurrency", "cuda"], "abstract": "CIVL is a framework for static analysis and verification of concurrent programs. One of the main challenges to practical application of these techniques is the large number of ways to express concurrency: MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, and Pthreads, for example, are just a few of many \"concurrency dialects\" in wide use today. These dialects are constantly evolving and it is increasingly common to use several of them in a single \"hybrid\" program. CIVL addresses these problems by providing a concurrency intermediate verification language, CIVL-C, as well as translators that consume C programs using these dialects and produce CIVL-C. Analysis and verification tools which operate on CIVL-C can then be applied easily to a wide variety of concurrent C programs. We demonstrate CIVL's error detection and verification capabilities on (1) an MPI+OpenMP program that estimates \u03c0 and contains a subtle race condition, and (2) an MPI-based 1d-wave simulator that fails to conform to a simple sequential implementation.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Delaware", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Delaware", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Delaware"], "authors": ["Manchun Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Manchun", "Michael S.
