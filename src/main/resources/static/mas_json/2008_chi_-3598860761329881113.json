{"title": "Lean and zoom: proximity-aware user interface and content magnification.", "fields": ["magnification", "user interface design", "user modeling", "zoom", "user interface"], "abstract": "The size and resolution of computer displays has increased dramatically, allowing more information than ever to be rendered on-screen. However, items can now be so small or screens so cluttered that users need to lean forward to properly examine them. This behavior may be detrimental to a user's posture and eyesight. Our Lean and Zoom system detects a user's proximity to the display using a camera and magnifies the on-screen content proportionally. This alleviates dramatic leaning and makes items more readable. Results from a user study indicate people find the technique natural and intuitive. Most participants found on-screen content easier to read, and believed the technique would improve both their performance and comfort.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chris Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Chris", "Anind K.
