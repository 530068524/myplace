However, copy-on-write increases the demand on the file system to find free blocks quickly; failure to do so may impede allocations for incoming writes. Efficiency is also important, because the task may consume CPU and other resources. In this paper, we describe the evolution (over more than a decade) of WAFL's algorithms and data structures for reclaiming space with minimal impact on the overall storage appliance performance.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Netapp", "Netapp", "Netapp"], "authors": ["Ram Kesavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kesavan:Ram", "Rohit Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Rohit", "Travis Grusecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grusecki:Travis", "Yuvraj Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Yuvraj"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
