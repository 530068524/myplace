As to better serve users' activities across different domains, many online social networks now support a new feature of \"Friends Circles\", which refines the domain-oblivious \"Friends\" concept. RS should also benefit from domain-specific \"Trust Circles\". Intuitively, a user may trust different subsets of friends regarding different domains. Unfortunately, in most existing multi-category rating datasets, a user's social connections from all categories are mixed together. This paper presents an effort to develop circle-based RS. We focus on inferring category-specific social trust circles from available rating data combined with social network data. We outline several variants of weighting friends within circles based on their inferred expertise levels. Through experiments on publicly available data, we demonstrate that the proposed circle-based recommendation models can better utilize user's social trust information, resulting in increased recommendation accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (298)", "departments": ["New York University", "Bell Labs", "New York University"], "authors": ["Xiwang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiwang", "Harald Steck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steck:Harald", "Yong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yong"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
