To encode such a function, we opt for a CNN-based model that is trained to account for a wide variety of changes in image appearance. To that end, we explore and study multiple neural network architectures, which are specifically adapted to this task. We show that such an approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several problems and benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (452)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole des ponts ParisTech", "\u00c9cole des ponts ParisTech"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sergey Zagoruyko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zagoruyko:Sergey", "Nikos Komodakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komodakis:Nikos"], "pages": 9}
