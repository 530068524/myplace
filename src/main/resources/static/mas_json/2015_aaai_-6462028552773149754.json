Our analysis of image tweets shows that while visual elements certainly play a large role in image-text relationships, other factors such as emotional elements, also factor into the relationship. We develop Visual-Emotional LDA (VELDA), a novel topic model to capture the image-text correlation from multiple perspectives (namely, visual and emotional).\n\nExperiments on real-world image tweets in both English and Chinese and other user generated content, show that VELDA significantly outperforms existing methods on cross-modality image retrieval. Even in other domains where emotion does not factor in image choice directly, our VELDA model demonstrates good generalization ability, achieving higher fidelity modeling of such multimedia documents.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Tao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Tao", "Hany M.
