Unlike traditional level-wise approaches which preserve the monotonicity of frequency, our block-wise approach preserves a form of monotonicity of the irreducibility and relevancy feature properties, which are important in propositionalization employed in the context of classification learning. With pruning based on these properties, our block-wise approach efficiently scales to features including tens of first-order literals, far beyond the reach of state-of-the art propositionalization or inductive logic programming systems.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "authors": ["Ondrej Kuzelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzelka:Ondrej", "Filip Zelezn\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zelezn=yacute=:Filip"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
