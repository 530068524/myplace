{"title": "SurfaceLink: using inertial and acoustic sensing to enable multi-device interaction on a surface.", "fields": ["inertial frame of reference", "accelerometer", "gesture", "contact microphone", "information transfer"], "abstract": "We present  SurfaceLink , a system where users can make natural surface gestures to control association and information transfer among a set of devices that are placed on a mutually shared surface ( e.g. , a table). SurfaceLink uses a combination of on-device accelerometers, vibration motors, speakers and microphones (and, optionally, an off-device contact microphone for greater sensitivity) to sense gestures performed on the shared surface. In a controlled evaluation with 10 participants, SurfaceLink detected the presence of devices on the same surface with 97.7% accuracy, their relative arrangement with 89.4% accuracy, and various single- and multi-touch surface gestures with an average accuracy of 90.3%. A usability analysis showed that SurfaceLink has advantages over current multi-device interaction techniques in a number of situations.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mayank Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Mayank", "Brendan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Brendan", "Md Tanvir Islam Aumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aumi:Md_Tanvir_Islam", "Shwetak Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Shwetak", "Gaetano Borriello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borriello:Gaetano", "Stacie Hibino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hibino:Stacie", "Bo Begole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Begole:Bo"], "pages": 10}
