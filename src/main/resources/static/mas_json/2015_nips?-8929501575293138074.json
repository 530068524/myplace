We proffer a new, efficient deep structured model learning scheme, in which we show how deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to directly estimate the messages in message passing inference for structured prediction with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). With such CNN message estimators, we obviate the need to learn or evaluate potential functions for message calculation. This confers significant efficiency for learning, since otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient iteration. The network output dimension of message estimators is the same as the number of classes, rather than exponentially growing in the order of the potentials. Hence it is more scalable for cases that involve a large number of classes. We apply our method to semantic image segmentation and achieve impressive performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of our CNN message learning method.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Guosheng Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Guosheng", "Chunhua Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chunhua", "Ian D.
