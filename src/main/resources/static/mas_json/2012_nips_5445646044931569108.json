{"title": "A Polynomial-time Form of Robust Regression.", "fields": ["time complexity", "robust regression", "robustness", "leverage", "estimator"], "abstract": "Despite the variety of robust regression methods that have been developed, current regression formulations are either NP-hard, or allow unbounded response to even a single leverage point. We present a general formulation for robust regression\u2014Variational M-estimation\u2014that unifies a number of robust regression methods while allowing a tractable approximation strategy. We develop an estimator that requires only polynomial-time, while achieving certain robustness and consistency guarantees. An experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the new estimation approach compared to standard methods.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Yaoliang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yaoliang", "\u00d6zlem Aslan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aslan:=Ouml=zlem", "Dale Schuurmans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuurmans:Dale"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
