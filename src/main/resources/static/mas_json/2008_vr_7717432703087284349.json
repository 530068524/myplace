In this paper, we demonstrate that MMOs also provide a powerful platform for Augmented Reality (AR) applications, where we blend together locations in physical space with corresponding places in the virtual world. We introduce the notion of AR stages, which are persistent, evolving spaces that encapsulate AR experiences in online three-dimensional virtual worlds. We discuss the concepts and technology necessary to use an MMO for AR, including a novel set of design concepts aimed at keeping such a system easy to learn and use. By leveraging the features of the commercial MMO Second Life, we have created a powerful AR authoring environment accessible to a large, diverse set of users.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Deusto"], "authors": ["Tobias Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang_0003:Tobias", "Blair MacIntyre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/MacIntyre:Blair", "Iker Jamardo Zugaza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zugaza:Iker_Jamardo"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
