{"title": "ProgXe: progressive result generation framework for multi-criteria decision support queries.", "fields": ["decision support system", "skyline", "abstraction", "joins", "visualization"], "abstract": "We demonstrate  ProgXe , a practical approach to support Multi-Criteria Decision Support (MCDS) applications that need to report results as they are being generated to enable the user to make competitive decisions.  ProgXe  transforms the execution of MCDS queries involving skyline over joins to be  non-blocking  by progressively generating results early and often. The demonstration highlights key features of our progressive execution framework that optimizes for early output generation by: (1) evaluating the query at multiple levels of abstraction, (2) exploiting the skyline knowledge gained from both input as well as mapped output spaces. The audience will be able to submit MCDS queries. We provide visualization tools that enable the user to make quick decisions, compare alternative techniques, and provide capability to fine-tune the query predicates based on the early output results.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Venkatesh Raghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavan:Venkatesh", "Elke A.
