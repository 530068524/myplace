S4, have been primarily focusing on adapting to varying event rates. However, as these systems are becoming increasingly multi-tenant, adaptation to the varying query load is becoming an equally important problem. In this paper we present FUGU \u2013 an elastic allocator for Complex Event Processing systems. FUGU uses bin packing to allocate continuous queries to a varying set of nodes. Driven by elasticity requirements FUGU maximizes the overall system utilization while trying to maintain stable processing latencies. The specific contributions of this paper are: (1) introduction of a re-balancing scheme for bin packing allowing FUGU to increase overall system utilization by six percent and (2) a detailed study of achievable system utilization and latency under real-life workload from Frankfurt Stock Exchange.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Thomas Heinze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinze_0001:Thomas", "Yuanzhen Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Yuanzhen", "Yinying Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Yinying", "Franz Josef Gr\u00fcneberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=uuml=neberger:Franz_Josef", "Zbigniew Jerzak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jerzak:Zbigniew", "Christof Fetzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fetzer:Christof"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
