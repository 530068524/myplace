{"title": "Nested interpolants.", "fields": ["nested word", "algorithm", "craig interpolation", "predicate abstraction", "programming language"], "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the potential of the theory of nested words for partial correctness proofs of recursive programs. Our conceptual contribution is a simple framework that allows us to shine a new light on classical concepts such as Floyd/Hoare proofs and predicate abstraction in the context of recursive programs. Our technical contribution is an interpolant-based software model checking method for recursive programs. The method avoids the costly construction of the abstract transformer by constructing a nested word automaton from an inductive sequence of `nested interpolants' (i.e., interpolants for a nested word which represents an infeasible error trace).", "citation": "Citations (100)", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "authors": ["Matthias Heizmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heizmann:Matthias", "Jochen Hoenicke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoenicke:Jochen", "Andreas Podelski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podelski:Andreas"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
