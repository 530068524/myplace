{"title": "Cross Modal Deep Model and Gaussian Process Based Model for MSR-Bing Challenge.", "fields": ["deep learning", "convolutional neural network", "feature", "modal", "ranking"], "abstract": "In the MSR-Bing Image Retrieval Challenge, the contestants are required to design a system that can score the query-image pairs based on the relevance between queries and images. To address this problem, we propose a regression based cross modal deep learning model and a Gaussian Process scoring model. The regression based cross modal deep learning model takes the image features and query features as inputs respectively and outputs the relevance scores directly. The Gaussian Process scoring model regards the challenge as a ranking problem and utilizes the click (or pseudo click) information from both the training set and the development set to predict the relevance scores. The proposed models are used in different situations: matched and miss-matched queries. Experiments on the development set show the effectiveness of the proposed models.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Jian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jian", "Cuicui Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Cuicui", "Yonghao He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yonghao", "Shiming Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Shiming", "Chunhong Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Chunhong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
