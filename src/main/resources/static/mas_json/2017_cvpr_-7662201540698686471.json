In contrast to previous approaches, we first directly determine the cameras attitude by employing the corresponding geometric constraints to formulate a system of trigonometric equations. This is then efficiently solved, following an algebraic approach, to determine the unknown rotation matrix and subsequently the cameras position. As compared to recent alternatives, our method avoids computing unnecessary (and potentially numerically unstable) intermediate results, and thus achieves higher numerical accuracy and robustness at a lower computational cost. These benefits are validated through extensive Monte-Carlo simulations for both nominal and close-to-singular geometric configurations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "Computer Scienc ... and Engineering"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tong Ke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ke:Tong", "Stergios I.
