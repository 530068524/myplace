{"title": "GiSS: Combining Gibbs Sampling and SampleSearch for Inference in Mixed Probabilistic and Deterministic Graphical Models.", "fields": ["determinism", "importance sampling", "probabilistic logic", "markov chain monte carlo", "belief propagation"], "abstract": "Mixed probabilistic and deterministic graphical models are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Unfortunately, Gibbs sampling, a popular MCMC technique, does not converge to the correct answers in presence of determinism and therefore cannot be used for inference in such models. In this paper, we propose to remedy this problem by combining Gibbs sampling with SampleSearch, an advanced importance sampling technique which leverages complete SAT/CSP solvers to generate high quality samples from hard deterministic spaces. We call the resulting algorithm, GiSS. Unlike Gibbs sampling which yields unweighted samples, GiSS yields weighted samples. Computing these weights exactly can be computationally expensive and therefore we propose several approximations. We show that our approximate weighting schemes yield consistent estimates and demonstrate experimentally that GiSS is competitive in terms of accuracy with state-of-the-art algorithms such as Sample Search, MC-SAT and Belief propagation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Deepak Venugopal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venugopal:Deepak", "Vibhav Gogate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gogate:Vibhav"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
