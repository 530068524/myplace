Scene attributes such as object velocity, scene density, and user's cursor velocity can impact the user's ability to accurately select an object. Many 3D selection techniques have been explored, and are usually optimal for a specific set of conditions. As a result, software developers must compromise by choosing a single technique that works well on average, but is lacking in at least one scenario. We present a preliminary study that explores the feasibility of new autoselection algorithms that automatically determines the most appropriate selection technique in real-time, thus leveraging the performance benefits of each technique. We evaluated the techniques across three levels of scene density and three levels of object velocity.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["Jeffrey Cashion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cashion:Jeffrey", "Chadwick A.
