In such situations, we may want to preprocess the information given by the subelectorate (consisting of the voters who have expressed their votes) so as to \"compile\" the known votes for the time when the latecomers have expressed their votes. We study the amount of space necessary for such a compilation, as a function of the voting rule, the number of candidates, and the number of votes already known. We relate our results to existing work, especially on communication complexity.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University", "Paris Dauphine University", "Paris Dauphine University", "Paris Dauphine University"], "authors": ["Yann Chevaleyre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chevaleyre:Yann", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Nicolas Maudet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maudet:Nicolas", "Guillaume Ravilly-Abadie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravilly=Abadie:Guillaume"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
