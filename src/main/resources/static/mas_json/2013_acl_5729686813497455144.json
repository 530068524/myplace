{"title": "FrameNet on the Way to Babel: Creating a Bilingual FrameNet Using Wiktionary as Interlingual Connection.", "fields": ["framenet", "german", "lexicon", "linguistics", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We present a new bilingual FrameNet lexicon for English and German. It is created through a simple, but powerful approach to construct a FrameNet in any language using Wiktionary as an interlingual representation. Our approach is based on a sense alignment of FrameNet and Wiktionary, and subsequent translation disambiguation into the target language. We perform a detailed evaluation of the created resource and a discussion of Wiktionary as an interlingual connection for the cross-language transfer of lexicalsemantic resources. The created resource is publicly available at http://www. ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/fnwkde/.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Silvana Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartmann:Silvana", "Iryna Gurevych.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurevych:Iryna"], "pages": 11}
