As color constancy is inherently an ill-posed problem, most of the existing color constancy algorithms are based on specific imaging assumptions such as the grey-world and white patch assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Beijing Jiaotong University", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "Beijing Jiaotong University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Rui Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Rui", "Arjan Gijsenij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gijsenij:Arjan", "Theo Gevers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gevers:Theo", "Vladimir Nedovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nedovic:Vladimir", "De Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:De", "Jan-Mark Geusebroek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geusebroek:Jan=Mark"], "pages": 8}
