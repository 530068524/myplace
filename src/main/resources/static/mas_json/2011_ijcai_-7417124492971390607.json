It requires only normal data for training and works well when anomalous data are rare. The model features an ensemble of random HS-Trees, and the tree structure is constructed without any data. This makes the method highly efficient because it requires no model restructuring when adapting to evolving data streams. Our analysis shows that Streaming HS-Trees has constant amortised time complexity and constant memory requirement. When compared with a state-of-the-art method, our method performs favourably in terms of detection accuracy and runtime performance. Our experimental results also show that the detection performance of Streaming HS-Trees is not sensitive to its parameter settings.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["SIM University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Swee Chuan Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Swee_Chuan", "Kai Ming Ting.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Ting:Kai_Ming", "Fei Tony Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Fei_Tony"], "pages": 6}
