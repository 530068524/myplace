We describe a controlled experiment where 19 participants used focus+context, overview+detail, and zooming techniques with varying display sizes (13.8, 1.5, and 0.17 megapixels). Participants navigated geographical maps to find specific locations, compare items, and follow routes. Results show that for multi-scale navigation, classic interactive visualization techniques did not benefit from being scaled to a large display: In contrast to the literature we find similar performance on medium and large displays. Across display sizes, overview+detail works the best, in particular for comparing items. Focus+context is relatively more difficult to use at a small display size. We explain these findings and discuss the design of interactive visualization techniques for large displays.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mikkel R\u00f8nne Jakobsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jakobsen:Mikkel_R=oslash=nne", "Kasper Hornb\u00e6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hornb=aelig=k:Kasper"], "pages": 10}
