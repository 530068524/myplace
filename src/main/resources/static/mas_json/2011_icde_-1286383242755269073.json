{"title": "CT-index: Fingerprint-based graph indexing combining cycles and trees.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "database index", "scaffold", "maximum common subgraph isomorphism problem", "subgraph isomorphism problem"], "abstract": "Efficient subgraph queries in large databases are a time-critical task in many application areas as e.g. biology or chemistry, where biological networks or chemical compounds are modeled as graphs. The NP-completeness of the underlying subgraph isomorphism problem renders an exact subgraph test for each database graph infeasible. Therefore efficient methods have to be found that avoid most of these tests but still allow to identify all graphs containing the query pattern. We propose a new approach based on the filter-verification paradigm, using a new hash-key fingerprint technique with a combination of tree and cycle features for filtering and a new subgraph isomorphism test for verification. Our approach is able to cope with edge and vertex labels and also allows to use wild card patterns for the search. We present an experimental comparison of our approach with state-of-the-art methods using a benchmark set of both real world and generated graph instances that shows its practicability. Our approach is implemented as part of the Scaffold Hunter software, a tool for the visual analysis of chemical compound databases.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Technical University of Dortmund", "Technical University of Dortmund", "Technical University of Dortmund"], "authors": ["Karsten Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein_0001:Karsten", "Nils Kriege.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kriege:Nils", "Petra Mutzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mutzel:Petra"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
