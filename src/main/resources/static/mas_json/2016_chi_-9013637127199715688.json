{"title": "Transition Resilience with ICTs: 'Identity Awareness' in Veteran Re-Integration.", "fields": ["social media", "civil society", "icts", "psychological resilience", "social structure"], "abstract": "This paper reports on a qualitative interview study of ICT use amongst a population undergoing transition following a life disruption. We interviewed 13 veterans who were re-integrating into civil society. Veterans are unique in that they experience several transitions at once-that is, after returning home, they often suffer from PTSD, become homeless, change occupations, etc. Amongst other things, veterans often undergo identity crises as caused by the lack of continuity between military and civilian social structures. We show how veterans are resilient through their uses of ICTs when navigating identity crises. We find that they use ICTs to develop identity awareness-that is, they connect with a human infrastructure through which they can develop a \"big picture\" understanding of unfamiliar rules and norms and receive support when navigating civil society. We discuss the implications of our study and identify implications for design.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Syracuse University", "Syracuse University", "Syracuse University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Bryan C.
