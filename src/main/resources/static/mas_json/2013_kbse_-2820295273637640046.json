{"title": "Dangling references in multi-configuration and dynamic PHP-based Web applications.", "fields": ["symbolic execution", "dangling pointer", "javascript", "web development", "declaration"], "abstract": "PHP is a dynamic language popularly used in Web development for writing server-side code to dynamically create multiple versions of client-side pages at run time for different configurations. A PHP program contains code to be executed or produced for multiple configurations/versions. That  dynamism  and  multi-configuration  nature leads to  dangling references . Specifically, in the execution for a configuration, a reference to a variable or a call to a function is dangling if its corresponding declaration cannot be found. We conducted an exploratory study to confirm the existence of such dangling reference errors including dangling  cross-language  and  embedded references  in the clientside HTML/JavaScript code and in data-accessing SQL code that are embedded in scattered PHP code. Dangling references have caused run-time fatal failures and security vulnerabilities.   We developed DRC, a static analysis method to detect such dangling references. DRC uses symbolic execution to collect PHP declarations/references and to approximate all versions of the generated output, and then extracts embedded declarations/references. It associates each detected declaration/reference with a conditional constraint that represents the execution paths (i.e. configurations/versions) containing that declaration/reference. It then validates references against declarations via a novel dangling reference detection algorithm. Our empirical evaluation shows that DRC detects dangling references with high accuracy. It revealed 83 yet undiscovered defects caused by dangling references.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Hung Viet Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hung_Viet", "Hoan Anh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hoan_Anh", "Tung Thanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tung_Thanh", "Anh Tuan Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen_0001:Anh_Tuan", "Tien N.
