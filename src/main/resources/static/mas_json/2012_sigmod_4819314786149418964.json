We consider the problem of processing a large number of continuous top- k  queries, each with its own preference. When objects or user preferences change, the query results must be updated. We present a dynamic index that supports the  reverse top k query , which is of independent interest. Combining this index with another one for  top-k  queries, we develop a scalable solution for processing many continuous top- k  queries that exploits the clusteredness in user preferences. We also define an approximate version of the problem and present a solution significantly more efficient than the exact one with little loss in accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Albert Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Albert", "Pankaj K.
