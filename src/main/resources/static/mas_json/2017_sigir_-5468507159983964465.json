EBM relies on effective access to peer-reviewed literature - a task hampered by both the exponential growth of medical literature and a lack of efficient and effective means of searching and presenting this literature. This paper describes a search engine specifically designed for searching medical literature for the purpose of EBM and in a clinical decision support setting.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Queensland University of Technology", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"], "authors": ["Bevan Koopman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koopman:Bevan", "Guido Zuccon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuccon:Guido", "Jack Russell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Russell:Jack"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
