{"title": "Modeling Attempt and Action Failure in Probabilistic STIT Logic.", "fields": ["exertion", "liability", "formalism", "probabilistic logic", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We define an extension of stit logic that encompasses subjective probabilities representing beliefs about simultaneous choice exertion of other agents. The formalism enables us to express the notion of 'attempt' as a choice exertion that maximizes the chance of success with respect to an action effect. The notion of attempt (or effort) is central in philosophical and legal discussions on responsibility and liability.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Utrecht University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jan M.
