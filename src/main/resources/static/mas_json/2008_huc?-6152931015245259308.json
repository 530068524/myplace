However, ESM studies often demand too much time and commitment from participants, which leads to attrition and low compliance among participants. We introduce a new approach called  experience sampling with feedback  or  ES+feedback  that improves compliance by giving feedback to participants through various visualizations. Providing feedback to users makes the information personally relevant and increases the value of the study to participants, which increases their compliance. Our exploratory study shows that  ES+feedback  increases the compliance rate by 23%.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Gary Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Gary", "Ian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ian", "Anind K.
