{"title": "On the Diagnosis of Cyber-Physical Production Systems.", "fields": ["systems engineering", "simulation", "user friendly", "cyber physical system", "anomaly detection"], "abstract": "Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) are in the focus of research, industry and politics: By applying new IT and new computer science solutions, production systems will become more adaptable, more resource ef- ficient and more user friendly. The analysis and diagnosis of such systems is a major part of this trend: Plants should detect automatically wear, faults and suboptimal configurations. This paper reflects the current state-of- the-art in diagnosis against the requirements of CPPSs, identifies three main gaps and gives application scenarios to outline first ideas for potential solutions to close these gaps.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Ostwestfalen-Li ...
