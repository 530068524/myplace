For problems with countably infinite states, where classical methods such as matrix exponentiation are not applicable, the main alternative has been particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods imputing both the holding times and sequences of visited states. We propose a particle-based Monte Carlo approach where the holding times are marginalized analytically. We demonstrate that in a range of realistic inferential setups, our scheme dramatically reduces the variance of the Monte Carlo approximation and yields more accurate parameter posterior approximations given a fixed computational budget. These experiments are performed on both synthetic and real datasets, drawing from two important examples of CTMCs having combinatorial state spaces: string-valued mutation models in phylogenetics and nucleic acid folding pathways.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of Miami", "Simon Fraser University", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Monir Hajiaghayi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hajiaghayi:Monir", "Bonnie Kirkpatrick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirkpatrick:Bonnie", "Liangliang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Liangliang", "Alexandre Bouchard-C\u00f4t\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouchard=C=ocirc=t=eacute=:Alexandre"], "pages": 9}
