The control plane is assumed to have a global knowledge of the underlying physical and/or logical network topology so that it can monitor, abstract and control the forwarding plane. In our paper, we present solutions that install an optimal or near-optimal (i.e., within 14% of the optimal) number of static forwarding rules on switches/routers so that any controller can verify the topology connectivity and detect/locate link failures at data plane speeds without relying on state updates from other controllers. Our upper bounds on performance indicate that sub-second link failure localization is possible even at data-center scale networks. For networks with hundreds or few thousand links, tens of milliseconds of latency is achievable.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo"], "authors": ["Ulas C.
