The key novelty of Synthia is the underlying abstraction refinement approach [5] that combines the efficient symbolic treatment of timing information by difference bound matrices (DBMs) with the usage of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for the discrete parts of the system description. Our experiments show that the analysis of both closed and open systems greatly benefits from identifying large relevant and irrelevant system parts on coarse abstractions early in the solution process.
