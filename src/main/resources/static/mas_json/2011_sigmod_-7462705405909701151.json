{"title": "GBLENDER: visual subgraph query formulation meets query processing.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "ranking", "web query classification", "sargable", "web search query"], "abstract": "Due to the complexity of graph query languages, the need for visual query interfaces that can reduce the burden of query formulation is fundamental to the spreading of graph data management tools to wider community. We present a novel HCI (human-computer interaction)-aware graph query processing paradigm, where instead of processing a query graph after its construction, it interleaves visual query construction and processing to improve system response time. We demonstrate a system called GBLENDER that exploits GUI latency to prune false results and prefetch candidate data graphs by employing a novel action-aware indexing scheme and a data structure called spindle-shaped graphs (SPIG). We demonstrate various innovative features of GBLENDER and its promising performance in evaluating subgraph containment and similarity queries.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Changjiu Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Changjiu", "Sourav S.
