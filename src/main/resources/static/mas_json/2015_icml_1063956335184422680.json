We present FActorized Natural Gradient (FANG), an approximation to natural gradient descent where the Fisher matrix is approximated with a Gaussian graphical model whose precision matrix can be computed efficiently. We analyze the Fisher matrix for a small RBM and derive an extremely sparse graphical model which is a good match to the covariance of the sufficient statistics. Our experiments indicate that FANG allows RBMs to be trained more efficiently compared with stochastic gradient descent. Additionally, our analysis yields insight into the surprisingly good performance of the \"centering trick\" for training RBMs.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Roger B.
