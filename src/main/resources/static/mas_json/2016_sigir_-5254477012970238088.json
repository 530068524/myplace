Recent work on FSD has focussed almost exclusively on efficiently detecting documents that are dissimilar from their nearest neighbor. We propose a novel FSD approach that is more effective, by adapting a recently proposed method for news summarization based on 3-nearest neighbor clustering. We show that this approach is more effective than a baseline that uses dissimilarity of an individual document from its nearest neighbor.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "authors": ["Jeroen B.
