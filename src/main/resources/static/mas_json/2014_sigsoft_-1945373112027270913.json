{"title": "SymJS: automatic symbolic testing of JavaScript web applications.", "fields": ["unobtrusive javascript", "ajax", "web design", "dynamic html", "dynamic web page"], "abstract": "We present SymJS, a comprehensive framework for automatic testing of client-side JavaScript Web applications. The tool contains a symbolic execution engine for JavaScript, and an automatic event explorer for Web pages. Without any user intervention, SymJS can automatically discover and explore Web events, symbolically execute the associated JavaScript code, refine the execution based on dynamic feedbacks, and produce test cases with high coverage. The symbolic engine contains a symbolic virtual machine, a string-numeric solver, and a symbolic executable DOM model. SymJS's innovations include a novel symbolic virtual machine for JavaScript Web, symbolic+dynamic feedback directed event space exploration, and dynamic taint analysis for enhancing event sequence construction. We illustrate the effectiveness of SymJS on standard JavaScript benchmarks and various real-life Web applications. On average SymJS achieves over 90% line coverage for the benchmark programs, significantly outperforming existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "departments": ["Fujitsu", "Aarhus University", "Fujitsu"], "authors": ["Guodong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Guodong", "Esben Andreasen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andreasen:Esben", "Indradeep Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Indradeep"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
