Our focus is on the aviation safety domain, where data objects are flights and time series are sensor readings and pilot switches. In this context the goal is to detect anomalous flight segments, due to mechanical, environmental, or human factors in order to identifying operationally significant events and highlight potential safety risks. For this purpose, we propose a framework which represents each flight using a semi-Markov switching vector autoregressive (SMS-VAR) model. Detection of anomalies is then based on measuring dissimilarities between the model's prediction and data observation. The framework is scalable, due to the inherent parallel nature of most computations, and can be used to perform online anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real datasets illustrate that the framework can detect various types of anomalies along with the key parameters involved.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center"], "authors": ["Igor Melnyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melnyk:Igor", "Arindam Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Arindam", "Bryan L.
