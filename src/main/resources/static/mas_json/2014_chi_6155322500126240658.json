It is often assumed that the reduction of visibility in audio and video conferencing may negatively impact the use of gesture to communicate, and thus negatively influence other outcomes. In this paper we \"Kinect-taped\" F2F and CMC communication in brainstorming groups by using motion sensors to record and analyze group members' hand movements during communication. We investigate how different media influence gesture use and gestural similarity, and how the use of gesture associates with level of understanding and brainstorming performance. Implications to future research and design are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Hao-Chuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hao=Chuan", "Chien-Tung Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Chien=Tung"], "pages": 10}
