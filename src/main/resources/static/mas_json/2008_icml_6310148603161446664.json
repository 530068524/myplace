{"title": "A dual coordinate descent method for large-scale linear SVM.", "fields": ["coordinate descent", "support vector machine", "pattern recognition", "sparse matrix", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In many applications, data appear with a huge number of instances as well as features. Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) is one of the most popular tools to deal with such large-scale sparse data. This paper presents a novel dual coordinate descent method for linear SVM with L1-and L2-loss functions. The proposed method is simple and reaches an  e -accurate solution in  O (log(1/ e )) iterations. Experiments indicate that our method is much faster than state of the art solvers such as Pegasos, TRON, SVM perf , and a recent primal coordinate descent implementation.", "citation": "Citations (782)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Cho-Jui Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Cho=Jui", "Kai-Wei Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kai=Wei", "Chih-Jen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chih=Jen", "S.
