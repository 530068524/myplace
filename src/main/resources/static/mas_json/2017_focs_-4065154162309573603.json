That is, we give a deterministic parallel algorithm which runs in O(\\log^3 n) time on n^{O(\\log^2 n)} processors. The result is obtained by a derandomization of the Isolation Lemma for perfect matchings, which was introduced in the classic paper by Mulmuley, Vazirani and Vazirani [1987] to obtain a Randomized NC algorithm.Our proof extends the framework of Fenner, Gurjar and Thierauf [2016], who proved the analogous result in the special case of bipartite graphs. Compared to that setting, several new ingredients are needed due to the significantly more complex structure of perfect matchings in general graphs. In particular, our proof heavily relies on the laminar structure of the faces of the perfect matching polytope.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Ola Svensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svensson:Ola", "Jakub Tarnawski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarnawski:Jakub"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
