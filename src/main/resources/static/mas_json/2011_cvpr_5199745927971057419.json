For each activity sequence, we know only the names of the objects which are present within it, and have no other knowledge regarding the appearance or location of objects. The key to our approach is a robust, unsupervised bottom up segmentation method, which exploits the structure of the egocentric domain to partition each frame into hand, object, and background categories. By using Multiple Instance Learning to match object instances across sequences, we discover and localize object occurrences. Object representations are refined through transduction and object-level classifiers are trained. We demonstrate encouraging results in detecting novel object instances using models produced by weakly-supervised learning.", "citation": "Citations (231)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Intel", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Alireza Fathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fathi:Alireza", "Xiaofeng Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiaofeng", "James M.
