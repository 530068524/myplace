{"title": "On Ridesharing Competition and Accessibility: Evidence from Uber, Lyft, and Taxi.", "fields": ["taxis", "lag", "sharing economy", "spatial econometrics", "data mining"], "abstract": "Ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft have become an important part of the Vehicle For Hire (VFH) market, which used to be dominated by taxis. Unfortunately, ridesharing services are not required to share data like taxis, which has made it challenging to compare the competitive dynamics of these services, or assess their impact on cities. In this paper, we comprehensively compare Uber, Lyft, and taxis with respect to key market features (supply, demand, price, and wait time) in San Francisco and New York City. Based on point pattern statistics, we develop novel statistical techniques to validate our measurement methods. Using spatial lag models, we investigate the accessibility of VFH services, and find that transportation infrastructure and socio-economic features have substantial effects on VFH market features.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Shan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Shan", "Le Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Le", "Alan Mislove.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mislove:Alan", "Christo Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Christo"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
