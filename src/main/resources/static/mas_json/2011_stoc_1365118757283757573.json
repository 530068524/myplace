{"title": "An LLL-reduction algorithm with quasi-linear time complexity: extended abstract.", "fields": ["lattice reduction", "matrix multiplication", "euclidean algorithm", "unimodular matrix", "transformation matrix"], "abstract": "We devise an algorithm, L1, with the following specifications: It takes as input an arbitrary basis B=(b i ) i  \u2208 Z d x d  of a Euclidean lattice L; It computes a basis of L which is reduced for a mild modification of the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz reduction; It terminates in time O(d 5+e  \u03b2 + d \u03c9+1+e  \u03b2 1+e ) where \u03b2 = log max |b i | (for any e>0 and \u03c9 is a valid exponent for matrix multiplication). This is the first LLL-reducing algorithm with a time complexity that is quasi-linear in \u03b2 and polynomial in d.   The backbone structure of L1 is able to mimic the Knuth-Schonhage fast gcd algorithm thanks to a combination of cutting-edge ingredients. First the bit-size of our lattice bases can be decreased via truncations whose validity are backed by recent numerical stability results on the QR matrix factorization. Also we establish a new framework for analyzing unimodular transformation matrices which reduce shifts of reduced bases, this includes bit-size control and new perturbation tools. We illustrate the power of this framework by generating a family of reduction algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Andrew Novocin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novocin:Andrew", "Damien Stehl\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stehl=eacute=:Damien", "Gilles Villard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villard:Gilles"], "pages": 10}
