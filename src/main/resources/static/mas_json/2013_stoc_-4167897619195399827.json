In this paper we construct a polynomial-time algorithm which finds either a perfect matching in H or a certificate that none exists. This essentially solves a problem of Karpinski, Rucinski and Szymanska, who previously showed that this problem is NP-hard for a minimum codegree of n/k - cn. Our algorithm relies on a theoretical result of independent interest, in which we characterise any such hypergraph with no perfect matching using a family of lattice-based constructions.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London", "University of Birmingham"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Peter Keevash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keevash:Peter", "Fiachra Knox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knox:Fiachra", "Richard Mycroft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mycroft:Richard"], "pages": 10}
