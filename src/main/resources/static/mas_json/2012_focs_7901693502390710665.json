The construction uses a modified learning graph approach. Compared to the recent paper by Belovs and Lee, the algorithm doesn't require any prior information on the input, and the complexity analysis is much simpler.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Latvia"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Aleksandrs Belovs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belovs:Aleksandrs"], "pages": 10}
