To make GPUs easier to program and easier to integrate with existing systems, we propose making the host's file system directly accessible from GPU code. GPUfs provides a POSIX-like API for GPU programs, exploits GPU parallelism for efficiency, and optimizes GPU file access by extending the buffer cache into GPU memory. Our experiments, based on a set of real benchmarks adopted to use our file system, demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of our approach. For example, we demonstrate a simple self-contained GPU program which searches for a set of strings in the entire tree of Linux kernel source files over seven times faster than an eight-core CPU run.", "citation": "Citations (103)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Yale University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Yale University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Mark Silberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silberstein:Mark", "Bryan Ford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ford:Bryan", "Idit Keidar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keidar:Idit", "Emmett Witchel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Witchel:Emmett"], "pages": 14}
