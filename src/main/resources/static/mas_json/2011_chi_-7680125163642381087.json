{"title": "Integrating user feedback with heuristic security and privacy management systems.", "fields": ["scripting language", "safeguard", "social navigation", "strengths and weaknesses", "heuristic"], "abstract": "Tools aimed at helping users safely navigate the web and safeguard themselves against potential online predators have become reasonably common. Currently there are two families of tools; heuristics analysis tools that test websites directly using automated scripts and programs, and community based tools where users rate websites and write reviews for the benefit of others. In this paper we examine the relative strengths and weaknesses of each technique, whether these techniques are compatible, and how community feedback can be combined with heuristic-based evaluations. In order to do this we conduct a large-scale comparison of the ratings of heuristic and community based tools, and explore novel methods for abstracting key information from user comments, which could be used to add context and nuance to heuristic based ratings. We find that heuristic and community based ratings are highly complementary, and can be combined to potentially guide users to make more informed decisions.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Prashanth Ayyavu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ayyavu:Prashanth", "Carlos Jensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jensen:Carlos"], "pages": 10}
