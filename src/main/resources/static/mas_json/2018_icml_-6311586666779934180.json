Time-to-event analysis, also called survival analysis, stands as one of the most representative examples of such statistical models. We present a novel deep-network-based approach that leverages adversarial learning to address a key challenge in modern time-to-event modeling: nonparametric estimation of event-time distributions. We also introduce a principled cost function to exploit information from censored events (events that occur subsequent to the observation window). Unlike most time-to-event models, we focus on the estimation of time-to-event distributions, rather than time ordering. We validate our model on both benchmark and real datasets, demonstrating that the proposed formulation yields significant performance gains relative to a parametric alternative, which we also propose.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Paidamoyo Chapfuwa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chapfuwa:Paidamoyo", "Chenyang Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Chenyang", "Chunyuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chunyuan", "Courtney Page.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Page:Courtney", "Benjamin Goldstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldstein:Benjamin", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence", "Ricardo Henao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henao:Ricardo"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
