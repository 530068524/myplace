In this paper, we propose a novel approach, namely DPMFS, to address this issue. The proposed approach is designed 1) to group documents into a set of clusters while the number of document clusters is determined by the Dirichlet process mixture model automatically; 2) to identify the discriminative words and separate them from irrelevant noise words via stochastic search variable selection technique. We explore the performance of our proposed approach on both a synthetic dataset and several realistic document datasets. The comparison between our proposed approach and stage-of-the-art document clustering approaches indicates that our approach is robust and effective for document clustering.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Nankai University"], "authors": ["Guan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Guan", "Rui-zhang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Rui=zhang", "Zhaojun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhaojun"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
