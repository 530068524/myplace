{"title": "Multiparty Computation for Dishonest Majority: From Passive to Active Security at Low Cost.", "fields": ["homomorphic encryption", "mathematical proof", "adversary", "zero knowledge proof", "commitment scheme"], "abstract": "Multiparty computation protocols have been known for more than twenty years now, but due to their lack of efficiency their use is still limited in real-world applications: the goal of this paper is the design of efficient two and multi party computation protocols aimed to fill the gap between theory and practice. We propose a new protocol to securely evaluate reactive arithmetic circuits, that offers security against an active adversary in the universally composable security framework. Instead of the \"do-and-compile\" approach (where the parties use zero-knowledge proofs to show that they are following the protocol) our key ingredient is an efficient version of the \"cut-and-choose\" technique, that allow us to achieve active security for just a (small) constant amount of work more than for passive security.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University"], "authors": ["Ivan Damg\u00e5rd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damg=aring=rd:Ivan", "Claudio Orlandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orlandi:Claudio"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2010", "pages": 19}
