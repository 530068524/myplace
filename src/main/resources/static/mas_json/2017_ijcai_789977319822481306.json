{"title": "Symbolic LTLf Synthesis.", "fields": ["graph", "computation", "true quantified boolean formula", "scalability", "the symbolic"], "abstract": "LTLf synthesis is the process of finding a strategy that satisfies a linear temporal specification over finite traces. An existing solution to this problem relies on a reduction to a DFA game. In this paper, we propose a symbolic framework for LTLf synthesis based on this technique, by performing the computation over a representation of the DFA as a boolean formula rather than as an explicit graph. This approach enables strategy generation by utilizing the mechanism of boolean synthesis. We implement this symbolic synthesis method in a tool called Syft, and demonstrate by experiments on scalable benchmarks that the symbolic approach scales better than the explicit one.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["East China Normal University", "Rice University", "East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Shufang Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Shufang", "Lucas M.
