Traditionally, this arises from heterogeneous channel SNRs at different receivers. In Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, a further heterogeneity is caused by different antenna numbers across receivers. We propose a compressive broadcast framework to address both types of heterogeneity. By layering compressive sensing (CS) over MIMO transmissions, our framework ensures a received source quality commensurate with the channel SNR and the MIMO channel dimension. Compared with a conventional framework, our framework achieves more smooth rate increase with channel SNR and much higher performance for multi-antenna receivers.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Xiao Lin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiao_Lin", "Chong Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Chong", "Wenjun Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Wenjun", "Feng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Feng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
