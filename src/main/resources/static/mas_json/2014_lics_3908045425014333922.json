The main feature of both type systems is a new form of channel polymorphism that affects their accuracy in a significant way: they are the first of their kind that can deal with recursive processes connected by cyclic networks.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Turin"], "authors": ["Luca Padovani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padovani:Luca"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
