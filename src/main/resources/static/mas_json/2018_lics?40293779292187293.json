{"title": "Allegories: decidability and graph homomorphisms.", "fields": ["graph", "isomorphism", "homomorphism", "treewidth", "decidability"], "abstract": "Allegories were introduced by Freyd and Scedrov; they form a fragment of Tarski's calculus of relations. We show that their equational theory is decidable by characterising it in terms of a specific class of graph homomorphisms.   We actually do so for an extension of allegories which we prove to be conservative: allegories with top. This makes it possible to exploit a correspondence between terms and K4-free graphs, for which isomorphisms were known to be finitely axiomatisable.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon"], "authors": ["Damien Pous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pous:Damien", "Valeria Vignudelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vignudelli:Valeria"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
