{"title": "Bayesian inference as iterated random functions with applications to sequential inference in graphical models.", "fields": ["change detection", "iterated function", "graphical model", "latent variable", "variable elimination"], "abstract": "We propose a general formalism of iterated random functions with semigroup property, under which exact and approximate Bayesian posterior updates can be viewed as specific instances. A convergence theory for iterated random functions is presented. As an application of the general theory we analyze convergence behaviors of exact and approximate message-passing algorithms that arise in a sequential change point detection problem formulated via a latent variable directed graphical model. The sequential inference algorithm and its supporting theory are illustrated by simulated examples.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Arash A.
