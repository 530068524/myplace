{"title": "Inter-context control-flow and data-flow test adequacy criteria for nesC applications.", "fields": ["interrupt", "interleaving", "nesc", "concurrency", "control flow"], "abstract": "NesC is a programming language for applications that run on top of networked sensor nodes. Such an application mainly uses an interrupt to trigger a sequence of operations, known as contexts, to perform its actions. However, a high degree of inter-context interleaving in an application can cause it to be error-prone. For instance, a context may mistakenly alter another context's data kept at a shared variable. Existing concurrency testing techniques target testing programs written in general-purpose programming languages, where a small scale of inter-context interleaving between program executions may make these techniques inapplicable. We observe that nesC blocks new context interleaving when handling interrupts, and this feature significantly restricts the scale of inter-context interleaving that may occur in a nesC application. This paper models how operations on different contexts may interleave as inter-context flow graphs. Based on these graphs, it proposes two test adequacy criteria, one on inter-context data-flows and another on inter-context control-flows. It evaluates the proposal by a real-life open-source nesC application. The empirical results show that the new criteria detect significantly more failures than their conventional counterparts.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Zhifeng Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Zhifeng", "Shing-Chi Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Shing=Chi", "Wing Kwong Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Wing_Kwong"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2008", "pages": 11}
