However, the accessibility difficulties pervasive in UGC warrant discussion and analysis distinct from other kinds of online content. Content authors, community culture, and the authoring tool itself all affect UGC accessibility. The choices, resources available, and strategies in use to ensure accessibility are different than for other types of online content. We contribute case studies of two UGC communities with accessible content: Wikipedia, where authors focus on access to visual materials and navigation, and an online health support forum where users moderate the cognitive accessibility of posts. Our data demonstrate real world moderation strategies and illuminate factors affecting success, such as community culture. We conclude with recommended strategies for creating a culture of accessibility around UGC.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Katie Kuksenok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuksenok:Katie", "Michael Brooks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brooks:Michael", "Jennifer Mankoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mankoff:Jennifer"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
