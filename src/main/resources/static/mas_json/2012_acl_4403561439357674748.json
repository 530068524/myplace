We build on prior work utilizing Wikipedia metadata and show how to effectively combine the weak annotations stemming from Wikipedia metadata with information obtained through English-foreign language parallel Wikipedia sentences. The combination is achieved using a novel semi-CRF model for foreign sentence tagging in the context of a parallel English sentence. The model outperforms both standard annotation projection methods and methods based solely on Wikipedia metadata.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sungchul Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sungchul", "Kristina Toutanova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toutanova:Kristina", "Hwanjo Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Hwanjo"], "pages": 9}
