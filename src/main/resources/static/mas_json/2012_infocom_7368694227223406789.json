By relying on slightly different assumption, we define two interesting problems, the k-traveling salesperson problem with neighborhood (k-TSPN) and the k-rooted path cover problem with neighborhood (k-PCPN). Since both problems are NP-hard, we propose constant factor approximation algorithms for them. Our simulation results indicate our algorithms outperform their alternatives.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["North Carolina Central University", "North Carolina Central University", "North Carolina Central University", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Donghyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Donghyun", "Baraki H.
