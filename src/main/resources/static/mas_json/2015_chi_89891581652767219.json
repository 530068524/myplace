The recognizer uses a nearest neighbor approach, and requires a small number of samples for each class. The similarity between two gestures is calculated through a three steps procedure: firstly, each gesture is approximated to a polyline, in order to extract its main movements; then, the two polylines are aligned to obtain an equal number of segments from both of them; lastly, the distance is found by summing the contribution of each pair of segments. We tested the recognizer on two different datasets and found that it performs more accurately than a state-of-art method.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Salerno", "University of Salerno"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Vittorio Fuccella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuccella:Vittorio", "Gennaro Costagliola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costagliola:Gennaro"], "pages": 4}
