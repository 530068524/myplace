However, they left as an open problem that of designing an encryption scheme that  simultaneously  provides security against both key dependent chosen plaintext  and  adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (KDM-CCA2 security). In this paper, we solve this problem. First, we show that by applying the Naor-Yung \"double encryption\" paradigm, one can combine any KDM-CPA secure scheme with any (ordinary) CCA2 secure scheme, along with an appropriate non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, to obtain a KDM-CCA2 secure scheme. Second, we give a concrete instantiation that makes use the above KDM-CPA secure scheme of BHHO, along with a generalization of the Cramer-Shoup CCA2 secure encryption scheme, and recently developed pairing-based NIZK proof systems. This instantiation increases the complexity of the BHHO scheme by just a small constant factor.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["IBM", "University of California, Los Angeles", "IBM"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Jan Camenisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camenisch:Jan", "Nishanth Chandran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandran:Nishanth", "Victor Shoup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shoup:Victor"], "pages": 18}
