Linear regression queries are fundamental to exploratory analytics and predictive modeling. However, computing their exact answers leaves a lot to be desired in terms of efficiency and scalability. We contribute a novel predictive analytics model and associated regression query processing algorithms, which are efficient, scalable and accurate. We focus on predicting the answers to two key query types that reveal dependencies between the values of different attributes: (i) mean-value queries and (ii) multivariate linear regression queries, both within specific data subspaces defined based on the values of other attributes. Our algorithms achieve many orders of magnitude improvement in query processing efficiency and nearperfect approximations of the underlying relationships among data attributes.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["Christos Anagnostopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anagnostopoulos:Christos", "Peter Triantafillou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Triantafillou:Peter"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
