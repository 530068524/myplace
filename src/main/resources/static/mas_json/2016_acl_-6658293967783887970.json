{"title": "Improving Coreference Resolution by Learning Entity-Level Distributed Representations.", "fields": ["machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "artificial neural network", "coreference", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "A long-standing challenge in coreference resolution has been the incorporation of entity-level information - features defined over clusters of mentions instead of mention pairs. We present a neural network based coreference system that produces high-dimensional vector representations for pairs of coreference clusters. Using these representations, our system learns when combining clusters is desirable. We train the system with a learning-to-search algorithm that teaches it which local decisions (cluster merges) will lead to a high-scoring final coreference partition. The system substantially outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the English and Chinese portions of the CoNLL 2012 Shared Task dataset despite using few hand-engineered features.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kevin Clark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clark:Kevin", "Christopher D.
