This paper shows a simple view of abduction in this context for the completion semantics, under which the problem of abduction becomes one of solving quantified equations and disequations. By this way of treating abduction, the problems with nonground negative queries in the previous approaches no longer exist. We show the soundness and completeness results for our approach.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Fangzhen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Fangzhen", "Jia-Huai You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Jia=Huai"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
