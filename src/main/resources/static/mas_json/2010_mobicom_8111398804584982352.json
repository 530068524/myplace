{"title": "Stix: a goal-oriented distributed management system for large-scale broadband wireless access networks.", "fields": ["internet access", "heterogeneous network", "wireless broadband", "distributed management", "management information systems"], "abstract": "Stix  is a platform managing emerging large-scale broadband wireless access (BWA) networks. It has been developed to make it easy to manage such networks for community deployments and wireless Internet service providers while keeping the network management infrastructure scalable and flexible.  Stix  is based on the notions of goal-oriented and in-network management. With  Stix , administrators graphically specify network management activities as workflows, which are deployed at a distributed set of agents within the network that cooperate in executing those workflows and storing management information. We implement the  Stix  system on embedded boards and show that the implementation has a low memory footprint. Using real topology and logging data from a large-scale BWA network operator, we show that  Stix  is significantly more scalable (via reduction in management traffic) compared to the commonly employed centralized management approach. Finally we use two case studies to demonstrate the ease with which  Stix  platform can be used for carrying out network reconfiguration and performance management tasks, thereby also showing its potential as a flexible platform to realize self-management mechanisms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Giacomo Bernardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernardi:Giacomo", "Matt Calder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calder:Matt", "Damon Fenacci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fenacci:Damon", "Alex Macmillan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Macmillan:Alex", "Mahesh K.
