{"title": "Generating High Quality Proposition Banks for Multilingual Semantic Role Labeling.", "fields": ["data mining", "proposition", "semantic role labeling", "natural language processing", "natural language understanding"], "abstract": "Semantic role labeling (SRL) is crucial to natural language understanding as it identifies the predicate-argument structure in text with semantic labels. Unfortunately, resources required to construct SRL models are expensive to obtain and simply do not exist for most languages. In this paper, we present a two-stage method to enable the construction of SRL models for resourcepoor languages by exploiting monolingual SRL and multilingual parallel data. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods. We use our method to generate Proposition Banks with high to reasonable quality for 7 languages in three language families and release these resources to the research community.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Alan Akbik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akbik:Alan", "Laura Chiticariu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiticariu:Laura", "Marina Danilevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danilevsky:Marina", "Yunyao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Yunyao", "Shivakumar Vaithyanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaithyanathan:Shivakumar", "Huaiyu Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Huaiyu"], "pages": 11}
