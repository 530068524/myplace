{"title": "Exploring the Ownership and Persistent Value of Facebook Content.", "fields": ["repurposing", "documentation", "reuse", "digital identity", "social media"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present the results of a study examining 244 participants' attitudes about the value, ownership, and control of social network data. We use Facebook-based scenarios to elicit reactions to hypothetical statements about saving social network content that belongs to others, reusing, repurposing, and monetizing social network data, and removing social network content that is not specifically one's own. Participants also report on their own practices in each of these areas. Findings not only address issues related to ownership, but also explore the use of social networks as documentary records, and the discrepancies between participants' perceptions of how they would like their social network content to be used, and how it is actually used.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Catherine C.
