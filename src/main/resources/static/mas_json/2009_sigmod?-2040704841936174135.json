We will demonstrate CAT, the Cornell Anonymization Toolkit, designed for interactive anonymization. CAT has an interface that is easy to use; it guides users through the process of preparing a dataset for publication while limiting disclosure through the identification of records that have high risk under various attacker models.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xiaokui Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Xiaokui", "Guozhang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guozhang", "Johannes Gehrke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehrke:Johannes"], "pages": 4}
