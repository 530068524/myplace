Through interviews and participatory observations with a group of people with motor disabilities in China, we found that their perceived limited capabilities to reciprocate, or feelings of indebtedness, were among the main reasons that kept them from interacting with others. The study shows that ICT and communities of people with disabilities are valuable in relieving these issues, in that they provide means and opportunities for them to give help and in turn develop self-esteem, crucial for their social interaction and integration. Our study suggests providing ways for them to give and not simply receive help as an important means to support their social interaction and integration\u00e2  in particular, by focusing on their abilities and communities, instead of disabilities and independence.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Peng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Peng", "Xianghua Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Xianghua", "Ning Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Ning"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
