Using this, we obtain an (\u03b1 1  + \u0454 \u2264 7.081 + \u0454)-approximation algorithm for  k -median with outliers, greatly improving upon the large implicit constant approximation ratio of Chen. For  k -means with outliers, we give an (\u03b1 2 +\u0454 \u2264 53.002 + \u0454)-approximation, which is the first  O (1)-approximation for this problem. The iterative algorithm framework is very versatile; we show how it can be used to give \u03b1 1 - and (\u03b1 1  + \u0454)-approximation algorithms for matroid and knapsack median problems respectively, improving upon the previous best approximations ratios of 8 due to Swamy and 17.46 due to Byrka et al. The natural LP relaxation for the  k -median/ k -means with outliers problem has an unbounded integrality gap. In spite of this negative result, our iterative rounding framework shows that we can round an LP solution to an  almost-integral  solution of small cost, in which we have at most two fractionally open facilities. Thus, the LP integrality gap arises due to the gap between almost-integral and fully-integral solutions. Then, using a pre-processing procedure, we show how to convert an almost-integral solution to a fully-integral solution losing only a constant-factor in the approximation ratio. By further using a sparsification technique, the additive factor loss incurred by the conversion can be reduced to any \u0454 > 0.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University at Buffalo", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ravishankar Krishnaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnaswamy:Ravishankar", "Shi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shi", "Sai Sandeep.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandeep:Sai"], "pages": 14}
