{"title": "Dictionary Learning with Mutually Reinforcing Group-Graph Structures.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "k svd", "discriminative model", "graph", "sparse approximation"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel dictionary learning method in the semi-supervised setting by dynamically coupling graph and group structures. To this end, samples are represented by sparse codes inheriting their graph structure while the labeled samples within the same class are represented with group sparsity, sharing the same atoms of the dictionary. Instead of statically combining graph and group structures, we take advantage of them in a mutually reinforcing way \u2014 in the dictionary learning phase, we introduce the unlabeled samples into groups by an entropy-based method and then update the corresponding local graph, resulting in a more structured and discriminative dictionary. We analyze the relationship between the two structures and prove the convergence of our proposed method. Focusing on image classification task, we evaluate our approach on several datasets and obtain superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, especially in the case of only a few labeled samples and limited dictionary size.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Hongteng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Hongteng", "Licheng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Licheng", "Dixin Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Dixin", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan", "Yi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
