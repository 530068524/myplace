{"title": "Bayesian CCA via Group Sparsity.", "fields": ["overfitting", "bayesian probability", "latent variable", "factorization", "canonical correlation"], "abstract": "Bayesian treatments of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) -type latent variable models have been recently proposed for coping with overfitting in small sample sizes, as well as for producing factorizations of the data sources into correlated and non-shared effects. However, all of the current implementations of Bayesian CCA and its extensions are computationally inefficient for high-dimensional data and, as shown in this paper, break down completely for high-dimensional sources with low sample count. Furthermore, they cannot reliably separate the correlated effects from non-shared ones. We propose a new Bayesian CCA variant that is computationally efficient and works for high-dimensional data, while also learning the factorization more accurately. The improvements are gained by introducing a group sparsity assumption and an improved variational approximation. The method is demonstrated to work well on multi-label prediction tasks and in analyzing brain correlates of naturalistic audio stimulation.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University", "University of Helsinki"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Seppo Virtanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Virtanen:Seppo", "Arto Klami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klami:Arto", "Samuel Kaski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaski:Samuel"], "pages": 8}
