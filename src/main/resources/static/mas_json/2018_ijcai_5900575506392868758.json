Current studies focus on crafting adversarial samples against DNN-based image classifiers by introducing some imperceptible perturbations to the input. However, DNNs for natural language processing have not got the attention they deserve. In fact, the existing perturbation algorithms for images cannot be directly applied to text. This paper presents a simple but effective method to attack DNN-based text classifiers. Three perturbation strategies, namely insertion, modification, and removal, are designed to generate an adversarial sample for a given text. By computing the cost gradients, what should be inserted, modified or removed, where to insert and how to modify are determined effectively. The experimental results show that the adversarial samples generated by our method can successfully fool a state-of-the-art model to misclassify them as any desirable classes without compromising their utilities. At the same time, the introduced perturbations are difficult to be perceived. Our study demonstrates that DNN-based text classifiers are also prone to the adversarial sample attack.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China"], "authors": ["Bin Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang_0002:Bin", "Hongcheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongcheng", "Miaoqiang Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Miaoqiang", "Pan Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Pan", "Xirong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xirong", "Wenchang Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Wenchang"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
