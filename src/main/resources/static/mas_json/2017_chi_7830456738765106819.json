As a mode of scientific inquiry, citizen science has the potential to \"scale up\" scientific data collection efforts and increase lay engagement with science. However, current technological directions risk losing sight of the ways in which citizen science is actually practiced. As citizen science is increasingly used to describe a wide range of activities, we begin by presenting a framework of citizen science genres. We then present findings from four interlocking qualitative studies and technological interventions of community air quality monitoring efforts, examining the motivations and capacities of citizen participants and characterizing their alignment with different types of citizen science. Based on these studies, we suggest that data acquisition involves complex multi-dimensional tradeoffs, and the commonly held view that citizen science systems are a win-win for citizens and science may be overstated.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Calgary", "Independent, ACM Member, USA", "Independent, ACM Member, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Paul M.
