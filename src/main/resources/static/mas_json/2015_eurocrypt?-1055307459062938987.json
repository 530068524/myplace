Our first contribution is a reduction from \\(\\mathrm {LWE}\\) to \\(\\mathrm {AGCD}\\). As a second contribution, we describe a new \\(\\mathrm {AGCD}\\)-based fully homomorphic encryption scheme, which outperforms all prior \\(\\mathrm {AGCD}\\)-based proposals: its security does not rely on the presumed hardness of the so-called Sparse Subset Sum problem, and the bit-length of a ciphertext is only \\(\\widetilde{O}(\\lambda )\\), where \\(\\lambda \\) refers to the security parameter.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Southern Nazarene University", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Jung Hee Cheon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheon:Jung_Hee", "Damien Stehl\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stehl=eacute=:Damien"], "pages": 24}
