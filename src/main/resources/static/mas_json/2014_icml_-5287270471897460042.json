{"title": "High Order Regularization for Semi-Supervised Learning of Structured Output Problems.", "fields": ["semi supervised learning", "cardinality", "labeled data", "discriminative model", "discrete optimization"], "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning, which uses unlabeled data to help learn a discriminative model, is especially important for structured output problems, as considerably more effort is needed to label its multi-dimensional outputs versus standard single output problems. We propose a new max-margin framework for semi-supervised structured output learning, that allows the use of powerful discrete optimization algorithms and high order regularizers defined directly on model predictions for the unlabeled examples. We show that our framework is closely related to Posterior Regularization, and the two frameworks optimize special cases of the same objective. The new framework is instantiated on two image segmentation tasks, using both a graph regularizer and a cardinality regularizer. Experiments also demonstrate that this framework can utilize unlabeled data from a different source than the labeled data to significantly improve performance while saving labeling effort.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yujia Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yujia", "Richard S.
