{"title": "Static Detection of Packet Injection Vulnerabilities: A Case for Identifying Attacker-controlled Implicit Information Leaks.", "fields": ["network packet", "packet injection", "linux kernel", "taint checking", "stream control transmission protocol"], "abstract": "Off-path packet injection attacks are still serious threats to the Internet and network security. In recent years, a number of studies have discovered new variations of packet injection attacks, targeting critical protocols such as TCP. We argue that such recurring problems need a systematic solution. In this paper, we design and implement PacketGuardian, a precise static taint analysis tool that comprehensively checks the packet handling logic of various network protocol implementations. The analysis operates in two steps. First, it identifies the critical paths and constraints that lead to accepting an incoming packet. If paths with weak constraints exist, a vulnerability may be revealed immediately. Otherwise, based on \"secret\" protocol states in the constraints, a subsequent analysis is performed to check whether such states can be leaked to an attacker.   In the second step, observing that all previously reported leaks are through implicit flows, our tool supports implicit flow tainting, which is a commonly excluded feature due to high volumes of false alarms caused by it. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of attacker-controlled implicit information leaks, and prioritize our tool to detect them, which effectively reduces false alarms without compromising tool effectiveness. We use PacketGuardian on 6 popular protocol implementations of TCP, SCTP, DCCP, and RTP, and uncover new vulnerabilities in Linux kernel TCP as well as 2 out of 3 RTP implementations. We validate these vulnerabilities and confirm that they are indeed highly exploitable.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of California, Riverside", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Qi Alfred Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qi_Alfred", "Zhiyun Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Zhiyun", "Yunhan Jack Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yunhan_Jack", "Yuru Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Yuru", "Zhuoqing Morley Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Zhuoqing_Morley"], "pages": 13}
