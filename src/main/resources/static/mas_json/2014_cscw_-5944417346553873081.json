{"title": "\"Figure out how to code with the hands of others\": recognizing cultural blind spots in global software development.", "fields": ["software development", "knowledge management", "vendor", "blind spot", "outsourcing"], "abstract": "We report on an ethnographic study of an outsourcing global software development (GSD) setup between an Indian IT vendor and an IT development division of a Danish bank. We investigate how the local IT development work is shaped by the global setup in GSD and argue that the bank had cultural blind spots toward the changes in Denmark. Three critical issues were neglected due to the cultural blind spots: 1) increased number of interruptions, 2) lack of translucence of remote colleagues' work, and 3) the re-definition of boundaries between work and articulation work. The implications of these findings include considerations for how to organize GSD practices and prepare the organizational changes that occur when moving from a co-located software development organization to an inter-organizational geographically distributed organization. Also, our findings open up discussions about the professional identity of IT developers within GSD, including extending the qualifications for IT developers.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Stina Matthiesen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthiesen:Stina", "Pernille Bj\u00f8rn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bj=oslash=rn:Pernille", "Lise M\u00f8ller Petersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petersen:Lise_M=oslash=ller"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 13}
