{"title": "A Generalised Twinning Property for Minimisation of Cost Register Automata.", "fields": ["monoid", "cardinality", "semiring", "commutative property", "of the form"], "abstract": "Weighted automata (WA) extend finite-state automata by associating with transitions weights from a semiring S, defining functions from words to S. Recently, cost register automata (CRA) have been introduced as an alternative model to describe any function realised by a WA by means of a deterministic machine. Unambiguous WA over a monoid (M, \u2297) can equivalently be described by cost register automata whose registers take their values in M, and are updated by operations of the form x: = y \u2297 c, with c \u2208 M. This class is denoted by CRA\u2297c(M).   We introduce a twinning property and a bounded variation property parametrised by an integer k, such that the corresponding notions introduced originally by Choffrut for finite-state transducers are obtained for k = 1. Given an unambiguous weighted automaton W over an infinitary group (G, \u2297) realizing some function f, we prove that the three following properties are equivalent: i) W satisfies the twinning property of order k, ii) f satisfies the k-bounded variation property, and iii) f can be described by a CRA\u2297c(G) with at most k registers.   In the spirit of tranducers, we actually prove this result in a more general setting by considering machines over the semiring of finite sets of elements from (G, \u2297): the three properties are still equivalent for such finite-valued weighted automata, that is the ones associating with words subsets of G of cardinality at most e, for some natural e. Moreover, we show that if the operation \u2297 of G is commutative and computable, then one can decide whether a WA satisfies the twinning property of order k. As a corollary, this allows to decide the register minimisation problem for the class CRA\u2297c(G).   Last, we prove that a similar result holds for finite-valued finite-state transducers, and that the register minimisation problem for the class CRA.c (B*) is Pspace-complete.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "Aix-Marseille University", "Aix-Marseille University"], "authors": ["Laure Daviaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daviaud:Laure", "Pierre-Alain Reynier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reynier:Pierre=Alain", "Jean-Marc Talbot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talbot:Jean=Marc"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
