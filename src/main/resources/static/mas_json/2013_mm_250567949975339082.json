The embedding of watermark bits in compressed domain is less computationally expensive as full decoding and re-encoding is not required. The motion coherency is an essential property to resist temporal frame averaging based attacks. The design of motion compensated embedding method in compressed domain is a challenging task. As far we know, no such embedding method is explored yet. In this paper, we propose a motion compensated compressed domain embedding method within a short video neighborhood that gives acceptable visual quality, embedding capacity, and robustness. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"], "authors": ["Tanima Dutta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dutta:Tanima"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
