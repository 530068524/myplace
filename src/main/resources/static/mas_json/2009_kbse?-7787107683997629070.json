{"title": "Reducing Features to Improve Bug Prediction.", "fields": ["naive bayes classifier", "software regression", "feature selection", "scalability", "source code"], "abstract": "Recently, machine learning classifiers have emerged as a way to predict the existence of a bug in a change made to a source code file. The classifier is first trained on software history data, and then used to predict bugs. Two drawbacks of existing classifier-based bug prediction are potentially insufficient accuracy for practical use, and use of a large number of features. These large numbers of features adversely impact scalability and accuracy of the approach. This paper proposes a feature selection technique applicable to classification-based bug prediction. This technique is applied to predict bugs in software changes, and performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers is characterized.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Shivkumar Shivaji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shivaji:Shivkumar", "E.
