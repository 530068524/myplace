{"title": "Action Schema Networks: Generalised Policies With Deep Learning.", "fields": ["deep learning", "probabilistic logic", "architecture", "artificial neural network", "schema"], "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the Action Schema Network (ASNet): a neural network architecture for learning generalised policies for probabilistic planning problems. By mimicking the relational structure of planning problems, ASNets are able to adopt a weight-sharing scheme which allows the network to be applied to any problem from a given planning domain. This allows the cost of training the network to be amortised over all problems in that domain. Further, we propose a training method which balances exploration and supervised training on small problems to produce a policy which remains robust when evaluated on larger problems. In experiments, we show that ASNet's learning capability allows it to significantly outperform traditional non-learning planners in several challenging domains.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Sam Toyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toyer:Sam", "Felipe W.
