{"title": "CoRED: browser-based Collaborative Real-time Editor for Java web applications.", "fields": ["code generation", "social media", "syntax", "microsoft visual studio", "web application"], "abstract": "While the users of completed applications are heavily moving from desktop to the web browser, the majority of developers are still working with desktop IDEs such as Eclipse or Visual Studio. In contrast to professional installable IDEs, current web-based code editors are simple text editors with extra features. They usually understand lexical syntax and can do highlighting and indenting, but lack many of the features seen in modern desktop editors. In this paper, we present CoRED, a browser-based collaborative real-time code editor for Java applications. CoRED is a complete Java editor with error checking and automatic code generation capabilities, extended with some features commonly associated with social media. As a proof of the concept, we have extended CoRED to support Java based Vaadin framework for web applications. Moreover, CoRED can be used either as a stand-alone version or as a component of any other software. It is already used as a part of browser based Arvue IDE.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology"], "authors": ["Janne Lautam\u00e4ki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lautam=auml=ki:Janne", "Antti Nieminen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nieminen:Antti", "Johannes Koskinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koskinen:Johannes", "Timo Aho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aho:Timo", "Tommi Mikkonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mikkonen:Tommi", "Marc Englund.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Englund:Marc"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
