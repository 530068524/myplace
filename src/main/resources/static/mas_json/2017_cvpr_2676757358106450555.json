{"title": "A Matrix Splitting Method for Composite Function Minimization.", "fields": ["matrix splitting", "symmetric matrix", "gaussian elimination", "non negative matrix factorization", "sparse matrix"], "abstract": "Composite function minimization captures a wide spectrum of applications in both computer vision and machine learning. It includes bound constrained optimization and cardinality regularized optimization as special cases. This paper proposes and analyzes a new Matrix Splitting Method (MSM) for minimizing composite functions. It can be viewed as a generalization of the classical Gauss-Seidel method and the Successive Over-Relaxation method for solving linear systems in the literature. Incorporating a new Gaussian elimination procedure, the matrix splitting method achieves state-of-the-art performance. For convex problems, we establish the global convergence, convergence rate, and iteration complexity of MSM, while for non-convex problems, we prove its global convergence. Finally, we validate the performance of our matrix splitting method on two particular applications: nonnegative matrix factorization and cardinality regularized sparse coding. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing composite function minimization techniques in term of both efficiency and efficacy.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "Sun Yat-sen University", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ganzhao Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Ganzhao", "Wei-Shi Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Wei=Shi", "Bernard Ghanem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghanem:Bernard"], "pages": 10}
