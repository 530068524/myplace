The synthesis results are obtained by copying patches from the source images in a globally consistent way. The patch copying problem is formulated with the Markov random field model, and belief propagation is used as the optimization tool. To speed up our algorithm, a two-step belief propagation and a multi-scale patch copying scheme are taken. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm obtains satisfactory results in both performance and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Jiayao Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Jiayao", "Shifeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shifeng", "Jianzhuang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jianzhuang", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
