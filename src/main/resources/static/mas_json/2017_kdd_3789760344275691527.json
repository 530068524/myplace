{"title": "Tracking the Dynamics in Crowdfunding.", "fields": ["the internet", "computer science", "decision making", "data mining"], "abstract": "Crowdfunding is an emerging Internet fundraising mechanism by raising monetary contributions from the crowd for projects or ventures. In these platforms, the dynamics, i.e., daily funding amount on  campaigns  and  perks  (backing options with rewards), are the most concerned issue for creators, backers and platforms. However, tracking the dynamics in crowdfunding is very challenging and still under-explored. To that end, in this paper, we present a focused study on this important problem. A special goal is to forecast the funding amount for a given campaign and its perks in the future days. Specifically, we formalize the dynamics in crowdfunding as a hierarchical time series, i.e.,  campaign level  and  perk level . Specific to each level, we develop a special regression by modeling the decision making process of the crowd (visitors and backing probability) and exploring various factors that impact the decision; on this basis, an enhanced switching regression is proposed at each level to address the heterogeneity of funding sequences. Further, we employ a revision matrix to combine the two-level base forecasts for the final forecasting. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world crowdfunding data collected from Indiegogo.com. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on tracking the dynamics in crowdfunding.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Arizona", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Hongke Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Hongke", "Hefu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hefu", "Yong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Yong", "Qi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Qi", "Enhong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Enhong", "Huayu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Huayu", "Le Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Le"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
