We assume that sensor deployment follows the Poisson distribution. For a given partial connectivity requirement \u03c1, 0.5  0 , around which the probability that at least a fraction \u03c1 of sensors are connected in the network increases sharply from e to 1-e within a short interval of sensor density \u03bb. The length of this interval is in the order of  O (\u2212log e/log  A ) as  A  \u2192 i, where  A  is the area of the sensor field, and the location of \u03bb 0  is at the sensor density where the aforesaid probability is about 1/2. We prove the preceding theoretical results in the hexagonal model. We also extend our results to the disk model that models transmission range of sensors as disks. Simulations are performed to confirm the analytical results.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis", "City University of Hong Kong", "Washington University in St. Louis", "University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis", "City University of Hong Kong", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "authors": ["Haiyan Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Haiyan", "Xiaohua Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Xiaohua", "Mo Sha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sha_0001:Mo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
