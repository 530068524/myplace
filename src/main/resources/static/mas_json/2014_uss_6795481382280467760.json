{"title": "Revisiting SSL/TLS Implementations: New Bleichenbacher Side Channels and Attacks.", "fields": ["implementation", "java secure socket extension", "hardware security module", "transport layer security", "ssl acceleration"], "abstract": "As a countermeasure against the famous Bleichenbacher attack on RSA based ciphersuites, all TLS RFCs starting from RFC 2246 (TLS 1.0) propose \"to treat incorrectly formatted messages in a manner indistinguishable from correctly formatted RSA blocks\".\n\nIn this paper we show that this objective has not been achieved yet (cf. Table 1): We present four new Bleichenbacher side channels, and three successful Bleichenbacher attacks against the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) SSL/TLS implementation and against hardware security appliances using the Cavium NITROX SSL accelerator chip. Three of these side channels are timing-based, and two of them provide the first timing-based Bleichenbacher attacks on SSL/TLS described in the literature. Our measurements confirmed that all these side channels are observable over a switched network, with timing differences between 1 and 23 microseconds. We were able to successfully recover the PreMasterSecret using three of the four side channels in a realistic measurement setup.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum", "M\u00fcnster University of Applied Sciences"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Christopher Meyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyer:Christopher", "Juraj Somorovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Somorovsky:Juraj", "Eugen Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:Eugen", "J\u00f6rg Schwenk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwenk:J=ouml=rg", "Sebastian Schinzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schinzel:Sebastian", "Erik Tews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tews:Erik"], "pages": 16}
