{"title": "Multispectral pedestrian detection: Benchmark dataset and baseline.", "fields": ["pedestrian detection", "multispectral image", "channel", "beam splitter"], "abstract": "With the increasing interest in pedestrian detection, pedestrian datasets have also been the subject of research in the past decades. However, most existing datasets focus on a color channel, while a thermal channel is helpful for detection even in a dark environment. With this in mind, we propose a multispectral pedestrian dataset which provides well aligned color-thermal image pairs, captured by beam splitter-based special hardware. The color-thermal dataset is as large as previous color-based datasets and provides dense annotations including temporal correspondences. With this dataset, we introduce multispectral ACF, which is an extension of aggregated channel features (ACF) to simultaneously handle color-thermal image pairs. Multi-spectral ACF reduces the average miss rate of ACF by 15%, and achieves another breakthrough in the pedestrian detection task.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Soonmin Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Soonmin", "Jaesik Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jaesik", "Namil Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Namil", "Yukyung Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Yukyung", "In So Kweon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kweon:In_So"], "pages": 9}
