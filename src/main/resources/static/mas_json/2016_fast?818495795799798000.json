{"title": "OrderMergeDedup: Efficient, Failure-Consistent Deduplication on Flash.", "fields": ["device mapper", "data deduplication", "metadata", "data consistency", "latency"], "abstract": "Flash storage is commonplace on mobile devices, sensors, and cloud servers. I/O deduplication is beneficial for saving the storage space and reducing expensive Flash writes. This paper presents a new approach, called OrderMergeDedup, that deduplicates storage writes while realizing failure-consistency, efficiency, and persistence at the same time. We devise a soft updates-style metadata write ordering that maintains storage data consistency without consistency-induced additional I/O. We further explore opportunities of I/O delay and merging to reduce the metadata I/O writes. We evaluate our Linux device mapper-based implementation using several mobile and server workloads--package installation and update, BBench web browsing, vehicle counting, Hadoop, and Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark. Results show that OrderMergeDedup can realize 18-63% write reduction on workloads that exhibit 23- 73% write content duplication. It has significantly less metadata write overhead than alternative I/O shadowing-based deduplication. Our approach has a slight impact on the application latency and may even improve the performance due to reduced I/O load.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Zhuan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhuan", "Kai Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Kai"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
