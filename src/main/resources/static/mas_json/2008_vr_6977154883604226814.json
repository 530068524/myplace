As VH experiences are increasingly being applied to training, it is important to understand the effect of immersive displays on user interaction with VHs. Results are reported from a user study (n=27) of 10 minute human-VH interactions in a VH experience which allows medical students to practice communication skills with VH patients. Results showed that student self-ratings of empathy, a critical doctor-patient communication skill, were significantly higher in the HMD; however, when compared to observations of student behavior, students using the large-screen display were able to more accurately reflect on their use of empathy. More work is necessary to understand why the HMD inhibits students' ability to self-reflect on their use of empathy.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Kyle Johnsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnsen:Kyle", "Benjamin Lok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lok:Benjamin"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
