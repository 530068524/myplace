{"title": "Mobility increases the connectivity of K-hop clustered wireless networks.", "fields": [], "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the connectivity for large-scale clustered wireless sensor and ad hoc networks. We study the effect of mobility on the critical transmission range for asymptotic connectivity in  k -hop clustered networks, and compare to existing results on non-clustered stationary networks. By introducing  k -hop clustering, any packet from a cluster member can reach a cluster head within  k  hops, and thus the transmission delay is bounded as \u0398(1) for any finite  k . We first characterize the critical transmission range for connectivity in mobile  k -hop clustered networks where all nodes move under either the random walk mobility model with non-trivial velocity or the i.i.d. mobility model. By the term  non-trivial velocity , we mean that the velocity of nodes  v  is \u0398(1). We then compare with the critical transmission range for stationary  k -hop clustered networks. We also study the transmission power versus delay trade-off and the average energy consumption per flow among different types of networks. We show that random walk mobility with non-trivial velocity increases connectivity in  k -hop clustered networks, and thus significantly decreases the energy consumption and improves the power-delay trade-off. The decrease of energy consumption per flow is shown to be \u0398(log n / n d  }) in clustered networks. These results provide insights on network design and fundamental guidelines on building a large-scale wireless network.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Qingsi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qingsi", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing", "Xiaojun Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xiaojun"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
