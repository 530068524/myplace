{"title": "Improving a Virtual Human Using a Model of Degrees of Grounding.", "fields": ["machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "ground"], "abstract": "We describe the Degrees of Grounding model, which tracks the extent to which material has reached mutual belief in a dialogue, and conduct experiments in which the model is used to manage grounding behavior in spoken dialogues with a virtual human. We show that the model produces improvements in virtual human performance as measured by post-session questionnaires.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["USC Institute f ... na del Rey, CA", "USC Institute f ... na del Rey, CA"], "authors": ["Antonio Roque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roque:Antonio", "David R.
