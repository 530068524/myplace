{"title": "A Family of Latent Variable Convex Relaxations for IBM Model 2.", "fields": ["regular polygon", "latent variable", "special case", "ibm", "multinomial distribution"], "abstract": "Recently, a new convex formulation of IBM Model 2 was introduced. In this paper we develop the theory further and introduce a class of convex relaxations for latent variable models which include IBM Model 2. When applied to IBM Model 2, our relaxation class subsumes the previous relaxation as a special case. As proof of concept, we study a new relaxation of IBM Model 2 which is simpler than the previous algorithm: the new relaxation relies on the use of nothing more than a multinomial EM algorithm, does not require the tuning of a learning rate, and has some favorable comparisons to IBM Model 2 in terms of F-Measure. The ideas presented could be applied to a wide range of NLP and machine learning problems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Andrei Arsene Simion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simion:Andrei_Arsene", "Michael Collins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collins_0001:Michael", "Cliff Stein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stein:Cliff"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
