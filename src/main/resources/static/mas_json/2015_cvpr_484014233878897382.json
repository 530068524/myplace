We present an interleaved text/image deep learning system to extract and mine the semantic interactions of radiology images and reports from a national research hospital's picture archiving and communication system. Instead of using full 3D medical volumes, we focus on a collection of representative \u223c216K 2D key images/slices (selected by clinicians for diagnostic reference) with text-driven scalar and vector labels. Our system interleaves between unsupervised learning (e.g., latent Dirichlet allocation, recurrent neural net language models) on document- and sentence-level texts to generate semantic labels and supervised learning via deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to map from images to label spaces. Disease-related key words can be predicted for radiology images in a retrieval manner. We have demonstrated promising quantitative and qualitative results. The large-scale datasets of extracted key images and their categorization, embedded vector labels and sentence descriptions can be harnessed to alleviate the deep learning \u201cdata-hungry\u201d obstacle in the medical domain.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hoo-Chang Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Hoo=Chang", "Le Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Le", "Lauren Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Lauren", "Ari Seff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seff:Ari", "Jianhua Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Jianhua", "Ronald M.
