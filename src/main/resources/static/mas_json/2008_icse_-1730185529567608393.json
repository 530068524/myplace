{"title": "Improving the handsets network test process via DMAIC concepts.", "fields": ["software development", "six sigma", "handset", "dmaic", "software deployment"], "abstract": "The wireless network evolution has allowed that the handset technology provides a broad and new set of resources and facilities to their users. However, this evolution is also increasing the number and complexity of testing prior to handsets deployment, so that there is a need to apply methodologies to ensure the quality of the test process while it evolves. This paper relates how the DMAIC framework could be used as an option to ensure and improve the quality of handsets network test processes. DMAIC is a six sigma framework based on measures and statistical analysis, which has commonly been applied during several stages of software development. Our focus, in this paper, is on the definition of the DMAIC phases and how this framework could be useful to stress problems and lead the effort of tests corrections and improvements.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung"], "authors": ["Clauirton de Siebra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siebra:Clauirton_de", "Paulo H.
