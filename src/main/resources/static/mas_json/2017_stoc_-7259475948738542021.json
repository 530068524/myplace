{"title": "Algorithmic discrepancy beyond partial coloring.", "fields": ["logarithm", "combinatorics", "random walk", "semidefinite programming", "iterated function"], "abstract": "The partial coloring method is one of the most powerful and widely used method in combinatorial discrepancy problems. However, in many cases it leads to sub-optimal bounds as the partial coloring step must be iterated a logarithmic number of times, and the errors can add up in an adversarial way. We give a new and general algorithmic framework that overcomes the limitations of the partial coloring method and can be applied in a black-box manner to various problems. Using this framework, we give new improved bounds and algorithms for several classic problems in discrepancy. In particular, for Tusnady\u00e2  s problem, we give an improved  O (log 2   n ) bound for discrepancy of axis-parallel rectangles and more generally an  O   d  (log  d   n ) bound for  d -dimensional boxes in \u00e2    d  . Previously, even non-constructively, the best bounds were  O (log 2.5   n ) and  O   d  (log  d +0.5  n ) respectively. Similarly, for the Steinitz problem we give the first algorithm that matches the best known non-constructive bounds due to Banaszczyk in the \u00e2   \u00e2    case, and improves the previous algorithmic bounds substantially in the \u00e2   2  case. Our framework is based upon a substantial generalization of the techniques developed recently in the context of the Komlos discrepancy problem.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Nikhil Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Nikhil", "Shashwat Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Shashwat"], "pages": 13}
