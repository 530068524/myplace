The inferred document relevance is potentially useful in evaluating the Web retrieval systems. In practice, it generally requires to acquire the accurate evaluation results within minimal users' query submissions. This problem is important for speeding up search engine development and evaluation cycle and acquiring reliable evaluation results on tail queries. In this paper, we propose a  reordering framework  for  efficient evaluation problem  in the context of clickthrough based Web retrieval evaluation. The main idea is to move up the documents that contribute more for the evaluation task. In this framework, we propose four intuitions and formulate them as an optimization problem. Both user study and TREC data based experiments validate that the reordering framework results in much fewer query submissions to get accurate evaluation results with only a little harm to the users' utility.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Beihang University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Jing He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Jing", "Wayne Xin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wayne_Xin", "Baihan Shu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shu:Baihan", "Xiaoming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiaoming", "Hongfei Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Hongfei"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
