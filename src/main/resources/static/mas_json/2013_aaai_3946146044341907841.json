{"title": "Domain-Specific Heuristics in Answer Set Programming.", "fields": ["solver", "truth value", "conflict driven clause learning", "predicate", "answer set programming"], "abstract": "We introduce a general declarative framework for incorporating domain-specific heuristics into ASP solving. We accomplish this by extending the first-order modeling language of ASP by a distinguished heuristic predicate. The resulting heuristic information is processed as an equitable part of the logic program and subsequently exploited by the solver when it comes to non-deterministically assigning a truth value to an atom. We implemented our approach as a dedicated heuristic in the ASP solver clasp and show its great prospect by an empirical evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam"], "authors": ["Martin Gebser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gebser:Martin", "Benjamin Kaufmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufmann:Benjamin", "Javier Romero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romero_0003:Javier", "Ram\u00f3n Otero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otero:Ram=oacute=n", "Torsten Schaub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaub:Torsten", "Philipp Wanko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wanko:Philipp"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
