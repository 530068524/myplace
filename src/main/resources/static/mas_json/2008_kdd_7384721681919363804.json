We consider the problem of automatically generating link-titles for URLs and propose a general statistical framework for solving this problem. The framework is based on using information from a diverse collection of sources, each of which can be thought of as contributing one or more candidate link-titles for the URL. It can also incorporate the context in which the link-title will be used, along with constraints on its length. Our framework is applicable to several scenarios: obtaining succinct titles for displaying quicklinks, obtaining titles for URLs that lack a good title, constructing succinct sitemaps, etc. Extensive experiments show that our method is very effective, producing results that are at least 20% better than non-trivial baselines.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Deepayan Chakrabarti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakrabarti:Deepayan", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi", "Kunal Punera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Punera:Kunal"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
