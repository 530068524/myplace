Automatic poetry generation is an essential step towards computer creativity. In recent years, several neural models have been designed for this task. However, among lines of a whole poem, the coherence in meaning and topics still remains a big challenge. In this paper, inspired by the theoretical concept in cognitive psychology, we propose a novel Working Memory model for poetry generation. Different from previous methods, our model explicitly maintains topics and informative limited history in a neural memory. During the generation process, our model reads the most relevant parts from memory slots to generate the current line. After each line is generated, it writes the most salient parts of the previous line into memory slots. By dynamic manipulation of the memory, our model keeps a coherent information flow and learns to express each topic flexibly and naturally. We experiment on three different genres of Chinese poetry: quatrain, iambic and chinoiserie lyric. Both automatic and human evaluation results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "6ESTATES PTE LTD, Singapore"], "authors": ["Xiaoyuan Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Xiaoyuan", "Maosong Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Maosong", "Ruoyu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ruoyu", "Zonghan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zonghan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
