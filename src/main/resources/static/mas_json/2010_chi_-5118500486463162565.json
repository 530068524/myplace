In this paper, I summarize the state of the art of feminism in HCI and propose ways to build on existing successes to more robustly integrate feminism into interaction design research and practice. I explore the productive role of feminism in analogous fields, such as industrial design, architecture, and game design. I introduce examples of feminist interaction design already in the field. Finally, I propose a set of femi-nist interaction design qualities intended to support design and evaluation processes directly as they unfold.", "citation": "Citations (310)", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Shaowen Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Shaowen"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
