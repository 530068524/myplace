In such scenario, we study how the teacher is still able to teach the learner to achieve a faster convergence rate than the traditional passive learning. We propose an active teacher model that can actively query the learner (i.e., make the learner take exams) for estimating the learner's status, and provide the sample complexity for both teaching and query, respectively. In the experiments, we compare the proposed active teacher with the omniscient teacher and verify the effectiveness of the active teacher model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Minnesota", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Weiyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Weiyang", "Bo Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Bo", "Xingguo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xingguo", "Zhen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhen", "James M.
