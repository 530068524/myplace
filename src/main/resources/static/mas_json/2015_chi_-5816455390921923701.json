A preliminary study with blind people reveals numerous difficulties with existing state-of-the-art technologies including problems with alignment, focus, accuracy, mobility and efficiency. In this paper, we present a finger-worn device, FingerReader, that assists blind users with reading printed text on the go. We introduce a novel computer vision algorithm for local-sequential text scanning that enables reading single lines, blocks of text or skimming the text with complementary, multimodal feedback. This system is implemented in a small finger-worn form factor, that enables a more manageable eyes-free operation with trivial setup. We offer findings from three studies performed to determine the usability of the FingerReader.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Nanyang Technological University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Singapore University of Technology and Design"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Roy Shilkrot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shilkrot:Roy", "Jochen Huber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huber:Jochen", "Wong Meng Ee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ee:Wong_Meng", "Pattie Maes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maes:Pattie", "Suranga Chandima Nanayakkara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanayakkara:Suranga_Chandima"], "pages": 10}
