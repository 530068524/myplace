{"title": "MightyL: A Compositional Translation from MITL to Timed Automata.", "fields": ["linear temporal logic", "interval temporal logic", "formalism", "buchi automaton", "syntax"], "abstract": "Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL ) was first proposed in the early 1990s as a specification formalism for real-time systems. Apart from its appealing intuitive syntax, there are also theoretical evidences that make MITL a prime real-time counterpart of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL ). Unfortunately, the tool support for MITL verification is still lacking to this day. In this paper, we propose a new construction from MITL to timed automata via very-weak one-clock alternating timed automata. Our construction subsumes the well-known construction from LTL to Buchi automata by Gastin and Oddoux and yet has the additional benefits of being compositional and integrating easily with existing tools. We implement the construction in our new tool MightyL and report on experiments using Uppaal and LTSmin as back-ends.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Mons", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "University of Mons", "Aix-Marseille University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Thomas Brihaye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brihaye:Thomas", "Gilles Geeraerts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geeraerts:Gilles", "Hsi-Ming Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Hsi=Ming", "Benjamin Monmege.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monmege:Benjamin"], "pages": 20}
