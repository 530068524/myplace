CD-DNN-HMMs greatly outperform conventional CD-GMM (Gaussian mixture model) HMMs: The word error rate is reduced by up to one third on the difficult benchmarking task of speaker-independent single-pass transcription of telephone conversations.", "citation": "Citations (745)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Dong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Dong", "Frank Seide.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seide:Frank", "Gang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0012:Gang"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
