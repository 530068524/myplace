{"title": "On low-latency-capable topologies, and their impact on the design of intra-domain routing.", "fields": ["latency", "shortest path problem", "traffic engineering", "network topology", "low latency"], "abstract": "An ISP's customers increasingly demand delivery of their traffic without congestion and with low latency. The ISP's topology, routing, and traffic engineering, often over multiple paths, together determine congestion and latency within its backbone. We first consider how to measure a topology's capacity to route traffic without congestion and with low latency. We introduce  low-latency path diversity  (LLPD), a metric that captures a topology's flexibility to accommodate traffic on alternative low-latency paths. We explore to what extent 116 real backbone topologies can, regardless of routing system, keep latency low when demand exceeds the shortest path's capacity. We find, perhaps surprisingly, that topologies with good LLPD are precisely those where routing schemes struggle to achieve low latency without congestion. We examine why these schemes perform poorly, and offer an existence proof that a practical routing scheme can achieve a topology's potential for congestion-free, low-delay routing. Finally we examine implications for the design of backbone topologies amenable to achieving high capacity and low delay.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Nikola Gvozdiev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gvozdiev:Nikola", "Stefano Vissicchio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vissicchio:Stefano", "Brad Karp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karp:Brad", "Mark Handley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Handley:Mark"], "pages": 15}
