It studies both large neighborhood (LNS) and adaptive randomized decomposition (ARD) schemes, using random, temporal, and machine decompositions. Empirical results on standard benchmarks show that, within 5 minutes, both LNS and ARD produce many new best solutions and are about 0.5% in average from the best-known solutions. Moreover, over longer runtimes, they improve 60% of the best-known solutions and match the remaining ones. The empirical results also show the importance of hybrid decompositions in LNS and ARD.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "Brown University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Dario Pacino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pacino:Dario", "Pascal Van Hentenryck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hentenryck:Pascal_Van"], "pages": 6}
