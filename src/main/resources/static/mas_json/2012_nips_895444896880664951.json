The classical l1 regularizer fails to promote sparsity on the probability simplex since l1 norm on the probability simplex is trivially constant. We propose a direct relaxation of the minimum cardinality problem and show that it can be efficiently solved using convex programming. As a first application we consider recovering a sparse probability measure given moment constraints, in which our formulation becomes linear programming, hence can be solved very efficiently. A sufficient condition for exact recovery of the minimum cardinality solution is derived for arbitrary affine constraints. We then develop a penalized version for the noisy setting which can be solved using second order cone programs. The proposed method outperforms known rescaling heuristics based on l1 norm. As a second application we consider convex clustering using a sparse Gaussian mixture and compare our results with the well known soft k-means algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mert Pilanci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilanci:Mert", "Laurent El Ghaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghaoui:Laurent_El", "Venkat Chandrasekaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandrasekaran:Venkat"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
