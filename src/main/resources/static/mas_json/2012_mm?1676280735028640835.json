Due to large intra-class variations presented in hand-drawn sketches, most of existing work was limited to a particular domain or limited pre-defined classes. Different from existing work, we target at developing a general sketch recognition system, to recognize any semantically meaningful object that a child can recognize. To increase the recognition coverage, a web-scale clipart image collection is leveraged as the knowledge base of the recognition system. To alleviate the problems of  intra-class shape variation  and  inter-class shape ambiguity  in this unconstrained situation, a query-adaptive shape topic model is proposed to mine object topics and shape topics related to the sketch, in which, multiple layers of information such as sketch, object, shape, image, and semantic labels are modeled in a generative process. Besides sketch recognition, the proposed topic model can also be used for related applications such as sketch tagging, image tagging, and sketch-based image search. Extensive experiments on different applications show the effectiveness of the proposed topic model and the recognition system.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Zhenbang Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Zhenbang", "Changhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Changhu", "Liqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Liqing", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lei"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
