We develop the first statistical machine learning approach for automatically discovering regression discontinuity designs (RDDs), a quasi-experimental setup often used in econometrics. Our method identifies interpretable, localized RDDs in arbitrary dimensional data and can seamlessly compute treatment effects without expert supervision. By applying the technique to a variety of synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate robust performance under adverse conditions including unobserved variables, substantial noise, and model", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Minnesota", "Cornell University", "New York University"], "authors": ["William Herlands.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herlands:William", "Edward McFowland III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McFowland_III:Edward", "Andrew Gordon Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Andrew_Gordon", "Daniel B.
