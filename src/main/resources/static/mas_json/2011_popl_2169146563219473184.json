{"title": "Delay-bounded scheduling.", "fields": ["context switch", "program analysis", "bounded function", "deterministic system", "static analysis"], "abstract": "We provide a new characterization of scheduling nondeterminism by allowing deterministic schedulers to delay their next-scheduled task. In limiting the delays an otherwise-deterministic scheduler is allowed, we discover concurrency bugs efficiently---by exploring few schedules---and robustly---i.e., independent of the number of tasks, context switches, or buffered events. Our characterization elegantly applies to any systematic exploration (e.g., testing, model checking) of concurrent programs with dynamic task-creation. Additionally, we show that certain delaying schedulers admit efficient reductions from concurrent to sequential program analysis.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["Paris Diderot University", "Microsoft", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Michael Emmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emmi:Michael", "Shaz Qadeer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qadeer:Shaz", "Zvonimir Rakamaric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rakamaric:Zvonimir"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
