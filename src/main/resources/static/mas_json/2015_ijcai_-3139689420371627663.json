{"title": "Computational Invention of Cadences and Chord Progressions by Conceptual Chord-Blending.", "fields": ["computer science", "chord", "algorithm", "conceptual blending", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "We present a computational framework for chord invention based on a cognitive-theoretic perspective on conceptual blending. The framework builds on algebraic specifications, and solves two musicological problems. It automatically finds transitions between chord progressions of different keys or idioms, and it substitutes chords in a chord progression by other chords of a similar function, as a means to create novel variations. The approach is demonstrated with several examples where jazz cadences are invented by blending chords in cadences from earlier idioms, and where novel chord progressions are generated by inventing transition chords.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Spanish National Research Council", "University of Edinburgh", "University of T ... loniki, Greece", "University of T ... loniki, Greece"], "authors": ["Manfred Eppe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eppe:Manfred", "Roberto Confalonieri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Confalonieri_0001:Roberto", "Ewen Maclean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maclean:Ewen", "Maximos A.
