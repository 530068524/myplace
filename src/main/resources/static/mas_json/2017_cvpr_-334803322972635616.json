Beam Search (BS) is a widely used approximate inference algorithm for decoding sequences from unidirectional neural sequence models. Interestingly, approximate inference in bidirectional models remains an open problem, despite their significant advantage in modeling information from both the past and future. To enable the use of bidirectional models, we present Bidirectional Beam Search (BiBS), an efficient algorithm for approximate bidirectional inference. To evaluate our method and as an interesting problem in its own right, we introduce a novel Fill-in-the-Blank Image Captioning task which requires reasoning about both past and future sentence structure to reconstruct sensible image descriptions. We use this task as well as the Visual Madlibs dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently outperforming all baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Qing Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Qing", "Stefan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Stefan", "Dhruv Batra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Batra:Dhruv"], "pages": 9}
