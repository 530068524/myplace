We present robust solutions to the problem of Non-Interactive Multiparty Computation in the computational and information-theoretic models. Our results include the first efficient and robust protocols to compute any function in \\(NC^1\\) for constant-size collusions, in the information-theoretic setting and in the computational setting, to compute any function in P for constant-size collusions, assuming the existence of one-way functions. Our constructions start from a Private Simultaneous Messages construction (Feige, Killian Naor, STOC 1994 and Ishai, Kushilevitz, ISTCS 1997) and transform it into a Non-Interactive Multiparty Computation for constant-size collusions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Fabrice Benhamouda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benhamouda:Fabrice", "Hugo Krawczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krawczyk:Hugo", "Tal Rabin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabin:Tal"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 29}
