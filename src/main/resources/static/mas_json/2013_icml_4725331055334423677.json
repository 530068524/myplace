{"title": "Dynamic Probabilistic Models for Latent Feature Propagation in Social Networks.", "fields": ["probabilistic latent semantic analysis", "latent variable", "probabilistic logic", "dynamic network analysis", "phenomenon"], "abstract": "Current Bayesian models for dynamic social network data have focused on modelling the influence of evolving unobserved structure on observed social interactions. However, an understanding of how observed social relationships from the past affect future unobserved structure in the network has been neglected. In this paper, we introduce a new probabilistic model for capturing this phenomenon, which we call latent feature propagation, in social networks. We demonstrate our model's capability for inferring such latent structure in varying types of social network datasets, and experimental studies show this structure achieves higher predictive performance on link prediction and forecasting tasks.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Creighton Heaukulani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heaukulani:Creighton", "Zoubin Ghahramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghahramani:Zoubin"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
