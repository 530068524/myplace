More recently, a cache utility maximization problem has been introduced, where contents have stationary popularities and utilities are strictly concave in the hit rates. This paper bridges the two formulations, considering linear costs and content popularities. We show that minimizing the retrieval cost corresponds to solving an online knapsack problem, and we propose new dynamic policies inspired by simulated annealing, including DynqLRU, a variant of qLRU. For such policies we prove asymptotic convergence to the optimum under the characteristic time approximation. In a real scenario, popularities vary over time and their estimation is very difficult. DynqLRU does not require popularity estimation, and our realistic, trace-driven evaluation shows that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art policies, with up to 45% cost reduction.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Institut Eur\u00e9com", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Verona", "Institut Eur\u00e9com"], "authors": ["Giovanni Neglia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neglia:Giovanni", "Damiano Carra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carra:Damiano", "Pietro Michiardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michiardi:Pietro"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
