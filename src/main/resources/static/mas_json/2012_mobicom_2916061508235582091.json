However, current wireless devices have yet to fully embrace DSA networks due to the difficulties in realizing spectrum-agile communications. We address the practical hurdles and present solutions towards implementing DSA devices, answering an important question \"what is a simple practical extension to current wireless devices that makes them spectrum-agile?\" To this end, we propose RODIN, a general per-frame spectrum-shaping protocol that has the following features to support DSA in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless devices: (a) direct manipulation of passband signals from COTS devices, (b) fast FPGA-based spectrum shaping, and (c) a novel preamble design for spectrum agreement. RODIN uses an FPGA-based spectrum shaper together with a preamble I-FOP to achieve per-frame spectrum shaping with a delay of under 10 \u03bc s.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Eugene Chai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chai:Eugene", "Jeongkeun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jeongkeun", "Sung-Ju Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sung=Ju", "Ra\u00fal H.
