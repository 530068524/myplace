The dilemma of handling WiFi broadcast traffic in smartphone suspend mode.", "fields": ["broadcasting", "multicast dns", "broadcast radiation", "broadcast domain"], "abstract": "Smartphones save energy by entering a low power suspend mode ( 120mW). As a result, power consumption increases dramatically. To improve energy efficiency, some phones employ a hardware broadcast filter in the WiFi driver. All UDP broadcast frames other than Multicast DNS frames are blocked, thus none is received by upper layer applications. So, we have a dilemma of handling WiFi broadcast traffic during smartphone suspend mode: either receive all of them suffering high power consumption, or receive none of them sacrificing functionalities. In this paper, we propose Software Broadcast Filter (SBF) to address the dilemma. SBF is smarter than the hardware broadcast filter as it only filters out useless broadcast frames and does not impair functionalities of applications. SBF is also more energy efficient than the \u201creceive all\u201d method. Our trace driven evaluation shows that SBF can save up to 52% energy consumption than the \u201creceive all\u201d method.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Ge Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Ge", "Gang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Gang", "David T.
