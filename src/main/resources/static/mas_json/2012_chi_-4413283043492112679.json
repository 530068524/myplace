Our methodology consisted of conducting interviews with designers and developers from the Drupal and Ubuntu communities (N=17) and analyzing a large corpus of interaction data collected from Drupal. The interviews captured user perspectives on the challenges of reaching consensus, techniques employed for building consensus, and the consequences of not reaching consensus. We analyzed the interaction data to determine how different elements of the content, process, and user relationships in the design discussions affect consensus. Our main result shows that design discussions engaging participants with more experience and prior interaction history are more likely to reach consensus. Based on all of our results, we formulated design implications for promoting consensus in distributed discussions of user interface design issues.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Sue Jamison-Powell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamison=Powell:Sue", "Conor Linehan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linehan:Conor", "Laura Daley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daley:Laura", "Andrew Garbett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garbett:Andrew", "Shaun W.
