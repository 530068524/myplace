Specifically, mobile applications can be executed in the mobile device (known as mobile execution) or offloaded to the cloud clone for execution (known as cloud execution), with an objective to conserve energy for mobile device. The energy-optimal execution policy is obtained by solving two constrained optimization problems, i.e., how to optimally configure the clock frequency to complete CPU cycles for mobile execution, and how to optimally schedule the data transmission for cloud execution in order to achieve the minimal energy within time delay. Closed-form solutions are obtained for both cases and applied to decide the optimal condition under whether the local execution or the remote execution is more energy-efficient for the mobile device. Moreover, numerical results illustrate that a significant amount of energy (e.g., up to 13 times for a typical mobile application profile) can be saved by optimally offloading the mobile application to the cloud clone.", "citation": "Citations (187)", "departments": ["China Mobile", "School of Compu ... ingapore 639798", "School of Compu ... ingapore 639798"], "authors": ["Yonggang Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Yonggang", "Weiwen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Weiwen", "Haiyun Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Haiyun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
