{"title": "Feedforward semantic segmentation with zoom-out features.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "test set", "scale space segmentation", "feature detection", "structured prediction"], "abstract": "We introduce a purely feed-forward architecture for semantic segmentation. We map small image elements (superpixels) to rich feature representations extracted from a sequence of nested regions of increasing extent. These regions are obtained by \u201czooming out\u201d from the superpixel all the way to scene-level resolution. This approach exploits statistical structure in the image and in the label space without setting up explicit structured prediction mechanisms, and thus avoids complex and expensive inference. Instead superpixels are classified by a feedforward multilayer network. Our architecture achieves 69.6% average accuracy on the PASCAL VOC 2012 test set.", "citation": "Citations (266)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mohammadreza Mostajabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mostajabi:Mohammadreza", "Payman Yadollahpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yadollahpour:Payman", "Gregory Shakhnarovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shakhnarovich:Gregory"], "pages": 10}
