The applicability and performance of GPU parallelizations is limited by the complexities of CPU-GPU communication. To address these communications problems, this paper presents the first fully automatic system for managing and optimizing CPU-GPU communcation. This system, called the CPU-GPU Communication Manager (CGCM), consists of a run-time library and a set of compiler transformations that work together to manage and optimize CPU-GPU communication without depending on the strength of static compile-time analyses or on programmer-supplied annotations. CGCM eases manual GPU parallelizations and improves the applicability and performance of automatic GPU parallelizations. For 24 programs, CGCM-enabled automatic GPU parallelization yields a whole program geomean speedup of 5.36x over the best sequential CPU-only execution.", "citation": "Citations (174)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Brown University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Thomas B.
