{"title": "HotFlex: Post-print Customization of 3D Prints Using Embedded State Change.", "fields": ["printed electronics", "3d modeling", "3d printing", "multimedia", "personalization"], "abstract": "While 3D printing offers great design flexibility before the object is printed, it is very hard for end-users to customize a 3D-printed object to their specific needs after it is printed. We propose HotFlex: a new approach allowing precisely located parts of a 3D object to transition on demand from a solid into a deformable state and back. This approach enables intuitive hands-on remodeling, personalization, and customization of a 3D object after it is printed. We introduce the approach and present an implementation based on computer-controlled printed heating elements that are embedded within the 3D object. We present a set of functional patterns that act as building blocks and enable various forms of hands-on customization. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to integrate sensing of user input and visual output. A series of technical experiments and various application examples demonstrate the practical feasibility of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Groeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Groeger:Daniel", "Elena Chong Loo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loo:Elena_Chong", "J\u00fcrgen Steimle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steimle:J=uuml=rgen"], "pages": 13}
