For this purpose, we exploit the connection between factor models and DAGs to propose Bayesian hierarchies based on spike and slab priors to promote sparsity, heavy-tailed priors to ensure identifiability and predictive densities to perform the model comparison. We require identifiability to be able to produce variable orderings leading to valid DAGs and sparsity to learn the structures. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on artificial and biological data showing that our approach outperform a number of state of the art methods.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ricardo Henao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henao:Ricardo", "Ole Winther.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winther:Ole"], "pages": 9}
