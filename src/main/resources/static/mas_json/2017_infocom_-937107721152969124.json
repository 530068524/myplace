A major question here is how to represent latency in desired objectives. Incorporation of multiple traffic characteristics (e.g., packet values and required processing requirements) significantly increases the complexity of buffer management policies. In this work, we consider weighted throughput optimization (total transmitted value) in the setting where every incoming packet is branded with intrinsic value, required processing, and slack (an offset from the arrival time when a packet should be transmitted), and the buffer is unbounded but effectively bounded by slacks. The main result is a 3-competitive algorithm as the slack-to-work ratio increases. Our results supported by a comprehensive evaluation study on CAIDA network traces.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Saint Petersburg Academic University", "IMDEA", "Steklov Institu ...
