{"title": "Audio Puzzler: piecing together time-stamped speech transcripts with a puzzle game.", "fields": ["ground truth", "multimedia", "casual", "computer science"], "abstract": "We have developed an audio-based casual puzzle game which produces a time-stamped transcription of spoken audio as a by-product of play. Our evaluation of the game indicates that it is both fun and challenging. The transcripts generated using the game are more accurate than those produced using a standard automatic transcription system and the time-stamps of words are within several hundred milliseconds of ground truth.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Nicholas Diakopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakopoulos:Nicholas", "Kurt Luther.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luther:Kurt", "Irfan A.
