Our method is based on a spectral decomposition, resulting in a closed-form efficient algorithm, in contrast to other iterative techniques that can be found in the literature. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art algorithms in significantly less time. We also demonstrate that our solution can efficiently handle datasets of hundreds of images, which is unprecedented in the literature.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Udine", "University of Udine", "University of Udine", "University of Udine", "University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Udine"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Eleonora Maset.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maset:Eleonora", "Federica Arrigoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arrigoni:Federica", "Andrea Fusiello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fusiello:Andrea"], "pages": 9}
