{"title": "'Don't Waste My Time': Use of Time Information Improves Focus.", "fields": ["social media", "software deployment", "task switching", "behavior change", "design elements and principles"], "abstract": "Maintaining work focus when on a computer is a major challenge, and people often feel that they use their time ineffectively. To improve focus we designed meTime, a real-time awareness application that shows users how they allocate their time across applications. In two real-world deployments involving 118 participants, we examined whether greater awareness of time use improves focus. In our first deployment, we provided awareness information using meTime, to both office workers and students. Exposure to meTime reduced use of social media, email, browsing and total time online. However increased awareness didn't affect time spent in productivity applications. A second educational deployment largely replicated these results and showed that meTime also reduced users' perceptions of their ability to focus effectively. Changed perceptions were associated with higher class grades. We discuss practical and theoretical implications as well as design principles for use of time applications.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Interactables, Santa Cruz, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Steve Whittaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittaker:Steve", "Vaiva Kalnikait\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalnikait=eacute=:Vaiva", "Victoria Hollis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hollis:Victoria", "Andrew Guydish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guydish:Andrew"], "pages": 10}
