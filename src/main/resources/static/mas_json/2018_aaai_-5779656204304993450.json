{"title": "Visual Explanation by High-Level Abduction: On Answer-Set Programming Driven Reasoning About Moving Objects.", "fields": ["belief revision", "abductive reasoning", "visual processing", "video tracking", "answer set programming"], "abstract": "We propose a hybrid architecture for systematically computing robust visual explanation(s) encompassing hypothesis formation, belief revision, and default reasoning with video data. The architecture consists of two tightly integrated synergistic components: (1) (functional) answer set programming based abductive reasoning with space-time tracklets as native entities; and (2) a visual processing pipeline for detection based object tracking and motion analysis. \nWe present the formal framework, its general implementation as a (declarative) method in answer set programming, and an example application and evaluation based on two diverse video datasets: the MOTChallenge benchmark developed by the vision community, and a recently developed Movie Dataset.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "University of Bremen"], "authors": ["Jakob Suchan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suchan:Jakob", "Mehul Bhatt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatt:Mehul", "Przemyslaw Andrzej Walega.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walega:Przemyslaw_Andrzej", "Carl P.
