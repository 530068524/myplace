{"title": "Approximating Graphic TSP by Matchings.", "fields": ["bounded function", "travelling salesman problem", "vertex", "claw free graph", "eulerian path"], "abstract": "We present a framework for approximating the metric TSP based on a novel use of matchings. Traditionally, matchings have been used to add edges in order to make a given graph Eulerian, whereas our approach also allows for the removal of certain edges leading to a decreased cost. For the TSP on graphic metrics (graph-TSP), the approach yields a 1.461-approximation algorithm with respect to the Held-Karp lower bound. For graph-TSP restricted to a class of graphs that contains degree three bounded and claw-free graphs, we show that the integrality gap of the Held-Karp relaxation matches the conjectured ratio 4/3. The framework allows for generalizations in a natural way and also leads to a 1.586-approximation algorithm for the traveling salesman path problem on graphic metrics where the start and end vertices are prespecified.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "KTH R.
