We formulate the optimal solution to this explore/exploit problem as a dynamic programming problem and show that efficiency is maximized by making a bid for each advertiser equal to the advertiser's expected value for the advertising opportunity plus a term proportional to the variance in this value divided by the number of impressions the advertiser has received thus far. We then use this result to illustrate that the value of incorporating active exploration into a machine learning system in an auction environment is exceedingly small.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Patrick Hummel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hummel:Patrick", "R.
