The ability to interact with the human's tactual modality introduces haptic human-machine interaction to replace or augment existing mediums such as visual and audible information. A distinct advantage of haptic human-machine interaction is the intrinsic bilateral nature, where information can be communicated in both directions simultaneously. This paper investigates the bilateral nature of the haptic interface in controlling the motion of a remote (or virtual) vehicle and presents the ability to provide an additional dimension of haptic information to the user over existing approaches (Park et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2002; and Horan et al., 2007). The 3D virtual haptic cone offers the ability to not only provide the user with relevant haptic augmentation pertaining to the task at hand, as do existing approaches, however, to also simultaneously provide an intuitive indication of the current velocities being commanded.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Deakin University", "Deakin University", "Deakin University", "Deakin University"], "authors": ["Ben Horan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horan:Ben", "Zoran Najdovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Najdovski:Zoran", "Saeid Nahavandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nahavandi:Saeid"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
