However, today's touch technologies, whose interactions are supported by graphics, sounds or crude clicks, have a tactile sameness and gaps in usability. We use a Large Area Tactile Pattern Display (LATPaD) to examine design possibilities and outcomes when touch interactions are enhanced with variable surface friction. In a series of four studies, we first confirm that variable friction gives significant performance advantages in low-level targeting activities. We then explore the design space of variable friction interface controls and assess user reactions. Most importantly, we demonstrate that variable friction can have a positive impact on the enjoyment, engagement and sense of realism experienced by users of touch interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of Canterbury", "Northwestern University", "UBC, Vancouver, ... olumbia, Canada", "UBC, Vancouver, ... olumbia, Canada"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Vincent L\u00e9vesque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=eacute=vesque:Vincent", "Louise Oram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oram:Louise", "Karon E.
