A multi-task Siamese neural network structure is formulated to connect embedding vectors and our objective to preserve the global node ranking and local proximity of nodes. We provide deeper analysis to connect the proposed proximity objective to link prediction and community detection in the network. We show our model can satisfy the following design properties: scalability, asymmetry, unity and simplicity. Experiment results not only verify the above design properties but also demonstrate the superior performance in learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan University", "Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yi-An Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Yi=An", "Chin-Chi Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Chin=Chi", "Wen-Hao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wen=Hao", "Mi-Yen Yeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeh:Mi=Yen", "Shou-De Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shou=De"], "pages": 10}
