{"title": "Model checking lots of systems: efficient verification of temporal properties in software product lines.", "fields": ["runtime verification", "model checking", "software product line", "critical system", "domain engineering"], "abstract": "In product line engineering, systems are developed in  families  and differences between family members are expressed in terms of  features . Formal modelling and verification is an important issue in this context as more and more critical systems are developed this way. Since the number of systems in a family can be exponential in the number of features, two major challenges are the scalable modelling and the efficient verification of system behaviour. Currently, the few attempts to address them fail to recognise the importance of features as a unit of difference, or do not offer means for automated verification.   In this paper, we tackle those challenges at a fundamental level. We first extend transition systems with features in order to describe the combined behaviour of an entire system family. We then define and implement a model checking technique that allows to verify such transition systems against temporal properties. An empirical evaluation shows substantial gains over classical approaches.", "citation": "Citations (296)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles"], "authors": ["Andreas Classen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Classen:Andreas", "Patrick Heymans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heymans:Patrick", "Pierre-Yves Schobbens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schobbens:Pierre=Yves", "Axel Legay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Legay:Axel", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raskin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raskin:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
