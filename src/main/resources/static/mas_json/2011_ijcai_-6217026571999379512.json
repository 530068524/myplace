HDA* leverages the Zobrist function to almost uniformly distribute and schedule work among processors.\n\nThis paper evaluates the performance of HDA* in optimal sequence alignment. We observe that with a large number of CPU cores HDA* suffers from an increase of search overhead caused by reexpansions of states in the closed list due to nonuniform edge costs in this domain. We therefore present a new work distribution strategy limiting processors to distribute work, thus increasing the possibility of detecting such duplicate search effort. We evaluate the performance of this approach on a cluster of multi-core machines and show that the approach scales well up to 384 CPU cores.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yoshikazu Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Yoshikazu", "Akihiro Kishimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kishimoto:Akihiro", "Osamu Watanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watanabe_0001:Osamu"], "pages": 7}
