Without goal-directed sampling strategies, samples falling outside of the selection constraints lower estimation efficiency at best, and cause inaccurate estimates at worst. This problem appears in general probabilistic database systems, where query processing is tightly coupled with sampling. By committing to a set of samples before evaluating the query, the engine wastes effort on samples that will be discarded, query processing that may need to be repeated, or unnecessarily large numbers of samples.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Oliver Kennedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kennedy:Oliver", "Christoph Koch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koch_0001:Christoph"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
