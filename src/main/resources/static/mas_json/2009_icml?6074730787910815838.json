Transfer learning seeks to remove this restriction. In shallow transfer, test instances are from the same domain, but have a different distribution. In deep transfer, test instances are from a different domain entirely (i.e., described by different predicates). Humans routinely perform deep transfer, but few learning systems, if any, are capable of it. In this paper we propose an approach based on a form of second-order Markov logic. Our algorithm discovers structural regularities in the source domain in the form of Markov logic formulas with predicate variables, and instantiates these formulas with predicates from the target domain. Using this approach, we have successfully transferred learned knowledge among molecular biology, social network and Web domains. The discovered patterns include broadly useful properties of predicates, like symmetry and transitivity, and relations among predicates, such as various forms of homophily.", "citation": "Citations (146)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Jesse Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Jesse", "Pedro M.
