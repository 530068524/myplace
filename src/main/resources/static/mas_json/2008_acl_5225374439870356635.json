{"title": "An Unsupervised Approach to Biography Production Using Wikipedia.", "fields": ["sentence", "classifier", "sentence extraction", "biography", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "We describe an unsupervised approach to multi-document sentence-extraction based summarization for the task of producing biographies. We utilize Wikipedia to automatically construct a corpus of biographical sentences and TDT4 to construct a corpus of non-biographical sentences. We build a biographical-sentence classifier from these corpora and an SVM regression model for sentence ordering from the Wikipedia corpus. We evaluate our work on the DUC2004 evaluation data and with human judges. Overall, our system significantly outperforms all systems that participated in DUC2004, according to the ROUGE-L metric, and is preferred by human subjects.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Fadi Biadsy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biadsy:Fadi", "Julia Hirschberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirschberg:Julia", "Elena Filatova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filatova:Elena"], "pages": 9}
