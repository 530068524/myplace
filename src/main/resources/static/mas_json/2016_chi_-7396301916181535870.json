{"title": "A Market in Your Social Network: The Effects of Extrinsic Rewards on Friendsourcing and Relationships.", "fields": ["response rate", "intrinsic value", "human computer interaction", "social network", "social psychology"], "abstract": "Friendsourcing consists of broadcasting questions and help requests to friends on social networking sites. Despite its potential value, friendsourcing requests often fall on deaf ears. One way to improve response rates and motivate friends to undertake more effortful tasks may be to offer extrinsic rewards, such as money or a gift, for responding to friendsourcing requests. However, past research suggests that these extrinsic rewards can have unintended consequences, including undermining intrinsic motivations and undercutting the relationship between people. To explore the effects of extrinsic reward on friends' response rate and perceived relationship, we conducted an experiment on a new friendsourcing platform - Mobilyzr. Results indicate that large extrinsic rewards increase friends' response rates without reducing the relationship strength between friends. Additionally, the extrinsic rewards allow requesters to explain away the failure of friendsourcing requests and thus preserve their perceptions of relationship ties with friends.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Haiyi Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Haiyi", "Sauvik Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Sauvik", "Yiqun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yiqun", "Shuang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Shuang", "Aniket Kittur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kittur:Aniket", "Robert E.
