Many valuable links between video segments can be identified by content-based copy detection methods, where \"copies\" are transformed versions of original video sequences. To make this approach viable for large video databases, we put forward a new mining method relying on the definition of a compact keyframe-level descriptor and of a specific index structure. The performance obtained in detecting links between video segments is evaluated with the help of a ground truth and several illustrations are given. The scalability of the approach is then demonstrated for databases of up to 10,000 hours of video.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers", "Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers", "Institut Nation ... r-Marne, France"], "authors": ["S\u00e9bastien Poullot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poullot:S=eacute=bastien", "Michel Crucianu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crucianu:Michel", "Olivier Buisson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buisson:Olivier"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
