{"title": "Automatic Web Content Extraction by Combination of Learning and Grouping.", "fields": ["noisy data", "document object model", "web mining", "web content", "information extraction"], "abstract": "Web pages consist of not only actual content, but also other elements such as branding banners, navigational elements, advertisements, copyright etc. This noisy content is typically not related to the main subjects of the webpages. Identifying the part of actual content, or clipping web pages, has many applications, such as high quality web printing, e-reading on mobile devices and data mining. Although there are many existing methods attempting to address this task, most of them can either work only on certain types of Web pages, e.g. article pages, or has to develop different models for different websites. We formulate the actual content identifying problem as a DOM tree node selection problem. We develop multiple features by utilizing the DOM tree node properties to train a machine learning model. Then candidate nodes are selected based on the learning model. Based on the observation that the actual content is usually located in a spatially continuous block, we develop a grouping technology to further filter out noisy data and pick missing data for the candidate nodes. We conduct extensive experiments on a real dataset and demonstrate our solution has high quality outputs and outperforms several baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Shanchan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Shanchan", "Jerry Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jerry", "Jian Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Jian"], "conf": "www", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
