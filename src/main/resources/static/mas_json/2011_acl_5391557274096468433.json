{"title": "Ordering Prenominal Modifiers with a Reranking Approach.", "fields": ["statistics", "principle of maximum entropy", "machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "permutation"], "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel approach to the generation task of ordering prenominal modifiers. We take a maximum entropy reranking approach to the problem which admits arbitrary features on a permutation of modifiers, exploiting hundreds of thousands of features in total. We compare our error rates to the state-of-the-art and to a strong Google n-gram count baseline. We attain a maximum error reduction of 69.8% and average error reduction across all test sets of 59.1% compared to the state-of-the-art and a maximum error reduction of 68.4% and average error reduction across all test sets of 41.8% compared to our Google n-gram count baseline.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jenny Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jenny", "Aria Haghighi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haghighi:Aria"], "pages": 8}
