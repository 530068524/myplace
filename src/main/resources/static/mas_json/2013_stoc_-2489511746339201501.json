We show that for any large enough k there are k-CNF's which require resolution width (1-~O(k -1/4 ))n, regular resolution size 2 (1-~O(k -1/4 ))n , and general resolution size (3/2) (1-~O(k -1/4 ))n .", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Christopher Beck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beck:Christopher", "Russell Impagliazzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Impagliazzo:Russell"], "pages": 8}
