Let w( M ) denote the weight of a matching in G, and  M * a minimum-cost perfect matching in G. We call a perfect matching  M c-approximate , for  c  \u2265 1, if w( M ) \u2264  c  \u00b7 w( M *). We present three approximation algorithms for computing minimum-cost perfect matchings in G.   First, we consider the case when d(\u00b7,\u00b7) is a metric. For any  \u0394  > 0, we present an algorithm that, in  O ( n  2+ \u0394   log  n  log 2 (1/ \u0394 )) time, computes a  O (1/ \u0394   \u03b1  )-approximate matching of G, where  \u03b1  = log 3  2 \u2248 0.631. Next, we assume the existence of a dynamic data structure for answering approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) queries under d(\u00b7\u00b7). Given two parameters  e, d e ) is the query and update time of an ( e /2)-ANN data structure.   Finally, we present an algorithm that works even if d(\u00b7,\u00b7) is not a metric but admits an ANN data structure for d(\u00b7,\u00b7). In particular, we present an algorithm that computes, in  O ( e  ---1  n  3/2  \u03c4  ( n, e ) log 4 ( n / e ) log \u0394) time, a (1 +  e )-approximate matching of  A  and  B ; here \u0394 is the ratio of the largest to the smallest-cost edge in G, and  \u03c4  ( n, e ) is the query and update time of an ( e / c )-ANN data structure for some constant  c  > 1.   We show that our results lead to faster matching algorithms for many geometric settings.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Duke University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Pankaj K.
