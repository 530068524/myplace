In this work, we study the interface between these two distinct topics and obtain techniques to uncover hierarchical block structure in symmetric matrices \u2013 an important aspect in the success of many vision problems. Our new algorithm, the incremental multiresolution matrix factorization, uncovers such structure one feature at a time, and hence scales well to large matrices. We describe how this multiscale analysis goes much farther than what a direct global factorization of the data can identify. We evaluate the efficacy of the resulting factorizations for relative leveraging within regression tasks using medical imaging data. We also use the factorization on representations learned by popular deep networks, providing evidence of their ability to infer semantic relationships even when they are not explicitly trained to do so. We show that this algorithm can be used as an exploratory tool to improve the network architecture, and within numerous other settings in vision.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Chicago", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Vamsi K.
