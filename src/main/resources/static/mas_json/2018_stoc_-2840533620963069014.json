We give an explicit binary tree code with constant distance and alphabet size  poly (log n ), where  n  is the depth of the tree. This is the first improvement over a two-decade-old construction that has an exponentially larger alphabet of size  poly ( n ).    At the core of our construction is the first explicit tree code with constant rate and constant distance, though with non-constant arity - a result of independent interest. This construction adapts the polynomial interpolation framework to the online setting.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Gil Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Gil", "Bernhard Haeupler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haeupler:Bernhard", "Leonard J.
