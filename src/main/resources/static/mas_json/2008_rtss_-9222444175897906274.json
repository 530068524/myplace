{"title": "Response Time Upper Bounds for Fixed Priority Real-Time Systems.", "fields": ["scheduling", "response time", "time complexity", "jitter", "upper and lower bounds"], "abstract": "This paper derives closed form upper bounds on the response times of tasks in fixed priority real-time systems. These bounds are valid for tasks with arbitrary deadlines, release jitter, and blocking. Response time upper bounds are given for tasks that are scheduled pre-emptively, cooperatively with intervals where pre-emption is deferred, and non-preemptively. The set of upper bounds for n tasks can be computed in O(n) time, providing a linear-time sufficient schedulability test, applicable to complex commercial real-time systems.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of York", "University of York"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Robert I.
