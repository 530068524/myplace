The assumption precludes scenarios where indefinitely many variables are needed. It also induces unnecessary queries when many variables are redundant. Based on a classical learning algorithm for Boolean functions, we develop two learning algorithms to infer Boolean functions over enlarging sets of ordered variables. We evaluate their performance in the learning-based loop invariant generation framework.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Yu-Fang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu=Fang", "Bow-Yaw Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Bow=Yaw"], "pages": 16}
