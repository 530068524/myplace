{"title": "Requirements, architecture, and quality in a mission critical system: 12 lessons learned.", "fields": ["user story", "software deployment", "architecture", "mission critical", "system requirements specification"], "abstract": "Public tender processes typically start with a comprehensive specification phase, where representatives of the eventual owner of the system, usually together with a hired group of consultants, spend a considerable amount of time to determine the needs of the owner. For the company that implements the system, this setup introduces two major challenges: (1) the written down requirements can never truly describe to a person, at least to one external to the specification process, the true intent behind the requirement; (2) the vision of the future system, stemming from the original idea, will change during the specification process \u2013 over time simultaneously invalidating at least some of the requirements. This paper reflects the experiences encountered in a large-scale mission critical information system \u2013 ERICA, an information system for the emergency services in Finland \u2013 regarding design, implementation, and deployment. Based on the experiences we propose more dynamic ways of system specification, leading to simpler design, implementation, and deployment phases and finally to a better perceived quality.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tampere University of Technology", "Insta DefSec, Finland"], "authors": ["Aapo Koski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koski:Aapo", "Tommi Mikkonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mikkonen:Tommi"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
