It has recently been applied to solving inference tasks in probabilistic logic programming, where the goal is to compute the probability of given queries being true provided a set of mutually independent random variables, a model (a logic program) and some evidence. The core of solving this inference task involves translating the logic program to a propositional theory and using a model counter. In this paper, we show that for some problems that involve inductive definitions like reachability in a graph, the translation of logic programs to SAT can be expensive for the purpose of solving inference tasks. For such problems, direct implementation of stable model semantics allows for more efficient solving. We present two implementation techniques, based on unfounded set detection, that extend a propositional model counter to a stable model counter. Our experiments show that for particular problems, our approach can outperform a state-of-the-art probabilistic logic programming solver by several orders of magnitude in terms of running time and space requirements, and can solve instances of significantly larger sizes on which the current solver runs out of time or memory", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Rehan Abdul Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz:Rehan_Abdul", "Geoffrey Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Geoffrey", "Christian J.
