This paper proposes a tree kernel-based framework for event pronoun resolution. In particular, a new tree expansion scheme is introduced to automatically determine a proper parse tree structure for event pronoun resolution by considering various kinds of competitive information related with the anaphor and the antecedent candidate. Evaluation on the OntoNotes English corpus shows the appropriateness of the tree kernel-based framework and the effectiveness of competitive information for event pronoun resolution.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Soochow University", "Soochow University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Fang Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Fang", "Guodong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guodong"], "pages": 6}
