By performing convolution over a local neighborhood of a node of interest, we are able to stack multiple layers of convolution and learn effective latent representations that integrate information across the graph that represent the three dimensional structure of a protein of interest. An architecture that combines the learned features across pairs of proteins is then used to classify pairs of amino acid residues as part of an interface or not. In our experiments, several graph convolution operators yielded accuracy that is better than the state-of-the-art SVM method in this task.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Colorado State University", "Colorado State University", "Colorado State University", "Colorado State University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alex Fout.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fout:Alex", "Jonathon Byrd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Byrd:Jonathon", "Basir Shariat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shariat:Basir", "Asa Ben-Hur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Hur:Asa"], "pages": 10}
