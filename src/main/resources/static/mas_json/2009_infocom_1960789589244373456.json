{"title": "PEDS: A Parallel Error Detection Scheme for TCAM Devices.", "fields": ["network packet", "content addressable memory", "ternary operation", "correctness", "content addressable storage"], "abstract": "Ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) devices are increasingly used for performing high-speed packet classification. A TCAM consists of an associative memory that compares a search key in parallel against all entries. TCAMs may suffer from error events that cause ternary cells to change their value to any symbol in the ternary alphabet {\"0\",\"1\",\"*\"}. Due to their parallel access feature, standard error detection schemes are not directly applicable to TCAMs; an additional difficulty is posed by the special semantic of the \"*\" symbol. This paper introduces PEDS, a novel parallel error detection scheme that locates the erroneous entries in a TCAM device. PEDS is based on applying an error-detecting code to each TCAM entry and utilizing the parallel capabilities of the TCAM by simultaneously checking the correctness of multiple TCAM entries. A key feature of PEDS is that the number of TCAM lookup operations required to locate all errors depends on the number of symbols per entry in a manner that is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the number of TCAM entries. For large TCAM devices, a specific instance of PEDS requires only 200 lookups for 100-symbol entries, while a naive approach may need hundreds of thousands of lookups. PEDS allows flexible and dynamic selection of tradeoff points between robustness, space complexity, and number of lookups.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Interdiscipl.
