{"title": "Digital Footprints and Changing Networks During Online Identity Transitions.", "fields": ["forgetting", "online identity", "transgender", "digital artifact", "social media"], "abstract": "Digital artifacts on social media can challenge individuals during identity transitions, particularly those who prefer to delete, separate from, or hide data that are representative of a past identity. This work investigates concerns and practices reported by transgender people who transitioned while active on Facebook. We analyze open-ended survey responses from 283 participants, highlighting types of data considered problematic when separating oneself from a past identity, and challenges and strategies people engage in when managing personal data in a networked environment. We find that people shape their digital footprints in two ways: by editing the self-presentational data that is representative of a prior identity, and by managing the configuration of people who have access to that self-presentation. We outline the challenging interplay between shifting identities, social networks, and the data that suture them together. We apply these results to a discussion of the complexities of managing and forgetting the digital past.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Oliver L.
