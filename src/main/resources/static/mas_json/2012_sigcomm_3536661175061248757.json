{"title": "DeTail: reducing the flow completion time tail in datacenter networks.", "fields": ["network packet", "rendering", "exploit", "protocol stack", "web application"], "abstract": "Web applications have now become so sophisticated that rendering a typical page may require hundreds of intra-datacenter flows. At the same time, web sites must meet strict page creation deadlines of 200-300 ms  to satisfy user demands for interactivity. Long-tailed flow completion times make it challenging for web sites to meet these constraints. They are forced to choose between rendering a subset of the complex page, or delay its rendering, thus missing deadlines and sacrificing either quality or responsiveness. Either option leads to potential financial loss.   In this paper, we present a new cross-layer network stack aimed at reducing the long tail of flow completion times. The approach exploits cross-layer information to reduce packet drops, prioritize latency-sensitive flows, and evenly distribute network load, effectively reducing the long tail of flow completion times. We evaluate our approach through NS-3 based simulation and Click-based implementation demonstrating our ability to consistently reduce the tail across a wide range of workloads. We often achieve reductions of over 50% in 99.9  th   percentile flow completion times.", "citation": "Citations (303)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Facebook", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["David Zats.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zats:David", "Tathagata Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Tathagata", "Prashanth Mohan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohan:Prashanth", "Dhruba Borthakur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borthakur:Dhruba", "Randy H.
