This collection of features is necessary for mechanizing fundamental statistical techniques. We formalize the first probabilistic language that exhibits these features, and it serves as a foundational framework for extending the ideas to more general languages. Particularly novel are our type system for absolutely continuous (AC) distributions (those which permit PDFs) and our PDF calculation procedure, which calculates PDF s for a large class of AC distributions. Our formalization paves the way toward the rigorous encoding of powerful statistical reformulations.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "New York University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sooraj Bhat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhat:Sooraj", "Ashish Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Ashish", "Richard W.
