{"title": "A Protocol-Independent Approach for Analyzing the Optimal Operation Point of CSMA/CA Protocols.", "fields": ["distributed coordination function", "access control", "carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance", "queueing theory", "collision"], "abstract": "This paper presents a protocol-independent ap- proach to reveal a new insight into the performance of car- rier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocols: the family of CSMA/CA protocols, independent of implementation details, share the same optimal operation point where the maximum protocol capacity is achieved. The protocol- independent analysis is inspired by the concept of virtual time slot. At the timescale of virtual-slot, all the CSMA/CA protocols show the same behavior pattern and, therefore, a generic virtual- slot based S-G (VS S-G) analysis is developed to compute the optimal operation point. The accuracy of the VS S-G analysis is benchmarked against the precise protocol-specific analysis, in particular, for the 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) and the 802.15.4 contention access period (CAP). Furthermore, this paper discusses how to integrate the network-layer queueing analysis with the VS S-G analysis at the medium access control (MAC) layer to form a generic cross-layer framework for call- level network capacity analysis.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Yu Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Yu", "Xinhua Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Xinhua", "Weihua Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Weihua"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
