{"title": "Online Group Feature Selection from Feature Streams.", "fields": ["kanade lucas tomasi feature tracker", "feature learning", "minimum redundancy feature selection", "feature"], "abstract": "Standard feature selection algorithms deal with given candidate feature sets at the individual feature level. When features exhibit certain group structures, it is beneficial to conduct feature selection in a grouped manner. For high-dimensional features, it could be far more preferable to online generate and process features one at a time rather than wait for generating all features before learning begins. In this paper, we discuss a new and interesting problem of online group feature selection from feature streams at both the group and individual feature levels simultaneously from a feature stream. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Vermont", "University of Vermont", "TCL Corporation", "University of Massachusetts Boston"], "authors": ["Hai-Guang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hai=Guang", "Xindong Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xindong", "Zhao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhao", "Wei Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding_0003:Wei"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
