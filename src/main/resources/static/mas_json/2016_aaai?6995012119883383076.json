{"title": "ExTaSem! Extending, Taxonomizing and Semantifying Domain Terminologies.", "fields": ["graph", "exploit", "data mining", "semantic network", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We introduce EXTASEM!, a novel approach for the automatic learning of lexical taxonomies from domain terminologies. First, we exploit a very large semantic network to collect thousands of in-domain textual definitions. Second, we extract (hyponym, hypernym) pairs from each definition with a CRF-based algorithm trained on manually-validated data. Finally, we introduce a graph induction procedure which constructs a full-fledged taxonomy where each edge is weighted according to its domain pertinence. EXTASEM! achieves state-of-the-art results in the following taxonomy evaluation experiments: (1) Hypernym discovery, (2) Reconstructing gold standard taxonomies, and (3) Taxonomy quality according to structural measures. We release weighted taxonomies for six domains for the use and scrutiny of the community.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Pompeu Fabra University", "Pompeu Fabra University", "Pompeu Fabra University", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "authors": ["Luis Espinosa Anke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anke:Luis_Espinosa", "Horacio Saggion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saggion:Horacio", "Francesco Ronzano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ronzano:Francesco", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
