As the demand for sensing systems increases, a more effective mechanism is required to sense information about human life. In this paper, we present a systematic study on the feasibility and gaining properties of a crowdsensing system that primarily concerns sensing WiFi packets in the air. We propose that this method is effective for estimating urban mobility by using only a small number of participants. During a seven-week deployment, we collected smartphone sensor data, including approximately four million WiFi packets from more than 130,000 unique devices in a city. Our analysis of this dataset examines core issues in urban mobility monitoring, including feasibility, spatio-temporal coverage, scalability, and threats to privacy. Collectively, our findings provide valuable insights to guide the development of new mobile sensing systems for urban life monitoring.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Yonsei University", "Yonsei University", "Yonsei University", "Yonsei University", "Yonsei University"], "authors": ["Yohan Chon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chon:Yohan", "Suyeon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Suyeon", "Seungwoo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Seungwoo", "Dongwon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Dongwon", "Yungeun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Yungeun", "Hojung Cha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cha:Hojung"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
