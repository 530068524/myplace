{"title": "Pay-As-You-Go OWL Query Answering Using a Triple Store.", "fields": ["monad", "datalog", "rdf", "semantic reasoner", "description logic"], "abstract": "We present an enhanced hybrid approach to OWL query answering that combines an RDF triple-store with an OWL reasoner in order to provide scalable pay-as-you-go performance. The enhancements presented here include an extension to deal with arbitrary OWLontologies, and optimisations that significantly improve scalability. We have implemented these techniques in a prototype system, a preliminary evaluation of which has produced very encouraging results.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Yujiao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yujiao", "Yavor Nenov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nenov:Yavor", "Bernardo Cuenca Grau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grau:Bernardo_Cuenca", "Ian Horrocks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horrocks:Ian"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
