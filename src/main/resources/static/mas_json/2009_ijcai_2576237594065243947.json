While recent work has been done in finding single dimensional and multi dimensional motifs in time series, we address motifs in general case, where the elements of multi dimensional motifs have temporal, length, and frequency variations. The proposed method is validated by synthetic data, and empirical evaluation has been done on several wearable systems that are used by real subjects.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Alireza Vahdatpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vahdatpour:Alireza", "Navid Amini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amini:Navid", "Majid Sarrafzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarrafzadeh:Majid"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
