We compute exact gradients of cross-validation performance with respect to all hyperparameters by chaining derivatives backwards through the entire training procedure. These gradients allow us to optimize thousands of hyperparameters, including step-size and momentum schedules, weight initialization distributions, richly parameterized regularization schemes, and neural network architectures. We compute hyperparameter gradients by exactly reversing the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent with momentum.", "citation": "Citations (146)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Dougal Maclaurin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maclaurin:Dougal", "David K.
