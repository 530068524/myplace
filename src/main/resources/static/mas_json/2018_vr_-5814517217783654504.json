Inspired by such types of art, we created Fluid Sketching as a novel medium for creating 3D fluid artwork in immersive virtual environments. It allows artists to draw 3D fluid-like sketches and manipulate them via six degrees of freedom input devices. Different brush stroke settings are available, varying the characteristics of the fluid. Because of fluids' nature, the diffusion of the drawn fluid sketch is animated, and artists have control over altering the fluid properties and stopping the diffusion process whenever they are satisfied with the current result. Furthermore, they can shape the drawn sketch by directly interacting with it, either with their hand or by blowing into the fluid. We rely on particle advection via curl-noise as a fast procedural method for animating the fluid flow.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Sevinc Eroglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eroglu:Sevinc", "Sascha Gebhardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gebhardt:Sascha", "Patric Schmitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmitz:Patric", "Dominik Rausch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rausch:Dominik", "Torsten Wolfgang Kuhlen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhlen:Torsten_Wolfgang"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
