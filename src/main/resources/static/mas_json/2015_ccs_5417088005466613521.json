In this paper, we collect publicly available data of two representative web vulnerability discovery ecosystems (Wooyun and HackerOne) and study their characteristics, trajectory, and impact. We find that both ecosystems include large and continuously growing white hat communities which have provided significant contributions to organizations from a wide range of business sectors. We also analyze vulnerability trends, response and resolve behaviors, and reward structures of participating organizations. Our analysis based on the HackerOne dataset reveals that a considerable number of organizations exhibit decreasing trends for reported web vulnerabilities. We further conduct a regression study which shows that monetary incentives have a significantly positive correlation with the number of vulnerabilities reported. Finally, we make recommendations aimed at increasing participation by white hats and organizations in such ecosystems.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Mingyi Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Mingyi", "Jens Grossklags.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossklags:Jens", "Peng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Peng"], "pages": 13}
