To simplify the label fusion problem, most methods implicitly make a strong assumption that the segmentation errors produced by different atlases are uncorrelated. We show that violating this assumption significantly reduces the efficiency of multi-atlas segmentation. To address this problem, we propose a regression-based approach for label fusion. Our experiments on segmenting the hippocampus in magnetic resonance images (MRI) show significant improvement over previous label fusion techniques.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hongzhi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hongzhi", "Jung Wook Suh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suh:Jung_Wook", "Sandhitsu R.
