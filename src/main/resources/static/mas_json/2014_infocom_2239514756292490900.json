We optimize the two problems jointly to quantify how much energy can be saved further and propose a scheme called SpeedControl which jointly manages application scheduling, CPU speed control and wireless interface selection. The scheme is shown to be near-optimal in that it tends to minimize energy consumption for given delay constraints. This paper is the first to reveal energy-delay tradeoffs in a holistic view considering multiple wireless interfaces, DVFS and multitasking in smart- phone. We perform real measurements on WiFi/3G coverage and throughput, power consumption of CPU and WiFi/3G interfaces, and CPU workloads. Trace-driven simulations based on the measurements demonstrate that SpeedControl can save over 30% of battery by trading 10 min delay as compared to existing schemes when WiFi temporal coverage is 65%, moreover, the saving tendency increases as WiFi coverage increases.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Jeongho Kwak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwak:Jeongho", "Okyoung Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Okyoung", "Song Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Song", "Prasant Mohapatra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohapatra:Prasant"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
