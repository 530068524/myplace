Only the component of motion along the local image gradient is constrained. In an essential part of optical flow algorithms, information must be aggregated from nearby image locations in order to estimate all components of motion. This limitation of local evidence for estimating optical flow is called \u201cthe aperture problem\u201d.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tianfan Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Tianfan", "Hossein Mobahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mobahi:Hossein", "Fr\u00e9do Durand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durand:Fr=eacute=do", "William T.
