{"title": "Multi-cue pedestrian classification with partial occlusion handling.", "fields": ["data set", "contextual image classification", "occlusion", "classification of discontinuities", "intelligent decision support system"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel mixture-of-experts framework for pedestrian classification with partial occlusion handling. The framework involves a set of component-based expert classifiers trained on features derived from intensity, depth and motion. To handle partial occlusion, we compute expert weights that are related to the degree of visibility of the associated component. This degree of visibility is determined by examining occlusion boundaries, i.e. discontinuities in depth and motion. Occlusion-dependent component weights allow to focus the combined decision of the mixture-of-experts classifier on the unoccluded body parts. In experiments on extensive real-world data sets, with both partially occluded and non-occluded pedestrians, we obtain significant performance boosts over state-of-the-art approaches by up to a factor of four in reduction of false positives at constant detection rates. The dataset is made public for benchmarking purposes.", "citation": "Citations (232)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Daimler AG"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Markus Enzweiler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Enzweiler:Markus", "Angela Eigenstetter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eigenstetter:Angela", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt", "Dariu M.
