We present a statistically secure commitment protocol in the BQS-UC model that composes concurrently with other protocols and an (a-priori) polynomially-bounded number of instances of itself. Our protocol has an efficient simulator which is important if one wishes to compose our protocol with protocols that are only computationally secure. Combining our result with prior results, we get a statistically BQS-UC secure constant-round protocol for general two-party computation without the need for any setup assumption.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Saarland University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Dominique Unruh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unruh:Dominique"], "pages": 20}
