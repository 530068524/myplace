This tool demonstration shows the features of ldiff, an enhanced, language-independent line differencing tool. L-diff builds upon the Unix diff and overcomes its limitations in determining whether an artifact line has been changed or is the result of additions and removals, and in tracking artifact fragments that have been moved upward or downward within the file. The paper describes the tool and shows its capability of analyzing changes on different kinds of software artifacts, including use cases, code developed with different programming languages, and test cases.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["University of Sannio", "University of Sannio", "University of Sannio"], "authors": ["Gerardo Canfora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canfora:Gerardo", "Luigi Cerulo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cerulo:Luigi", "Massimiliano Di Penta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Penta:Massimiliano_Di"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
