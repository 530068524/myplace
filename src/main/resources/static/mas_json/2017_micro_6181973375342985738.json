{"title": "Taming the instruction bandwidth of quantum computers via hardware-managed error correction.", "fields": ["quantum capacity", "programmer", "quantum error correction", "qubit", "quantum information"], "abstract": "A quantum computer consists of quantum bits (qubits) and a control processor that acts as an interface between the programmer and the qubits. As qubits are very sensitive to noise, they rely on continuous error correction to maintain the correct state. Current proposals rely on software-managed error correction and require large instruction bandwidth, which must scale in proportion to the number of qubits. While such a design may be reasonable for small-scale quantum computers, we show that instruction bandwidth tends to become a critical bottleneck for scaling quantum computers.   In this paper, we show that 99.999% of the instructions in the instruction stream of a typical quantum workload stem from error correction. Using this observation, we propose  QuEST ( Q uantum  E rror-Correction  S ubs t rate) , an architecture that delegates the task of quantum error correction to the hardware. QuEST uses a dedicated programmable micro-coded engine to continuously replay the instruction stream associated with error correction. The instruction bandwidth requirement of QuEST scales in proportion to the number of active qubits (typically", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Stanford University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Swamit S.
