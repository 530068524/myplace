As a result, expensive power generation plants and equipment costing millions of dollars are sitting idle most of the time, which increases costs for everyone. We present randomized load control, a simple distributed approach for scheduling smart appliances. Randomized load control schedules the start time of appliances that are programmed to run within a specified time window, so that the aggregate load achieves a given ideal load. Our results show that we do achieve the given ideal load to a great extent. This is remarkable as the approach is completely distributed and preserves customer privacy as the scheduling happens within each house or building separately.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Menkes van den Briel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Briel:Menkes_van_den", "Paul Scott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scott:Paul", "Sylvie Thi\u00e9baux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thi=eacute=baux:Sylvie"], "pages": 8}
