{"title": "Tensor-rank and lower bounds for arithmetic formulas.", "fields": ["conjecture", "random variate", "log log plot", "algebra", "homogeneous polynomial", "existential quantification", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "binary logarithm", "tensor"], "abstract": "We show that any explicit example for a tensor A:[n] r  -> F with tensor-rank \u2265 n r \u22c5 (1- o(1)) , (where r \u2264 log n / log log n), implies an explicit super-polynomial lower bound for the size of general arithmetic formulas over F. This shows that strong enough lower bounds for the size of arithmetic formulas of depth 3 imply super-polynomial lower bounds for the size of general arithmetic formulas. One component of our proof is a new approach for homogenization and multilinearization of arithmetic formulas, that gives the following results: We show that for any n-variate homogenous polynomial f of degree r, if there exists a (fanin-2) formula of size s and depth d for f then there exists a homogenous formula of size O ( d+r+1/r \u22c5 s) for f. In particular, for any r \u2264 log n / log log n, r \u2264 log n, if there exists a polynomial size formula for f then there exists a polynomial size homogenous formula for f. This refutes a conjecture of Nisan and Wigderson [10] and shows that super-polynomial lower bounds for homogenous formulas for polynomials of small degree imply super-polynomial lower bounds for general formulas. We show that for any n-variate set-multilinear polynomial f of degree r, if there exists a (fanin-2) formula of size s and depth d for f then there exists a set-multilinear formula of size O ( (d+2) r  \u22c5 s ) for f. In particular, for any r \u2264 log n / log log n, if there exists a polynomial size formula for f then there exists a polynomial size set-multilinear formula for f. This shows that super-polynomial lower bounds for set-multilinear formulas for polynomials of small degree imply super-polynomial lower bounds for general formulas.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ran Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Ran"], "pages": 8}
