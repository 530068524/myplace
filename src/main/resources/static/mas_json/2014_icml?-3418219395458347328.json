{"title": "On the convergence of no-regret learning in selfish routing.", "fields": ["convergence", "nash equilibrium", "replicator equation", "regret", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We study the repeated, non-atomic routing game, in which selfish players make a sequence of routing decisions. We consider a model in which players use regret-minimizing algorithms as the learning mechanism, and study the resulting dynamics. We are concerned in particular with the convergence to the set of Nash equilibria of the routing game. No-regret learning algorithms are known to guarantee convergence of a subsequence of population strategies. We are concerned with convergence of the actual sequence. We show that convergence holds for a large class of online learning algorithms, inspired from the continuous-time replicator dynamics. In particular, the discounted Hedge algorithm is proved to belong to this class, which guarantees its convergence.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Walid Krichene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krichene:Walid", "Benjamin Drigh\u00e8s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drigh=egrave=s:Benjamin", "Alexandre M.
