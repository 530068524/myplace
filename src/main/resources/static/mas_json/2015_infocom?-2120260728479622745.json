{"title": "Human object estimation via backscattered radio frequency signal.", "fields": ["radio frequency", "computer hardware", "computer network", "telecommunications", "rss"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a system called R# to estimate the number of human objects using passive RFID tags but without attaching anything to human objects. The idea is based on our observation that the more human objects are present, the higher the variance in the RSS values of the tag backscattered RF signal. Thus, based on the received RF signal, the reader can estimate the number of human objects. R# includes an RFID reader and some (say 20) passive tags, which are deployed in the region that we want to monitor the number of human objects, such as the region in front of a painting. The RFID reader periodically emits RF signal to identify all tags and the tags simply respond with their IDs via C1G2 standard protocols. We implemented R# using commercial Impinj H47 passive RFID tags and Impinj reader model R420. We conducted experiments in a simulated picking aisle area of the supermarket environment. The experimental results show that R# can achieve high estimation accuracy (more than 90%).", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Michigan State University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "University of Science and Technology, Sana'a"], "authors": ["Han Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Han", "Jinsong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jinsong", "Alex X.
