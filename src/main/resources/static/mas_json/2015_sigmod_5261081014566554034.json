{"title": "ByteSlice: Pushing the Envelop of Main Memory Data Processing with a New Storage Layout.", "fields": ["bit array", "performance improvement", "online analytical processing", "computer memory", "simd"], "abstract": "Scan and lookup are two core operations in main memory column stores. A scan operation scans a column and returns a result bit vector that indicates which records satisfy a filter. Once a column scan is completed, the result bit vector is converted into a list of record numbers, which is then used to look up values from other columns of interest for a query. Recently there are several in-memory data layout proposals that aim to improve the performance of in-memory data processing. However, these solutions all stand at either end of a trade-off --- each is either good in lookup performance or good in scan performance, but not both. In this paper we present ByteSlice, a new main memory storage layout that supports both highly efficient scans and lookups. ByteSlice is a byte-level columnar layout that fully leverages SIMD data-parallelism. Micro-benchmark experiments show that ByteSlice achieves a data scan speed at less than 0.5 processor cycle per column value --- a new limit of main memory data scan, without sacrificing lookup performance. Our experiments on TPC-H data and real data show that ByteSlice offers significant performance improvement over all state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "University of Hong Kong", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ziqiang Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Ziqiang", "Eric Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo:Eric", "Ben Kao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kao:Ben", "Wenjian Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Wenjian"], "pages": 16}
