{"title": "Structure-Blind Signal Recovery.", "fields": ["oracle", "regular polygon", "minimax", "estimator", "minimax estimator"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of recovering a signal observed in Gaussian noise. If the set of signals is convex and compact, and can be specified beforehand, one can use classical linear estimators that achieve a risk within a constant factor of the minimax risk. However, when the set is unspecified, designing an estimator that is blind to the hidden structure of the signal remains a challenging problem. We propose a new family of estimators to recover signals observed in Gaussian noise. Instead of specifying the set where the signal lives, we assume the existence of a well-performing linear estimator. Proposed estimators enjoy exact oracle inequalities and can be efficiently computed through convex optimization. We present several numerical illustrations that show the potential of the approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Dmitry Ostrovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrovsky:Dmitry", "Za\u00efd Harchaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harchaoui:Za=iuml=d", "Anatoli Juditsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juditsky:Anatoli", "Arkadi Nemirovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nemirovski:Arkadi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
