Under this new information representation, computations can be performed by observing the relative propagation times of signals injected into the circuit (i.e. the outcome of races). Race Logic is especially suited for solving problems related to the", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Advait Madhavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madhavan:Advait", "Timothy Sherwood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sherwood:Timothy", "Dmitri B.
