{"title": "Vivisecting YouTube: An active measurement study.", "fields": ["distributed cache", "unicast", "cache", "file server", "video server"], "abstract": "We deduce key design features behind the YouTube video delivery system by building a distributed active measurement infrastructure, and collecting and analyzing a large volume of video playback logs, DNS mappings and latency data. We find that the design of YouTube video delivery system consists of three major components: a \u201cflat\u201d video id space, multiple DNS namespaces reflecting a multi-layered logical organization of video servers, and a 3-tier physical cache hierarchy. We also uncover that YouTube employs a set of sophisticated mechanisms to handle video delivery dynamics such as cache misses and load sharing among its distributed cache locations and data centers.", "citation": "Citations (218)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Vijay Kumar Adhikari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adhikari:Vijay_Kumar", "Sourabh Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Sourabh", "Yingying Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0002:Yingying", "Zhi-Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhi=Li"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
