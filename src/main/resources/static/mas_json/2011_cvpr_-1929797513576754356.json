A global alignment graph structure is introduced which uses shape similarity to identify frames for inter-sequence registration. Graph optimisation is performed to minimise the total non-rigid deformation required to register the input sequences into a common structure. The resulting global alignment ensures that all input sequences are resampled with a common mesh structure which preserves the shape and temporal correspondence. Results demonstrate temporally consistent representation of several public databases of mesh sequences for multiple people performing a variety of motions with loose clothing and hair.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "University of Surrey"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Peng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Peng", "Chris Budd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Budd:Chris", "Adrian Hilton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hilton:Adrian"], "pages": 8}
