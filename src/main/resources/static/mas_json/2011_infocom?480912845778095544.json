Due to the highly dynamic driving patterns of vehicles, it has been a challenging research problem to achieve effective and time-sensitive data forwarding in vehicular networks. In this paper, a Shared-Trajectory-based Data Forwarding Scheme (STDFS) is proposed, which utilizes shared vehicle trajectory information to address this problem. With access points sparsely deployed to disseminate vehicles' trajectory information, the encounters between vehicles can be predicted by the vehicle that has data to send, and an encounter graph is then constructed to aid packet forwarding. This paper focuses on the specific issues of STDFS such as encounter prediction, encounter graph construction, forwarding sequence optimization and the data forwarding process. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "University of Tennessee"], "authors": ["Fulong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Fulong", "Shuo Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Shuo", "Jaehoon Jeong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeong:Jaehoon", "Yu Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu_0001:Yu", "Qing Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Qing", "Ming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Ming", "Tian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Tian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
