{"title": "Structural Topic Model for Latent Topical Structure Analysis.", "fields": ["text mining", "annotation", "markov chain", "topic model", "sentence"], "abstract": "Topic models have been successfully applied to many document analysis tasks to discover topics embedded in text. However, existing topic models generally cannot capture the latent topical structures in documents. Since languages are intrinsically cohesive and coherent, modeling and discovering latent topical transition structures within documents would be beneficial for many text analysis tasks.\n\nIn this work, we propose a new topic model, Structural Topic Model, which simultaneously discovers topics and reveals the latent topical structures in text through explicitly modeling topical transitions with a latent first-order Markov chain. Experiment results show that the proposed Structural Topic Model can effectively discover topical structures in text, and the identified structures significantly improve the performance of tasks such as sentence annotation and sentence ordering.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hongning Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hongning", "Duo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Duo", "ChengXiang Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:ChengXiang"], "pages": 10}
