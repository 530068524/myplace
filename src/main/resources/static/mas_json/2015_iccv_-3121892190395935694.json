{"title": "Hierarchical Higher-Order Regression Forest Fields: An Application to 3D Indoor Scene Labelling.", "fields": ["pairwise comparison", "potts model", "associative property", "structured prediction", "conditional random field"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of semantic segmentation of 3D indoor scenes reconstructed from RGB-D images. Traditionally label prediction for 3D points is tackled by employing graphical models that capture scene features and complex relations between different class labels. However, the existing work is restricted to pairwise conditional random fields, which are insufficient when encoding rich scene context. In this work we propose models with higher-order potentials to describe complex relational information from the 3D scenes. Specifically, we relax the labelling problem to a regression, and generalize the higher-order associative P n Potts model to a new family of arbitrary higher-order models based on regression forests. We show that these models, like the robust P n models, can still be decomposed into the sum of pairwise terms by introducing auxiliary variables. Moreover, our proposed higher-order models also permit extension to hierarchical random fields, which allows for the integration of scene context and features computed at different scales. Our potential functions are constructed based on regression forests encoding Gaussian densities that admit efficient inference. The parameters of our model are learned from training data using a structured learning approach. Results on two datasets show clear improvements over current state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "Australian National University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Trung-Thanh Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Trung=Thanh", "Ian D.
