To this end, we apply the modulus of smoothness. With the help of the new oracle inequality we then derive learning rates that can also be achieved by a simple data-dependent parameter selection method. Finally, it turns out that our learning rates are asymptotically optimal for regression functions satisfying certain standard smoothness conditions.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "authors": ["Mona Eberts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eberts:Mona", "Ingo Steinwart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinwart:Ingo"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
