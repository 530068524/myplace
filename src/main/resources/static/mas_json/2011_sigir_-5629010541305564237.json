For large-scale web search engines, this translates into high energy consumption and a huge electric bill. This work takes the challenge to reduce the electric bill of commercial web search engines operating on data centers that are geographically far apart. Based on the observation that energy prices and query workloads show high spatio-temporal variation, we propose a technique that dynamically shifts the query workload of a search engine between its data centers to reduce the electric bill. Experiments on real-life query workloads obtained from a commercial search engine show that significant financial savings can be achieved by this technique.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Bilkent University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Bilkent University"], "authors": ["Enver Kayaaslan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kayaaslan:Enver", "Berkant Barla Cambazoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cambazoglu:Berkant_Barla", "Roi Blanco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanco:Roi", "Flavio Paiva Junqueira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Junqueira:Flavio_Paiva", "Cevdet Aykanat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aykanat:Cevdet"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
