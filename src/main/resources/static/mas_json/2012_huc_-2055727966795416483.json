It presents many challenges,  e.g ., efficient capture of person's mobility, understanding of context changes and preservation of user privacy. We propose an accurate and energy-efficient method able to capture user's mobility, thus the context changes, while preserving his/her privacy. Our solution can be applied to systems that aim to efficiently sense context on smartphones to study large scale phenomena or perform location management.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Geneva", "University of Geneva"], "authors": ["Mattia Gustarini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gustarini:Mattia", "Katarzyna Wac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wac:Katarzyna"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
