{"title": "Learning to Become an Expert: Deep Networks Applied to Super-Resolution Microscopy.", "fields": ["super resolution microscopy", "machine learning", "sted microscopy", "optical microscope", "artificial neural network"], "abstract": "With super-resolution optical microscopy, it is now possible to observe molecular interactions in living cells. The obtained images have a very high spatial precision but their overall quality can vary a lot depending on the structure of interest and the imaging parameters. Moreover, evaluating this quality is often difficult for non-expert users. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning the quality function of super- resolution images from scores provided by experts. More specifically, we are proposing a system based on a deep neural network that can provide a quantitative quality measure of a STED image of neuronal structures given as input. We conduct a user study in order to evaluate the quality of the predictions of the neural network against those of a human expert. Results show the potential while highlighting some of the limits of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Laval University", "Laval University", "Laval University", "Laval University"], "authors": ["Louis-\u00c9mile Robitaille.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robitaille:Louis==Eacute=mile", "Audrey Durand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durand:Audrey", "Marc-Andr\u00e9 Gardner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gardner:Marc=Andr=eacute=", "Christian Gagn\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gagn=eacute=:Christian", "Paul De Koninck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koninck:Paul_De", "Flavie Lavoie-Cardinal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lavoie=Cardinal:Flavie"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
