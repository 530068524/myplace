{"title": "RADAR: Runtime-assisted dead region management for last-level caches.", "fields": ["runtime system", "cache", "radar", "programming paradigm", "granularity"], "abstract": "Last-level caches (LLCs) bridge the processor/memory speed gap and reduce energy consumed per access. Unfortunately, LLCs are poorly utilized because of the relatively large occurrence of dead blocks. We propose RADAR, a hybrid static/dynamic dead-block management technique that can accurately predict and evict dead blocks in LLCs. RADAR does dead-block prediction and eviction at the granularity of address regions supported in many of today's task-parallel programming models. The runtime system utilizes static control-flow information about future region accesses in conjunction with past region access patterns to make accurate predictions about dead regions. The runtime system instructs the cache to demote and eventually evict blocks belonging to such dead regions. This paper considers three RADAR schemes to predict dead regions: a scheme that uses control-flow information provided by the programming model (Look-ahead), a history-based scheme (Look-back) and a combined scheme (Look-ahead and Look-back). Our evaluation shows that, on average, all RADAR schemes outperform state-of-the-art hardware dead-block prediction techniques, whereas the combined scheme always performs best.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Chalmers University of Technology", "Chalmers University of Technology", "Chalmers University of Technology", "Chalmers University of Technology"], "authors": ["Madhavan Manivannan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manivannan:Madhavan", "Vassilis Papaefstathiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papaefstathiou:Vassilis", "Miquel Peric\u00e0s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peric=agrave=s:Miquel", "Per Stenstr\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stenstr=ouml=m:Per"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
