We explored the use of asynchronous video in temporally distributed teams. We developed VideoThreads, which provides a novel thread-based visualization of video messages. Based on a deployment to four teams, we offer design recommendations and insights about the benefits of asynchronous video sharing.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jeremy T.
