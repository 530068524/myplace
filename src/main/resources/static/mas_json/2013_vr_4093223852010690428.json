However, Random Waypoint model and its variants fail to satisfactorily depict mobile users' movement patterns with fidelity. Two features of a game engine, namely character AI and pathfinding can be utilized to enhance mobility modeling in network simulations. This demo builds a virtual scene of typical office environment with multiple employees. Movements of the virtual characters are firstly generated and visualized using Random Waypoint model, and then using alternative approaches combining AI-based control with pathfinding. Through comparison it can be clearly observed that the latter improves simulation fidelity significantly.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Qualcomm"], "authors": ["Xun Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Xun"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
