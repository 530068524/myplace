We collect and analyze HDFS traces to identify potential improvements, which we then evaluate via simulation. Messages represents a new HDFS workload: whereas HDFS was built to store very large files and receive mostly-sequential I/O, 90% of files are smaller than 15MB and I/O is highly random. We find hot data is too large to easily fit in RAM and cold data is too large to easily fit in flash; however, cost simulations show that adding a small flash tier improves performance more than equivalent spending on RAM or disks. HBase's layered design offers simplicity, but at the cost of performance; our simulations show that network I/O can be halved if compaction bypasses the replication layer. Finally, although Messages is read-dominated, several features of the stack (i.e., logging, compaction, replication, and caching) amplify write I/O, causing writes to dominate disk I/O.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "authors": ["Tyler Harter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harter:Tyler", "Dhruba Borthakur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borthakur:Dhruba", "Siying Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Siying", "Amitanand S.
