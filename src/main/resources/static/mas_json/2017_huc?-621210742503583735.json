{"title": "ARTopos: augmented reality terrain map visualization for collaborative route planning.", "fields": ["climbing", "terrain", "backup", "topographic map", "cycling"], "abstract": "Most outdoor activities, such as alpine climbing, cycling, or hiking, require a careful route planning in advance. Today, most routing applications are single-user desktop applications. Furthermore, it is good practice to be able to do paper map based navigation during the trip as a backup. In this work, we propose ARTopos, a concept and implementation of a augmented reality (AR) 3D topographic map visualization, which combines analog paper map planning and digital routing service. It augments paper topographic maps with a digital terrain map suitable for interaction and displaying forecast information. We implemented a first prototype for which we gathered generally positive qualitative feedback as a first initial evaluation. We envision ARTopos as an interactive, collaborative tool can be used during the preliminary trip briefing for most adventurous activities.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"], "authors": ["Frederik Wiehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiehr:Frederik", "Florian Daiber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daiber:Florian", "Felix Kosmalla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosmalla:Felix", "Antonio Kr\u00fcger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=ger:Antonio"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
