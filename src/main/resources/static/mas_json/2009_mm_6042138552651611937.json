However, the requirements of huge network bandwidth and computing resources make it still a big challenge to render 3D video on mobile devices at real-time. In this paper, we present how remote rendering framework can be used to solve the problem. The differences between dynamic 3D video and static graphic models are analyzed. A general proxy-based framework is presented to render 3D video streams on the proxy and transmit the rendered scene to mobile devices over a wireless network. An image-based approach is proposed to enhance 3D interactivity and reduce the interaction delay. Experiments prove that the remote rendering framework can be effectively used for quality 3D video rendering on mobile devices in real time.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Shu Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Shu", "Won J.
