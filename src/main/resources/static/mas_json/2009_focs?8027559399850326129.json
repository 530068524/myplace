These are the first non-trivial lower bounds for general NOF multiparty communication complexity for any AC^0 function for omega(log log n) players. For non-constant k the bounds are larger than all previous lower bounds for any AC^0 function even for simultaneous communication complexity. Our lower bounds imply the first super polynomial lower bounds for the simulation of AC^0 by MAJ-SYMM-AND circuits, showing that the well-known quasipolynomial simulations of AC^0 by such circuits are qualitatively optimal, even for formulas of small constant depth. We also exhibit a depth 5 formula in NPc-BPPc for up to Theta(log n) players and derive an Omega(2^{sqrt{log n}/sqrt{k}}) lower bound on the randomized k-party NOF communication complexity of set disjointness for up to Theta(log^{1/3} n) players which is significantly larger than the O(log log n) players allowed in the best previous lower bounds for multiparty set disjointness. We prove other strong results for depth 3 and 4 AC^0 functions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Paul Beame.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beame:Paul", "Dang-Trinh Huynh-Ngoc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huynh=Ngoc:Dang=Trinh"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
