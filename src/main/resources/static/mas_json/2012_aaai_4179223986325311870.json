In this work, we propose a plausible grounded cognitive model for artificial metaphor acquisition. We put forward a rule-based metaphor acquisition system, which doesn't make use of any prior 'seed metaphor set'. Through correlation between a video and co-occurring commentaries, we show that these rules can be acquired in an unsupervised manner by an early learner capable of abstracting from multi-modal sensory input. From these grounded linguistic concepts, we derive classes based on lexico-syntactical language properties. Based on the selectional preferences of these linguistic elements, metaphorical mappings between source and target domains are acquired.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur"], "authors": ["Sushobhan Nayak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nayak:Sushobhan", "Amitabha Mukerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukerjee:Amitabha"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
