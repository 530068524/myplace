{"title": "Learning Sub-Word Units for Open Vocabulary Speech Recognition.", "fields": ["hybrid word", "lexicon", "constant false alarm rate", "heuristic", "phone"], "abstract": "Large vocabulary speech recognition systems fail to recognize words beyond their vocabulary, many of which are information rich terms, like named entities or foreign words. Hybrid word/sub-word systems solve this problem by adding sub-word units to large vocabulary word based systems; new words can then be represented by combinations of sub-word units. Previous work heuristically created the sub-word lexicon from phonetic representations of text using simple statistics to select common phone sequences. We propose a probabilistic model to learn the subword lexicon optimized for a given task. We consider the task of out of vocabulary (OOV) word detection, which relies on output from a hybrid model. A hybrid model with our learned sub-word lexicon reduces error by 6.3% and 7.6% (absolute) at a 5% false alarm rate on an English Broadcast News and MIT Lectures task respectively.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "IBM", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Carolina Parada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parada:Carolina", "Mark Dredze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dredze:Mark", "Abhinav Sethy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sethy:Abhinav", "Ariya Rastrow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rastrow:Ariya"], "pages": 10}
