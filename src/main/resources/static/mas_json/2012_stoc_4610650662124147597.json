{"title": "Many sparse cuts via higher eigenvalues.", "fields": ["bounded function", "conductance", "laplace operator", "disjoint sets", "integer"], "abstract": "Cheeger's fundamental inequality states that any edge-weighted graph has a vertex subset S such that its expansion (a.k.a. conductance) is bounded as follows: [ \u03c6(S) def= (w(S,bar{S}))/(min set(w(S), w(bar(S)))) \u2264 \u221a(2 \u03bb 2 ) ] where w is the total edge weight of a subset or a cut and \u03bb 2  is the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian of the graph. Here we prove the following natural generalization: for any integer k \u2208 [n], there exist ck disjoint subsets S 1 , ..., S ck , such that [ max i  \u03c6(S i ) \u2264 C \u221a(\u03bb k  log k) ] where \u03bb k  is the kth smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian and c 0 are suitable absolute constants. Our proof is via a polynomial-time algorithm to find such subsets, consisting of a spectral projection and a randomized rounding. As a consequence, we get the same upper bound for the small set expansion problem, namely for any k, there is a subset S whose weight is at most a O(1/k) fraction of the total weight and \u03c6(S) \u2264 C \u221a(\u03bb k  log k). Both results are the best possible up to constant factors.   The underlying algorithmic problem, namely finding k subsets such that the maximum expansion is minimized, besides extending sparse cuts to more than one subset, appears to be a natural clustering problem in its own right.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anand Louis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Louis:Anand", "Prasad Raghavendra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavendra:Prasad", "Prasad Tetali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tetali:Prasad", "Santosh Vempala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vempala:Santosh"], "pages": 10}
