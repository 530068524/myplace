Without effective extraction of real-world trajectory, the tactic of soccer cannot be properly represented and analyzed from the perspective of soccer professionals. In this paper, a real-world trajectory extraction method is proposed. Moreover, six attack patterns are defined to represent tactic of soccer, and a novel attack pattern recognition algorithm is developed based on the analysis of the ball's state and real-world trajectory. To our best knowledge, this is the first work of its kind that systematically analyzes tactic of soccer based on real-world trajectory for broadcast soccer video. Our experiments demonstrate that the defined attack pattern can be effectively recognized.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Xidian University", "University of Texas at San Antonio", "Xidian University"], "authors": ["Zhenxing Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Zhenxing", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi", "Xinbo Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Xinbo"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
