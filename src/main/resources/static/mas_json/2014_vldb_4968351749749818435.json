However, we hypothesize that the performance benefits amount to implementation details, not a fundamental limitation of the relational model. To evaluate this hypothesis, we are exploring code-generation to produce fast in-memory algorithms and data structures for graph patterns that are inaccessible to conventional relational optimizers.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Brandon Myers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Myers:Brandon", "Jeremy Hyrkas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hyrkas:Jeremy", "Daniel Halperin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halperin:Daniel", "Bill Howe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Howe:Bill"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2014", "pages": 16}
