However, advanced tooling is hampered by the dynamic nature of the language, which makes any form of static analysis very difficult. We single out efficient call graph construction as a key problem to be solved in order to improve development tools for JavaScript. To address this problem, we present a scalable field-based flow analysis for constructing call graphs. Our evaluation on large real-world programs shows that the analysis, while in principle unsound, produces highly accurate call graphs in practice. Previous analyses do not scale to these programs, but our analysis handles them in a matter of seconds, thus proving its suitability for use in an interactive setting.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Nanyang Technological University", "IBM", "IBM", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Asger Feldthaus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldthaus:Asger", "Max Sch\u00e4fer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=auml=fer:Max", "Manu Sridharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sridharan:Manu", "Julian Dolby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dolby:Julian", "Frank Tip.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tip:Frank"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
