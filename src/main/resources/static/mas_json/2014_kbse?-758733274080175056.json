We propose five novel parallel algorithms for solving MOCO problems exactly and efficiently. Our algorithms rely on off-the-shelf solvers to search for exact Pareto-optimal solutions, and they parallelize the search via collaborative communication, divide-and-conquer, or both. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our algorithms by experiments on three case studies of software-system designs. A key finding is that one algorithm, which we call FS-GIA, achieves substantial (even super-linear) speedups that scale well up to 64 cores. Furthermore, we analyze the performance bottlenecks and opportunities of our parallel algorithms, which facilitates further research on exact, parallel MOCO.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Jianmei Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jianmei", "Edward Zulkoski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zulkoski:Edward", "Rafael Olaechea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olaechea:Rafael", "Derek Rayside.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rayside:Derek", "Krzysztof Czarnecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czarnecki:Krzysztof", "Sven Apel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apel:Sven", "Joanne M.
