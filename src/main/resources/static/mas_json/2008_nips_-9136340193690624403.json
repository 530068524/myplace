While likelihood-based methods have been extensively explored, to our knowledge, learning structured prediction models with latent variables based on the max-margin principle remains largely an open problem. In this paper, we present a partially observed Maximum Entropy Discrimination Markov Network (PoMEN) model that attempts to combine the advantages of Bayesian and margin based paradigms for learning Markov networks from partially labeled data. PoMEN leads to an averaging prediction rule that resembles a Bayes predictor that is more robust to overfitting, but is also built on the desirable discriminative laws resemble those of the M3N. We develop an EM-style algorithm utilizing existing convex optimization algorithms for M3N as a subroutine. We demonstrate competent performance of PoMEN over existing methods on a real-world web data extraction task.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Eric P.
