{"title": "Learning Hierarchical Riffle Independent Groupings from Rankings.", "fields": ["standard 52 card deck", "riffle", "interleaving", "disjoint sets", "shuffling"], "abstract": "Riffled independence is a generalized notion of probabilistic independence that has been shown to be naturally applicable to ranked data. In the riffled independence model, one assigns rankings to two disjoint sets of items independently, then in a second stage, interleaves (or riffles) the two rankings together to form a full ranking, as if by shuffling a deck of cards. Because of this interleaving stage, it is much more difficult to detect riffled independence than ordinary independence. In this paper, we provide the first automated method for discovering sets of items which are riffle independent from a training set of rankings. We show that our clustering-like algorithms can be used to discover meaningful latent coalitions from real preference ranking datasets and to learn the structure of hierarchically decomposable models based on riffled independence.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Jonathan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jonathan", "Carlos Guestrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guestrin:Carlos"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
