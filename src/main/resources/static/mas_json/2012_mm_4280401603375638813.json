{"title": "UltraGrid: low-latency high-quality video transmissions on commodity hardware.", "fields": ["uncompressed video", "ranging", "video compression picture types", "video processing", "low latency"], "abstract": "This paper gives a brief overview of UltraGrid---a high-quality video transmission software. Employing a commodity PC and Mac hardware, UltraGrid allows for transmission of video in resolutions ranging through HD up to 2160p/4K with end-to-end latency as low as 75ms. The high-quality is achieved either by transmitting uncompressed video streams or streams with low compression ratio. UltraGrid was originally developed as a research tool to demonstrate capabilities of 10Gbps networks and to study multi-point data distribution in high-speed network environments. Through years it has evolved into an open-source project intended to support applications having quality demands beyond the competence of standard videoconferencing or streaming tools. Nowadays, the main application areas are collaborative environments, medical, cinematography and broadcasting applications, as well as various educational activities.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["CESNET", "CESNET", "CESNET", "CESNET"], "authors": ["Petr Holub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holub:Petr", "Jiri Matela.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matela:Jiri", "Martin Pulec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pulec:Martin", "Martin Srom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srom:Martin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
