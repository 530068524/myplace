We prove that the Price of Stability of such games is constant, thus closing a long-standing open problem raised in  Anshelevich et al. (2008) . Our result is obtained by means of homogenization, a new technique that, in any intermediate state locally diverging from a given optimal solution      T    \u204e     , is able to restore local similarity by exploiting cost differences between nearby players in      T    \u204e     .", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Salento", "University of L'Aquila", "University of Chieti-Pescara", "University of Salento", "University of L'Aquila", "University of Chieti-Pescara"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Vittorio Bil\u00f2.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bil=ograve=:Vittorio", "Michele Flammini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flammini:Michele", "Luca Moscardelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moscardelli:Luca"], "pages": 10}
