It exhibits a worst-to-average-case reduction making the LWE assumption very plausible. This worst-to-average-case reduction is based on a Fourier argument and the errors for current applications of LWE must be chosen from a gaussian distribution. However, sampling from gaussian distributions is cumbersome.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Nico D\u00f6ttling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=ouml=ttling:Nico", "J\u00f6rn M\u00fcller-Quade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller=Quade:J=ouml=rn"], "pages": 17}
