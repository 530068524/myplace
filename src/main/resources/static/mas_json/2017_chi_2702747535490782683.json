{"title": "Response Times when Interpreting Artificial Subtle Expressions are Shorter than with Human-like Speech Sounds.", "fields": ["confidence interval", "response time", "expression", "cognitive load", "cognition"], "abstract": "Artificial subtle expressions (ASEs) are machine-like expressions used to convey a system's confidence level to users intuitively. In this paper, we focus on the cognitive loads of users in interpreting ASEs in this study. Specifically, we assume that a shorter response time indicates less cognitive load, and we hypothesize that users will show a shorter response time when interpreting ASEs compared with speech sounds. We succeeded in verifying our hypothesis in a web-based investigation done to comprehend participants' cognitive loads by measuring their response times in interpreting ASEs and speeches.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Meiji University", "Shinshu University", "National Institute of Informatics", "Honda", "Ltd., Wako, Saitama, Japan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Takanori Komatsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komatsu:Takanori", "Kazuki Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Kazuki", "Seiji Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Seiji", "Kotaro Funakoshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Funakoshi:Kotaro", "Mikio Nakano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakano:Mikio"], "pages": 5}
