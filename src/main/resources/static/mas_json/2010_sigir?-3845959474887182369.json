That is, estimating the effectiveness of a search performed in response to a query in lack of relevance judgments. Our approach is based on using statistical decision theory for estimating the utility that a document ranking provides with respect to an information need expressed by the query. To address the uncertainty in inferring the information need, we estimate utility by the expected similarity between the given ranking and those induced by  relevance models ; the impact of a relevance model is based on its presumed  representativeness  of the information need. Specific query-performance predictors instantiated from the framework substantially outperform state-of-the-art predictors over five TREC corpora.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "IBM"], "authors": ["Anna Shtok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shtok:Anna", "Oren Kurland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurland:Oren", "David Carmel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carmel:David"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
