{"title": "A Cutoff Technique for the Verification of Parameterised Interpreted Systems with Parameterised Environments.", "fields": ["cutoff", "expressivity", "semantics", "abstraction", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We put forward a cutoff technique for determining the number of agents that is sufficient to consider when checking temporal-epistemic specifications on a system of any size. We identify a special class of interleaved interpreted systems for which we give a parameterised semantics and an abstraction methodology. This enables us to overcome the significant limitations in expressivity present in the state-of-the-art. We present an implementation and discuss experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Panagiotis Kouvaros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kouvaros:Panagiotis", "Alessio Lomuscio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lomuscio:Alessio"], "pages": 7}
