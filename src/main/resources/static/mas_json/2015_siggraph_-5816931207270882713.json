Initially, an input object or scene is decomposed into a collection of constituent components embraced by corresponding  control bounding volumes  which capture the intra-structures of the object or the semantic groupings of the objects in the scene. The overall retargeting is accomplished through a constrained optimization by manipulating the  control bounding volumes . Without inferring the intricate dependencies between the components, we define a minimal set of constraints that maintain the spatial arrangement and connectivity between the components to regularize valid retargeting results. The default retargeting behavior can then be easily altered by additional semantic constraints imposed by users.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "University of British Columbia", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Chun-Kai Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chun=Kai", "Yi-Ling Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yi=Ling", "I-Chao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:I=Chao", "Bing-Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bing=Yu"], "pages": 1}
