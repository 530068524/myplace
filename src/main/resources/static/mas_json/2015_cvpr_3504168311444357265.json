To perform feature selection on unlabeled data effectively, a regularized regression-based formulation with a new type of target matrix is designed. The target matrix captures latent cluster centers of the projected data points by performing orthogonal basis clustering, and then guides the projection matrix to select discriminative features. Unlike the recent unsupervised feature selection methods, SOCFS does not explicitly use the pre-computed local structure information for data points represented as additional terms of their objective functions, but directly computes latent cluster information by the target matrix conducting orthogonal basis clustering in a single unified term of the proposed objective function. It turns out that the proposed objective function can be minimized by a simple optimization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SOCFS achieving the state-of-the-art results with diverse real world datasets.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dongyoon Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Dongyoon", "Junmo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Junmo"], "pages": 8}
