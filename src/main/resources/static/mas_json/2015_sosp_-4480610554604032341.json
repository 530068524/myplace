{"title": "Failure sketching: a technique for automated root cause diagnosis of in-production failures.", "fields": ["debugging", "dynamic program analysis", "root cause", "gist", "static program analysis"], "abstract": "Developers spend a lot of time searching for the root causes of software failures. For this, they traditionally try to reproduce those failures, but unfortunately many failures are so hard to reproduce in a test environment that developers spend days or weeks as ad-hoc detectives. The shortcomings of many solutions proposed for this problem prevent their use in practice.   We propose failure sketching, an automated debugging technique that provides developers with an explanation (\"failure sketch\") of the root cause of a failure that occurred in production. A failure sketch only contains program statements that lead to the failure, and it clearly shows the differences between failing and successful runs; these differences guide developers to the root cause. Our approach combines static program analysis with a cooperative and adaptive form of dynamic program analysis.   We built Gist, a prototype for failure sketching that relies on hardware watchpoints and a new hardware feature for extracting control flow traces (Intel Processor Trace). We show that Gist can build failure sketches with low overhead for failures in systems like Apache, SQLite, and Memcached.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Intel", "Intel", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Baris Kasikci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasikci:Baris", "Benjamin Schubert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schubert:Benjamin", "Cristiano Pereira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pereira:Cristiano", "Gilles Pokam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pokam:Gilles", "George Candea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Candea:George"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2015", "pages": 17}
