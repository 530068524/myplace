The highlight of the developed routing approach is that a node re-routes a packet around the failed link without the knowledge of the second link failure. The proposed technique requires three protection addresses for every node, in addition to the normal address. Associated with every protection address of a node is a protection graph. Each link connected to the node is removed in at least one of protection graphs and every protection graph is guaranteed to be two-edge connected. The network recovers from the first failure by tunneling the packet to the next-hop node using one of the protection addresses of the next-hop node; and the packet is routed over the protection graph corresponding to that protection address. We prove that it is sufficient to provide up to three protection addresses per node to tolerate any arbitrary two link failures in a three-edge connected graph. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique over several network topologies. network recovers from the first failure using IP-in-IP tunneling (RFC2003) using one of the \"protection addresses\" of the next node in the path. Packets destined to the protection address of a node are routed over a protection graph where the failed link is not present. Every protection graph is guaranteed to be two-edge connected by construction, hence is guaranteed to tolerate another link failure. We develop an elegant technique to compute the protection graphs at a node such that each link connected to the node is removed in at least one of protection graphs, and every protection graph is two-edge connected. The highlight of our approach is that we prove that every node requires at most three protection graphs. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II surveys the techniques developed for fast recovery from single link failures. Section III describes the network model. Sec- tion IV describes our approach for dual link failure recovery, proves the requirement of up to three protection addresses per node, and discusses two different approaches to route using colored trees in the protection (auxiliary) graphs. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several networks and present our results in Section V. Our conclusions are presented in Section VI.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "Simula Research Laboratory", "Simula Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Shrinivasa Kini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kini:Shrinivasa", "Srinivasan Ramasubramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramasubramanian:Srinivasan", "Amund Kvalbein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kvalbein:Amund", "Audun Fosselie Hansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hansen:Audun_Fosselie"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
