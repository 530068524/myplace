With the help of shallow parsing, our model learns rules consisting of words and chunks and meanwhile introduce syntax cohesion. Under the weighed synchronous context-free grammar defined by these rules, our model searches for the best translation derivation and yields target translation simultaneously. Our experiments show that our model significantly outperforms the hierarchical phrase-based model and the tree-to-string model on English-Chinese Translation tasks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Sheffield", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yang Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Yang", "Dongdong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dongdong", "Mu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mu", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun"], "pages": 9}
