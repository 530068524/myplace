{"title": "CHIMP: Crowdsourcing Human Inputs for Mobile Phones.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "encryption", "android", "virtualization", "world wide web"], "abstract": "While developing mobile apps is becoming easier, testing and characterizing their behavior is still hard. On the one hand, the de facto testing tool, called \u201c\u201dMonkey,\u201d\u201d scales well due to being based on random inputs, but fails to gather inputs useful in understanding things like user engagement and attention. On the other hand, gathering inputs and data from real users requires distributing instrumented apps, or even phones with pre-installed apps, an expensive and inherently unscalable task.To address these limitations we present CHIMP, a system that integrates automated tools and large-scale crowdsourced inputs. CHIMP is different from previous approaches in that it runs apps in a virtualized mobile environment that thousands of users all over the world can access via a standard Web browser. CHIMP is thus able to gather the full range of real-user inputs, detailed run-time traces of apps, and network traffic.We describe CHIMP\u2019s design and demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by testing thousands of apps via thousands of crowdsourced users. We calibrate CHIMP with a large-scale campaign to understand how users approach app testing tasks. Finally, we show how CHIMP can be used to improve both traditional app testing tasks, as well as more novel tasks such as building a traffic classifier on encrypted network flows.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "AT&T", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Telef\u00f3nica"], "authors": ["M\u00e1rio Almeida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almeida:M=aacute=rio", "Muhammad Bilal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bilal:Muhammad", "Alessandro Finamore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finamore:Alessandro", "Ilias Leontiadis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leontiadis:Ilias", "Yan Grunenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grunenberger:Yan", "Matteo Varvello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varvello:Matteo", "Jeremy Blackburn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blackburn:Jeremy"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
