{"title": "Work capacity of freelance markets: Fundamental limits and decentralized schemes.", "fields": ["software development", "contextual image classification", "popularity", "freedom of choice", "wait"], "abstract": "Crowdsourcing of jobs to online freelance markets is rapidly gaining popularity. Most crowdsourcing platforms are uncontrolled and offer freedom to customers and freelancers to choose each other. This works well for unskilled jobs (e.g., image classification) with no specific quality requirement since freelancers are functionally identical. For skilled jobs (e.g., software development) with specific requirements, however, this does not ensure the maximum number of job requests is satisfied. In this work we determine the capacity of freelance markets, in terms of maximum satisfied job requests, and propose centralized schemes that achieve capacity. To ensure decentralized operation and freedom of choice for customers and freelancers, we propose simple schemes compatible with the operation of current crowd-sourcing platforms that approximately achieve capacity. Further, for settings where job requests exceed capacity, we propose an optimal and fair scheme for declining jobs without wait.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Avhishek Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Avhishek", "Lav R.
