However, it is unclear how user responses are affected by prototype format. We conducted a 2x2 quasi-experiment (video /storyboard format x older and younger user groups) to test for an interaction between prototype format and user group. We found a significant interaction between prototype format and responses across user groups. Our results indicate that differences in user responses can be misinterpreted as the result of user group characteristics. We advise using multiple prototype formats to counteract a 'media effect'. Alternatively, we advise using storyboards for a smaller 'media effect'.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Unviversity of  ... nto, ON, Canada"], "authors": ["Katherine M.
