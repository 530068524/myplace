{"title": "Real-Time Program Execution on NAND Flash Memory for Portable Media Players.", "fields": ["static random access memory", "flash file system", "nand gate", "universal memory", "paging"], "abstract": "NAND flash memory has been widely used as a non-volatile storage for storing data. However, it requires a large amount of SRAM for executing program codes stored in it since it only supports page-based reads, not byte-level random reads. This paper proposes a new paging mechanism called RT-PLRU (real-time constrained combination of pinning and LRU) that allows program codes stored in NAND flash memory to be executed satisfying real-time requirements with minimal usage of SRAM. Moreover, the RT-PLRU is optimally configured in a developer-transparent way without giving any burden to the program developer. The developed technique is specifically applied to a media player program targeting a PMP (portable medial player). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to use NAND flash memory as a code storage for storing and executing real-time programs with minimal usage of SRAM.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Samsung", "Anyang University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Jong-Chan Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jong=Chan", "Duhee Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Duhee", "Chang-Gun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chang=Gun", "Kanghee Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kanghee", "Eun Yong Ha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ha:Eun_Yong"], "pages": 12}
