{"title": "SPARSH: passing data using the body as a medium.", "fields": ["data sharing", "wish", "cloud computing", "internet privacy", "multimedia"], "abstract": "SPARSH explores a novel interaction method to seamlessly transfer data among multiple users and devices in a fun and intuitive way. The user touches a data item they wish to copy from a device, conceptually saving in the user's body. Next, the user touches the other device they want to paste/pass the saved content. SPARSH uses touch-based interactions as indications for what to copy and where to pass it. Technically, the actual transfer of media happens via the information cloud.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Pranav Mistry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mistry:Pranav", "Suranga Nanayakkara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanayakkara:Suranga", "Pattie Maes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maes:Pattie"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
