{"title": "Elicitation for Preferences Single Peaked on Trees.", "fields": ["path cover", "subset and superset", "condorcet method", "unrestricted domain", "pathwidth"], "abstract": "Eliciting preferences of a set of agents over a set of items is a problem of fundamental interest in artificial intelligence in general and social choice theory in particular. Prior works on preference elicitation focus on unrestricted domain and the domain of single peaked preferences and show that the preferences in single peaked domain can be elicited by much less number of queries compared to unrestricted domain. We extend this line of research and study preference elicitation for single peaked preferences on trees which is a strict superset of the domain of single peaked preferences. We show that the query complexity crucially depends on the number of leaves, the path cover number, and the distance from path of the underlying single peaked tree, whereas the other natural parameters like maximum degree, diameter, pathwidth do not play any direct role in determining query complexity. We then investigate the query complexity for finding a weak Condorcet winner for preferences single peaked on a tree and show that this task has much less query complexity than preference elicitation. Here again we observe that the number of leaves in the underlying single peaked tree and the path cover number of the tree influence the query complexity of the problem.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Palash Dey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dey:Palash", "Neeldhara Misra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Misra:Neeldhara"], "pages": 7}
