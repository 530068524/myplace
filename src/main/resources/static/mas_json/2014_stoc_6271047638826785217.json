{"title": "A super-polynomial lower bound for regular arithmetic formulas.", "fields": ["mathematics", "random variate", "algebra", "polynomial", "discrete mathematics", "multiplication", "upper and lower bounds", "binary logarithm", "time complexity"], "abstract": "We consider arithmetic formulas consisting of alternating layers of addition (+) and multiplication (\u00d7) gates such that the fanin of all the gates in any fixed layer is the same. Such a formula \u03a6 which additionally has the property that its formal/syntactic degree is at most twice the (total) degree of its output polynomial, we refer to as a  regular formula . As usual, we allow arbitrary constants from the underlying field F on the incoming edges to a + gate so that a + gate can in fact compute an arbitrary F-linear combination of its inputs. We show that there is an ( n  2  + 1)-variate polynomial of degree 2 n  in VNP such that any regular formula computing it must be of size at least  n  \u03a9(log  n ) .   Along the way, we examine depth four (\u03a3\u03a0\u03a3\u03a0) regular formulas wherein all multiplication gates in the layer adjacent to the inputs have fanin  a  and all multiplication gates in the layer adjacent to the output node have fanin  b . We refer to such formulas as \u03a3\u03a0 [ b ] \u03a3\u03a0 [ a ] -formulas. We show that there exists an  n  2 -variate polynomial of degree  n  in VNP such that any \u03a3\u03a0 [ O (\u221a n )] \u03a3\u03a0 [\u221a n ] -formula computing it must have top fan-in at least 2 \u03a9(\u221a n \u00b7log  n ) . In comparison, Tavenas [Tav13] has recently shown that every  n   O (1) -variate polynomial of degree  n  in VP admits a \u03a3\u03a0 [ O (\u221a n )] \u03a3\u03a0 [\u221a n ] -formula of top fan-in 2  O (\u221a n \u00b7log  n ) . This means that any further asymptotic improvement in our lower bound for such formulas (to say 2  \u03c9 (\u221a n  log  n ) ) will imply that VP is different from VNP.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Indian Institute of Science", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Neeraj Kayal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kayal:Neeraj", "Chandan Saha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saha_0001:Chandan", "Ramprasad Saptharishi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saptharishi:Ramprasad"], "pages": 8}
