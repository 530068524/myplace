Nevertheless, large complicated software systems can have large models, motivating the need for slicing techniques that reduce the size of a model. We present a generalization of observation-based slicing that allows the criterion to be defined using a variety of kinds of observable behavior and does not require any complex dependence analysis. We apply our implementation of generalized observational slicing for tree-structured representations to Simulink models. The resulting slice might be the subset of the original model responsible for an observed failure or simply the sub-model semantically related to a classic slicing criterion. Unlike its predecessors, the algorithm is also capable of slicing embedded Stateflow state machines. A study of nine real-world models drawn from four different application domains demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach at dramatically reducing Simulink model sizes for realistic observation scenarios: for 9 out of 20 cases, the resulting model has fewer than 25% of the original model's elements.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University College London", "Loyola University Maryland", "University College London", "University of East London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Nicolas E.
