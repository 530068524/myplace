With the advent of new 3D sensors, many 3D facial datasets have been collected containing both neutral as well as expressive faces. However, all datasets are captured under controlled conditions. Thus, even though powerful 3D facial shape models can be learnt from such data, it is difficult to build statistical texture models that are sufficient to reconstruct faces captured in unconstrained conditions (in-the-wild). In this paper, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, in-the-wild 3DMM by combining a powerful statistical model of facial shape, which describes both identity and expression, with an in-the-wild texture model. We show that the employment of such an in-the-wild texture model greatly simplifies the fitting procedure, because there is no need to optimise with regards to the illumination parameters. Furthermore, we propose a new fast algorithm for fitting the 3DMM in arbitrary images. Finally, we have captured the first 3D facial database with relatively unconstrained conditions and report quantitative evaluations with state-of-the-art performance. Complementary qualitative reconstruction results are demonstrated on standard in-the-wild facial databases.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Amazon.com", "Imperial College London", "Middlesex University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["James Booth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Booth:James", "Epameinondas Antonakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antonakos:Epameinondas", "Stylianos Ploumpis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ploumpis:Stylianos", "George Trigeorgis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trigeorgis:George", "Yannis Panagakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panagakis:Yannis", "Stefanos Zafeiriou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zafeiriou:Stefanos"], "pages": 10}
