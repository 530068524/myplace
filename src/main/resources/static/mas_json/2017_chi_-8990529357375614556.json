{"title": "Better Organization or a Source of Distraction?: Introducing Digital Peer Feedback to a Paper-Based Classroom.", "fields": ["design education", "game design", "peer feedback", "computer supported collaborative learning", "distraction"], "abstract": "Peer feedback is a central activity for project-based design education. The prevalence of devices carried by students and the emergence of novel peer feedback systems enables the possibility of collecting and sharing feedback immediately between students during class. However, pen and paper is thought to be more familiar, less distracting for students, and easier for instructors to implement and manage. To evaluate the efficacy of in-class digital feedback systems, we conducted a within-subjects study with 73 students during two weeks of a game design course. After short student presentations, while instructors provided verbal feedback, peers provided feedback either on paper or through a device. The study found that both methods yielded comments of similar quality and quantity, but the digital approach provided additional ways for students to participate and required less effort from the instructors. While both methods produced similar behaviors, students held inaccurate perceptions about their behavior with each method. We discuss design implications for technologies to support in-class feedback exchange.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, San Diego", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Amy Shannon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shannon:Amy", "Alex Sciuto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sciuto:Alex", "Danielle Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Danielle", "Steven P.
