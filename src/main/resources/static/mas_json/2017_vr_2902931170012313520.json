However, little is known about the impact such immersive experiences will have on children (aged 0\u201318 years). This paper outlines perspectives on child development to present conceptual and practical frameworks for conducting ethical research with children using immersive HMD technologies. The paper addresses not only procedural ethics (gaining institutional approval) but also ethics-in-practice (on-going ethical decision-making).", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Newcastle", "University of Newcastle", "University of Newcastle"], "authors": ["Erica Southgate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Southgate:Erica", "Shamus P.
