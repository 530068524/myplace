We describe a longitudinal dataset of N/V pair pronunciations, leading to a set of properties to be accounted for by any computational model. We analyze the dynamics of 5 dynamical systems models of linguistic populations, each derived from a model of learning by individuals. We compare each model's dynamics to a set of properties observed in the N/V data, and reason about how assumptions about individual learning affect population-level dynamics.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Morgan Sonderegger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sonderegger:Morgan", "Partha Niyogi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niyogi:Partha"], "pages": 11}
