To date, the approach providing highest security is triple encryption (used e.g. in Triple-DES), which was proved to have roughly \u03ba+min {n/2, \u03ba/2} bits of security when instantiated with ideal block ciphers with key length \u03ba and block length n, at the cost of three block-cipher calls per message block.\n\nThis paper presents a new practical key-length extension scheme exhibiting \u03ba+n/2 bits of security --- hence improving upon the security of triple encryption --- solely at the cost of two block cipher calls and a key of length \u03ba+n. We also provide matching generic attacks showing the optimality of the security level achieved by our approach with respect to a general class of two-query constructions.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Comenius University in Bratislava", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Peter Gazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gazi:Peter", "Stefano Tessaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tessaro:Stefano"], "pages": 18}
