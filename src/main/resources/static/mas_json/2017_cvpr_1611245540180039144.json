It is simple and does not require specialized hardware. We prewarp and align a specially designed projection pattern onto a printed pattern of different colorimetric properties. After capturing the patterns in several orientations, we perform geometric calibration by estimating the corner locations of the two patterns in different color channels. We perform radiometric calibration of the projector by using the information contained inside the projected squares. We show that our method performs on par with current approaches that all require separate geometric and radiometric calibration, while being more efficient and user friendly.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Marjan Shahpaski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahpaski:Marjan", "Luis Ricardo Sapaico.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sapaico:Luis_Ricardo", "Gaspard Chevassus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chevassus:Gaspard", "Sabine S\u00fcsstrunk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=uuml=sstrunk:Sabine"], "pages": 9}
