Existing methods are too generic and so far have not demonstrated competitive results for any specific task. In this paper we overcome this limitation by adding two new aspects to cosegmentation: (1) the \u201csomething\u201d has to be an object, and (2) the \u201csimilarity\u201d measure is learned. In this way, we are able to achieve excellent results on the recently introduced iCoseg dataset, which contains small sets of images of either the same object instance or similar objects of the same class. The challenge of this dataset lies in the extreme changes in viewpoint, lighting, and object deformations within each set. We are able to considerably outperform several competitors. To achieve this performance, we borrow recent ideas from object recognition: the use of powerful features extracted from a pool of candidate object-like segmentations. We believe that our work will be beneficial to several application areas, such as image retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (245)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University College London", "Microsoft", "University College London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sara Vicente.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vicente:Sara", "Carsten Rother.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rother:Carsten", "Vladimir Kolmogorov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolmogorov:Vladimir"], "pages": 8}
