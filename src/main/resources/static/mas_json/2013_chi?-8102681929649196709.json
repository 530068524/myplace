Using an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) based approach, we show how piracy not only fuels media consumption, but also drives further technology adoption and promotes digital literacy. To do this, we first uncover the role of piracy as a legitimate actor that brings ICT capability to underserved communities and reveal the heterogeneous character of the pirated mobile media distribution and consumption infrastructure in India. We then emphasize the benefits of an ANT-based theory-driven analysis to HCI's efforts in this arena. In particular, ANT enables us to one, draw attention to the ties in the pirate media network that facilitate the increased  decentralization  of piracy in India; two, highlight the progressive transition from the  outsourcing  to the  self-sourcing  of users' media needs as this network evolves; and three, recognize the agency of human and  non-human entities  in this inherently sociotechnical ecosystem.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Neha Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Neha", "Nimmi Rangaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangaswamy:Nimmi"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
