{"title": "Differential privacy for the analyst via private equilibrium computation.", "fields": ["data mining", "differential privacy", "computation", "zero sum game", "privacy software"], "abstract": "We give new mechanisms for answering exponentially many queries from multiple analysts on a private database, while protecting dif- ferential privacy both for the individuals in the database and for the analysts. That is, our mechanism's answer to each query is nearly insensitive to changes in the queries asked by other analysts. Our mechanism is the first to offer differential privacy on the joint distribution over analysts' answers, providing privacy for data an- alysts even if the other data analysts collude or register multiple accounts. In some settings, we are able to achieve nearly optimal error rates (even compared to mechanisms which do not offer an- alyst privacy), and we are able to extend our techniques to handle non-linear queries. Our analysis is based on a novel view of the pri- vate query-release problem as a two-player zero-sum game, which may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "Harvard University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Justin Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Justin", "Aaron Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Aaron", "Jonathan Ullman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ullman:Jonathan"], "pages": 10}
