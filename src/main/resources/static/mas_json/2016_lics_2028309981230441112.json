{"title": "Reasoning about Recursive Probabilistic Programs.", "fields": ["pushdown automaton", "soundness", "probabilistic logic", "semantics", "recursion"], "abstract": "This paper presents a wp--style calculus for obtaining expectations on the outcomes of (mutually) recursive probabilistic programs. We provide several proof rules to derive one-- and two--sided bounds for such expectations, and show the soundness of our wp--calculus with respect to a probabilistic pushdown automaton semantics. We also give a wp--style calculus for obtaining bounds on the expected runtime of recursive programs that can be used to determine the (possibly infinite) time until termination of such programs.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Federico Olmedo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olmedo:Federico", "Benjamin Lucien Kaminski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaminski:Benjamin_Lucien", "Joost-Pieter Katoen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katoen:Joost=Pieter", "Christoph Matheja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matheja:Christoph"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
