{"title": "On Decidability of Prebisimulation for Timed Automata.", "fields": ["timed automaton", "real number", "algorithm", "bisimulation", "decidability"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an at least as fast as relation between two timed automata states and investigate its decidability. The proposed relation is a prebisimulation and we show that given two processes with rational clock valuations it is decidable whether such a prebisimulation relation exists between them. Though bisimulation relations have been widely studied with respect to timed systems and timed automata, prebisimulations in timed systems form a much lesser studied area and according to our knowledge, this is the first of the kind where we study the decidability of a timed prebisimulation. This prebisimulation has been termed timed performance prebisimulation since it compares the efficiency of two states in terms of their performances in performing actions. if s and t are time abstracted bisimilar and every possible delay by s and its successors is no more than the delays performed by t and its successors where the delays are real numbers. The prebisimilarity defined here falls in between timed and time abstracted bisimilarity.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Shibashis Guha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guha:Shibashis", "Chinmay Narayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayan:Chinmay", "S.
