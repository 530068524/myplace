{"title": "Mixing Search Strategies for Multi-Player Games.", "fields": ["adversary", "minimax", "search algorithm", "offensive", "strategy"], "abstract": "There are two basic approaches to generalize the propagation mechanism of the two-player Minimax search algorithm to multi-player (3 or more) games: the MaxN algorithm and the Paranoid algorithm. The main shortcoming of these approaches is that their strategy is fixed. In this paper we suggest a new approach (called MP-Mix) that dynamically changes the propagation strategy based on the players' relative strengths between MaxN, Paranoid and a newly presented offensive strategy. In addition, we introduce the Opponent Impact factor for multi-player games, which measures the players' ability to impact their opponents' score, and show its relation to the relative performance of our new MP-Mix strategy. Experimental results show that MP-Mix outperforms all other approaches under most circumstances.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Bar-Ilan University"], "authors": ["Inon Zuckerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuckerman:Inon", "Ariel Felner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felner:Ariel", "Sarit Kraus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraus:Sarit"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
