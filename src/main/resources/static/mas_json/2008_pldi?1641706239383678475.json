Our technique exploits two observations: First, using quantified, recursive formulas, path- and context-sensitive conditions for many program properties can be expressed exactly. To compute a closed form solution to such recursive constraints, we differentiate between  observable  and  unobservable  variables, the latter of which are existentially quantified in our approach. Using the insight that unobservable variables can be eliminated outside a certain scope, our technique computes satisfiability- and validity-preserving closed-form solutions to the original recursive constraints. We prove the solution is as precise as the original system for answering may and must queries as well as being small in practice, allowing our technique to scale to the entire Linux kernel, a program with over 6 million lines of code.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Isil Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Isil", "Thomas Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Thomas", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2008", "pages": 11}
