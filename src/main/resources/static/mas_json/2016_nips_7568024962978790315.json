{"title": "Constraints Based Convex Belief Propagation.", "fields": ["local consistency", "random field", "bottleneck", "order of magnitude", "belief propagation"], "abstract": "Inference in Markov random fields subject to consistency structure is a fundamental problem that arises in many real-life applications. In order to enforce consistency, classical approaches utilize consistency potentials or encode constraints over feasible instances. Unfortunately this comes at the price of a serious computational bottleneck. In this paper we suggest to tackle consistency by incorporating constraints on beliefs. This permits derivation of a closed-form message-passing algorithm which we refer to as the Constraints Based Convex Belief Propagation (CBCBP). Experiments show that CBCBP outperforms the standard approach while being at least an order of magnitude faster.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Toyota Technological Institute", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yaniv Tenzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tenzer:Yaniv", "Alexander G.
