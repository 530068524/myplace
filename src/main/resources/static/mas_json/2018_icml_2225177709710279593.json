{"title": "Fast Gradient-Based Methods with Exponential Rate: A Hybrid Control Framework.", "fields": ["dynamical system", "scalar", "exponential function", "discretization", "ordinary differential equation"], "abstract": "Ordinary differential equations, and in general a dynamical system viewpoint, have seen a resurgence of interest in developing fast optimization methods, mainly thanks to the availability of well-established analysis tools. In this study, we pursue a similar objective and propose a class of hybrid control systems that adopts a 2nd-order differential equation as its continuous flow. A distinctive feature of the proposed differential equation in comparison with the existing literature is a state-dependent, time-invariant damping term that acts as a feedback control input. Given a user-defined scalar \u03b1, it is shown that the proposed control input steers the state trajectories to the global optimizer of a desired objective function with a guaranteed rate of convergence O(e\u2212\u03b1t). Our framework requires that the objective function satisfies the so called Polyak\u2013{\u0141}ojasiewicz inequality. Furthermore, a discretization method is introduced such that the resulting discrete dynamical system possesses an exponential rate of convergence.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Arman Sharifi Kolarijani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolarijani:Arman_Sharifi", "Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esfahani:Peyman_Mohajerin", "Tam\u00e1s Keviczky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keviczky:Tam=aacute=s"], "pages": 9}
