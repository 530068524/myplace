By applying regret minimization techniques, we devise an efficient online learning algorithm for the problem, without assuming that the error terms comply with a specific distribution. We show that our algorithm can be adjusted to provide confidence bounds for its predictions, and provide an application to ARCH models. The theoretical results are corroborated by an empirical study.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Oren Anava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anava:Oren", "Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie"], "pages": 9}
