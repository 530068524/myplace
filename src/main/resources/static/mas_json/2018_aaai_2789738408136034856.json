However, this problem has not been studied in large-scale conversation generation so far. In this paper, we propose Emotional Chatting Machine (ECM) that can generate appropriate responses not only in content (relevant and grammatical) but also in emotion (emotionally consistent). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. ECM addresses the factor using three new mechanisms that respectively (1) models the high-level abstraction of emotion expressions by embedding emotion categories, (2) captures the change of implicit internal emotion states, and (3) uses explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary. Experiments show that the proposed model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Hao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Hao", "Minlie Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Minlie", "Tianyang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tianyang", "Xiaoyan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoyan", "Bing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Bing"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
