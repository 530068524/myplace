It also highly depends on the tutorial designer's skill level and experience. This paper introduces an approach which automatically generates software tutorials using the digital artifacts produced by the users of a software program. We model this process as an optimal planning problem using software produced artifacts, software specifications and the human-computer interaction Keystroke-Level Model (KLM). We present TutorialPlan, an automated tutorial generator, which creates step-by-step text and image instructions from CAD drawings and helps users learn AutoCAD, a complex design and drafting software. In our tutorial generator, the optimal planning problem is represented and solved using DLV, a general Answer Set Programming (ASP) system. DLV offers a natural representation of both the problem and the heuristics needed to solve it efficiently. A user study shows that the tutorials generated by our system are comparable to those generated by experienced AutoCAD users.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Autodesk", "Texas Tech University", "Autodesk"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Wei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0002:Wei", "Yuanlin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yuanlin", "George W.
