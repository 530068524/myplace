{"title": "CliqueSquare in action: Flat plans for massively parallel RDF queries.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "web query classification", "rdf schema", "sargable", "sparql"], "abstract": "RDF is an increasingly popular data model for many practical applications, leading to large volumes of RDF data; efficient RDF data management methods are crucial to allow applications to scale. We propose to demonstrate CliqueSquare, an RDF data management system built on top of a MapReduce-like infrastructure. The main technical novelty of CliqueSquare resides in its logical query optimization algorithm, guaranteed to find a logical plan as flat as possible for a given query, meaning: a plan having the smallest possible number of join operators on top of each other. CliqueSquare's ability to build flat plans allows it to take advantage of a parallel processing framework in order to shorten response times. We demonstrate loading and querying the data, with a particular focus on query optimization, and on the performance benefits of CliqueSquare's flat plans.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Institute for the Management of Information Systems", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "U.
