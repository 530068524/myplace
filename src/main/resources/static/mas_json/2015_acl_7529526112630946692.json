{"title": "Language to Code: Learning Semantic Parsers for If-This-Then-That Recipes.", "fields": ["executable", "natural language", "training set", "computational linguistics", "parsing"], "abstract": "Using natural language to write programs is a touchstone problem for computational linguistics. We present an approach that learns to map natural-language descriptions of simple \u201cif-then\u201d rules to executable code. By training and testing on a large corpus of naturally-occurring programs (called \u201crecipes\u201d) and their natural language descriptions, we demonstrate the ability to effectively map language to code. We compare a number of semantic parsing approaches on the highly noisy training data collected from ordinary users, and find that loosely synchronous systems perform best.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Texas at Austin", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Chris Quirk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quirk:Chris", "Raymond J.
