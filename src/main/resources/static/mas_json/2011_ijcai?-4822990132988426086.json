{"title": "Recommender Systems, Missing Data and Statistical Model Estimation.", "fields": ["data set", "ranking", "missing data", "recommender system", "statistical model"], "abstract": "The goal of rating-based recommender systems is to make personalized predictions and recommendations for individual users by leveraging the preferences of a community of users with respect to a collection of items like songs or movies. Recommender systems are often based on intricate statistical models that are estimated from data sets containing a very high proportion of missing ratings. This work describes evidence of a basic incompatibility between the properties of recommender system data sets and the assumptions required for valid estimation and evaluation of statistical models in the presence of missing data. We discuss the implications of this problem and describe extended modelling and evaluation frameworks that attempt to circumvent it. We present prediction and ranking results showing that models developed and tested under these extended frameworks can significantly outperform standard models.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of Toronto", "New York University", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Benjamin M.
