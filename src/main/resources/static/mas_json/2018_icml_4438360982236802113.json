{"title": "Composable Planning with Attributes.", "fields": ["graph", "principle of compositionality", "pattern recognition", "reinforcement learning", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The tasks that an agent will need to solve often aren\u2019t known during training. However, if the agent knows which properties of the environment we consider im- portant, then after learning how its actions affect those properties the agent may be able to use this knowledge to solve complex tasks without training specifi- cally for them. Towards this end, we consider a setup in which an environment is augmented with a set of user defined attributes that parameterize the features of interest. We propose a model that learns a policy for transitioning between \u201cnearby\u201d sets of attributes, and maintains a graph of possible transitions. Given a task at test time that can be expressed in terms of a target set of attributes, and a current state, our model infers the attributes of the current state and searches over paths through attribute space to get a high level plan, and then uses its low level policy to execute the plan. We show in grid-world games and 3D block stacking that our model is able to generalize to longer, more complex tasks at test time even when it only sees short, simple tasks at train time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Facebook", "Facebook", "New York University", "New York University", "Facebook"], "authors": ["Amy Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Amy", "Sainbayar Sukhbaatar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sukhbaatar:Sainbayar", "Adam Lerer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerer:Adam", "Arthur Szlam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szlam:Arthur", "Rob Fergus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fergus:Rob"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
