However, they are inherently sequential in their design which prevents them from taking advantage of modern multi-core architectures. In this paper we prove that online learning with delayed updates converges well, thereby facilitating parallel online learning.", "citation": "Citations (270)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Yahoo!", "1 and 2"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Martin Zinkevich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zinkevich:Martin", "Alexander J.
