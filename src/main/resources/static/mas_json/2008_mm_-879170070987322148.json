Efficient search of media data still remains a distant goal. Tagging has been used recently to bridge the \"semantic gap\" for images. Tagging of video data poses several challenges. The temporal nature of video requires support from the media player for video tagging. Unlike images which can be tagged simultaneously with viewing, tagging of video is typically not done at first viewing: videos are best tagged after viewing them at least once in entirety. This is not a preferred solution since the entire video has to be played again for tagging. In this paper, we propose a compact representation called \"tagboard\" which reduces the cognitive overload associated with video tagging. Tagboard also facilitates tag propagation. The technique is based on image similarity and dimensionality reduction. The ease of tagging improves metadata creation there by improving social search.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"], "authors": ["S. H.
