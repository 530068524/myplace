Humans however can no longer keep up with providing strong and time consuming annotations on the ever increasing wealth of visual data. As a result, approaches are required that can learn from fast and weak forms of annotations in visual data. This doctorial symposium summarizes my ongoing PhD dissertation on how to utilize weakly-supervised annotations to recognize, localize, and explain visual entities in images and videos. In this context, visual entities denote objects, scenes, and actions (in images), and actions and events (in videos). The summary is performed through four publications. For each publication, we discuss the current state-of-the-art, as well as our proposed novelties and performed experiments. The end of the summary discusses several possibilities to extend the dissertation.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Pascal Mettes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mettes:Pascal"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 5}
