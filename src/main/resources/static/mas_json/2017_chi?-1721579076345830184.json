{"title": "Technologies and Social Justice Outcomes in Sex Work Charities: Fighting Stigma, Saving Lives.", "fields": ["criminal justice", "human rights", "sex work", "ethnography", "politics"], "abstract": "Sex workers' rights are human rights, and as such are an issue inherently based in social, criminal, and political justice debates. As HCI continues to move towards feminist and social justice oriented research and design approaches, we argue that we need to take into consideration the difficulties faced by sex workers; and explore how technology can and does mediate social justice outcomes for them. We contribute directly to this challenge by providing an empirical account of a charity whose work is built on the underlying move towards social and criminal justice for sex workers in the UK. Through ethnographic fieldwork, meetings, interviews, surveys, and creative workshops we describe the different points of view associated with the charity from a variety of stakeholders. We discuss their service provision and the ways in which HCI is uniquely positioned to be able respond to the needs of and to support sex work support services.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Northumbria University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Angelika Strohmayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strohmayer:Angelika", "Mary Laing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laing:Mary", "Rob Comber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Comber:Rob"], "pages": 13}
