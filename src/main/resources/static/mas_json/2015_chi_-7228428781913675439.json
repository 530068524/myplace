{"title": "Situated Social Media Use: A Methodological Approach to Locating Social Media Practices and Trajectories.", "fields": ["big data", "social media", "museology", "situated", "social photography"], "abstract": "In this paper we draw upon a number of explorations of social media activities, trying to capture and understand them as located, situated practices. This methodological endeavor spans over analyzing patterns in big data feeds (here Instagram) as well as small-scale video-based ethnographic studies of user activities. A situated social media perspective involves examining how social media production and consumption are intertwined. Drawing upon our studies of social media use in cultural institutions we show how visitors orient to their social media presence while attending to physical space during a visit, and how editing and sharing processes are formed by the trajectory through a space. We discuss the application and relevance of this approach for understanding social media and social photography in situ.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Gothenburg", "University of Gothenburg"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Thomas Hillman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hillman:Thomas", "Alexandra Weilenmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weilenmann:Alexandra"], "pages": 4}
