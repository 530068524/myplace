In this paper we consider autonomous devices that maximize their own performance by choosing one of many wireless access points for computation offloading. We develop a game theoretic model of the problem, prove the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria, and provide a polynomial time algorithm for computing an equilibrium. For the case when the cloud computing resources scale with the number of mobile devices we show that all improvement paths are finite. We provide a bound on the price of anarchy of the game, thus our algorithm serves as an approximation algorithm for the global computation offloading cost minimization problem. We use extensive simulations to provide insight into the performance and the convergence time of the algorithms in various scenarios. Our results show that the equilibrium cost may be close to optimal, and the convergence time is almost linear in the number of mobile devices.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sladana Josilo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Josilo:Sladana", "Gy\u00f6rgy D\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=aacute=n:Gy=ouml=rgy"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
