By explicitly modeling the underlying generative process that combines the individual source emissions, highly structured data are expressed with substantially fewer clusters compared to single-assignment clustering. As a consequence, such a model provides robust parameter estimators even when the number of samples is low. We extend the model with different noise processes and demonstrate that maximum-likelihood estimation with multiple assignments consistently infers source parameters more accurately than single-assignment clustering. Our model is primarily motivated by the task of role mining for role-based access control, where users of a system are assigned one or more roles. In experiments with real-world access-control data, our model exhibits better generalization performance than state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Phonak AG, Adva ... a, Switzerland"], "authors": ["Andreas P.
