We construct an affine morphological scale space (AMSS) representation [1], which performs anisotropic diffusion while preserving boundaries and being invariant to affine transformations. We extract the transition boundaries of the diffusivity velocity map and track their evolution at each level of the scale-space. We then determine the stability of the boundary shape through a minimization process over different scales. Unlike most state of the art detectors which use the Gaussian scale space for multi-scale image representation, our approach is intrinsically affine invariant. We evaluate our detector by measuring repeatability of regions in transformed images of the same scene and comparing it to the state-of-the-art region detectors [2].", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Laboratory of D ...
