{"title": "On delay and regret determinization of max-plus automata.", "fields": ["deterministic automaton", "existential quantification", "absolute difference", "semiring", "exptime"], "abstract": "Decidability of the determinization problem for weighted automata over the semiring (\u2124\u222a{\u2212\u221e}, max; +), WA for short, is a long-standing open question. We propose two ways of approaching it by constraining the search space of deterministic WA: k-delay and r-regret. A WA N is k-delay determinizable if there exists a deterministic automaton D that defines the same function as N and for all words \u03b1 in the language of N, the accepting run of D on \u03b1 is always at most k-away from a maximal accepting run of N on \u03b1. That is, along all prefixes of the same length, the absolute difference between the running sums of weights of the two runs is at most k. A WA N is r-regret determinizable if for all words \u03b1 in its language, its non-determinism can be resolved on the fly to construct a run of N such that the absolute difference between its value and the value assigned to \u03b1 by N is at most r. We show that a WA is determinizable if and only if it is k-delay determinizable for some k. Hence deciding the existence of some k is as difficult as the general determinization problem. When k and r are given as input, the k-delay and r-regret determinization problems are shown to be EXPTIME-complete. We also show that determining whether a WA is r-regret determinizable for some r is in EXPTIME.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles"], "authors": ["Emmanuel Filiot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filiot:Emmanuel", "Isma\u00ebl Jecker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jecker:Isma=euml=l", "Nathan Lhote.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lhote:Nathan", "Guillermo A.
