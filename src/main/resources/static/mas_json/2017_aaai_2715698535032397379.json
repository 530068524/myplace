{"title": "Approximation and Parameterized Complexity of Minimax Approval Voting.", "fields": ["minimax", "approval voting", "closest string", "parameterized complexity", "exponential time hypothesis"], "abstract": "We present three results on the complexity of Minimax Approval Voting. First, we study Minimax Approval Voting parameterized by the Hamming distance $d$ from the solution to the votes. We show Minimax Approval Voting admits no algorithm running in time $\\mathcal{O}^\\star(2^{o(d\\log d)})$, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. This means that the $\\mathcal{O}^\\star(d^{2d})$ algorithm of Misra et al. [AAMAS 2015] is essentially optimal. Motivated by this, we then show a parameterized approximation scheme, running in time $\\mathcal{O}^\\star(\\left({3}/{\\epsilon}\\right)^{2d})$, which is essentially tight assuming ETH. Finally, we get a new polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme for Minimax Approval Voting, which runs in time $n^{\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2 \\cdot \\log(1/\\epsilon))} \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(m)$, almost matching the running time of the fastest known PTAS for Closest String due to Ma and Sun [SIAM J. Comp. 2009].", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw"], "authors": ["Marek Cygan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cygan:Marek", "Lukasz Kowalik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kowalik:Lukasz", "Arkadiusz Socala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Socala:Arkadiusz", "Krzysztof Sornat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sornat:Krzysztof"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
