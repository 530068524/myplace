For deadlock detection, D-Finder applies proof strategies to eliminate potential deadlocks by computing increasingly stronger invariants.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Joseph Fourier University", "Joseph Fourier University", "Joseph Fourier University", "Joseph Fourier University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Saddek Bensalem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bensalem:Saddek", "Marius Bozga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bozga:Marius", "Thanh-Hung Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Thanh=Hung", "Joseph Sifakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sifakis:Joseph"], "pages": 6}
