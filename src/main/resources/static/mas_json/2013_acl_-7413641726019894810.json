Different from most previous work where different error types are corrected independently, our proposed inference process considers all possible errors in a uni ed framework. We use integer linear programming (ILP) to model the inference process, which can easily incorporate both the power of existing error classi ers and prior knowledge on grammatical error correction. Experimental results on the Helping Our Own shared task show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art systems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yuanbin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yuanbin", "Hwee Tou Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Hwee_Tou"], "pages": 10}
