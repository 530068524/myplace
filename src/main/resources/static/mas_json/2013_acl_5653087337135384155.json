{"title": "A Sentence Compression Based Framework to Query-Focused Multi-Document Summarization.", "fields": ["beam search", "sentence", "multi document summarization", "parsing", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of using sentence compression techniques to facilitate queryfocused multi-document summarization. We present a sentence-compression-based framework for the task, and design a series of learning-based compression models built on parse trees. An innovative beam search decoder is proposed to efficiently find highly probable compressions. Under this framework, we show how to integrate various indicative metrics such as linguistic motivation and query relevance into the compression process by deriving a novel formulation of a compression scoring function. Our best model achieves statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art systems on several metrics (e.g. 8.0% and 5.4% improvements in ROUGE-2 respectively) for the DUC 2006 and 2007 summarization task.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Cornell University", "IBM", "IBM", "Cornell University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Lu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0008:Lu", "Hema Raghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavan:Hema", "Vittorio Castelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castelli:Vittorio", "Radu Florian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Florian:Radu", "Claire Cardie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cardie:Claire"], "pages": 11}
