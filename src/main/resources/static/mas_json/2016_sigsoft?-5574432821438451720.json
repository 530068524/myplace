We present a technique for minimizing the output of such tools. Our technique accounts for the non-deterministic behavior of mobile apps, producing small event traces that reach a desired activity with high probability.     We propose a variant of delta debugging, augmented to handle non-determinism, to solve the problem of trace minimization. We evaluate our algorithm on two sets of commercial and open-source Android applications, showing that we can minimize large event traces reaching a particular application activity, producing traces that are, on average, less than 2% the size of the original traces.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Lazaro Clapp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clapp:Lazaro", "Osbert Bastani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bastani:Osbert", "Saswat Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Saswat", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
