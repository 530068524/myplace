We extend the standard models for active learner to define a system for this task that first selects the image whose expected label will reduce the uncertainty of the other unlabeled images the most, and then after greedily selects, from the pool of unsegmented images, the most informative image. The results of our experiments, over two real-world datasets (segmenting brain tumors within magnetic resonance images; and segmenting the sky in real images) show that training on very few informative images (here, as few as 2) can produce a segmenter that is as good as training on the entire dataset.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Alireza Farhangfar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farhangfar:Alireza", "Russell Greiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greiner:Russell", "Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szepesv=aacute=ri:Csaba"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
