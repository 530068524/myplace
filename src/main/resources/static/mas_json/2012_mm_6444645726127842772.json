{"title": "XKin -: eXtendable hand pose and gesture recognition library for kinect.", "fields": ["multimedia", "software", "gesture", "license", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "In this work we provide an open-source framework for Kinect enabling more natural and intuitive hand-gesture communication between human and computer devices. The software package is endowed with useful tools for training the system to work with user-defined postures and gestures. The XKin project is fully implemented in C and freely available at https://github.com/fpeder/XKin under FreeBSD License. Our goal is to encourage contributions from other researchers and developers in building an open and effective system for empowering a natural modality for human-machine interaction.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Brescia", "University of Brescia", "University of Brescia", "University of Brescia"], "authors": ["Fabrizio Pedersoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedersoli:Fabrizio", "Nicola Adami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adami:Nicola", "Sergio Benini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benini:Sergio", "Riccardo Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Riccardo"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
