However, it has remained a challenge to achieve fully automated analyses yielding guarantees that hold against computational (rather than symbolic) attacks. This paper meets this challenge for public-key encryption schemes built from trapdoor permutations and hash functions. Using a novel combination of techniques from computational and symbolic cryptography, we present proof systems for analyzing the chosen-plaintext and chosen-ciphertext security of such schemes in the random oracle model. Building on these proof systems, we develop a toolset that bundles together fully automated proof and attack finding algorithms. We use this toolset to build a comprehensive database of encryption schemes that records attacks against insecure schemes, and proofs with concrete bounds for secure ones.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["IMDEA", "IMDEA", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "IMDEA", "U. de Grenoble  ... renoble, France"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Gilles Barthe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthe:Gilles", "Juan Manuel Crespo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crespo:Juan_Manuel", "Benjamin Gr\u00e9goire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=eacute=goire:Benjamin", "C\u00e9sar Kunz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunz:C=eacute=sar", "Yassine Lakhnech.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lakhnech:Yassine", "Benedikt Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Benedikt", "Santiago Zanella B\u00e9guelin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=eacute=guelin:Santiago_Zanella"], "pages": 14}
