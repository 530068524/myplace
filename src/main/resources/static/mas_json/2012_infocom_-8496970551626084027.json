{"title": "Real-time status: How often should one update?", "fields": ["network packet", "queue", "class of service", "first come first served", "service system"], "abstract": "Increasingly ubiquitous communication networks and connectivity via portable devices have engendered a host of applications in which sources, for example people and environmental sensors, send updates of their status to interested recipients. These applications desire status updates at the recipients to be as timely as possible; however, this is typically constrained by limited network resources. In this paper, we employ a time-average age metric for the performance evaluation of status update systems. We derive general methods for calculating the age metric that can be applied to a broad class of service systems. We apply these methods to queue-theoretic system abstractions consisting of a source, a service facility and monitors, with the model of the service facility (physical constraints) a given. The queue discipline of first-come-first-served (FCFS) is explored. We show the existence of an optimal rate at which a source must generate its information to keep its status as timely as possible at all its monitors. This rate differs from those that maximize utilization (throughput) or minimize status packet delivery delay. While our abstractions are simpler than their real-world counterparts, the insights obtained, we believe, are a useful starting point in understanding and designing systems that support real time status updates.", "citation": "Citations (160)", "departments": ["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Sanjit Krishnan Kaul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaul:Sanjit_Krishnan", "Roy D.
