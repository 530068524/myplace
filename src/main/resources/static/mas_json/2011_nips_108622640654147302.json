Conversely, circuit computations with spiking neurons are usually formalized without regard to the rich nonlinear nature of dendritic processing. Here we address the computational challenge faced by neurons that compute and represent analogue quantities but communicate with digital spikes, and show that reliable computation of even purely linear functions of inputs can require the interplay of strongly nonlinear subunits within the postsynaptic dendritic tree. Our theory predicts a matching of dendritic nonlinearities and synaptic weight distributions to the joint statistics of presynaptic inputs. This approach suggests normative roles for some puzzling forms of nonlinear dendritic dynamics and plasticity.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Bal\u00e1zs Ujfalussy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ujfalussy:Bal=aacute=zs", "M\u00e1t\u00e9 Lengyel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lengyel:M=aacute=t=eacute="], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
