In this paper, we develop a distributed self-stabilizing CDS construction algorithm under the SINR model (also known as the physical interference model), a more practical yet more challenging interference model for distributed algorithm design. Specifically, we propose a randomized distributed algorithm that can construct a CDS in O (log n) timeslots with a high probability, where n is the total number of nodes in the network. The constructed CDS achieves constant approximation in both density and diameter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known asymptotically optimal self-stabilizing result in terms of both density and diameter for distributed CDS construction under the practical SINR model.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Qufu Normal University", "Qufu Normal University", "Beijing Normal University", "Beijing Normal University", "George Washington University"], "authors": ["Jiguo Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jiguo", "Xueli Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Xueli", "Yunchuan Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yunchuan", "Shengling Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Shengling", "Yawei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yawei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
