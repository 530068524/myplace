However, enumerating all paths of a program is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we develop a partitioning of program paths based on the program output. Two program paths are placed in the same partition if they derive the output similarly, that is, the symbolic expression connecting the output with the inputs is the same in both paths. Our grouping of paths is gradually created by a smart path exploration. Our experiments show the benefits of the proposed pathexploration in test-suite construction.   Our path partitioning produces a semantic signature of a program --- describing all the different symbolic expressions that the output can assume along different program paths. To reason about changes between program versions, we can therefore analyze their semantic signatures. In particular, we demonstrate the applications of our path partitioning in debugging of software regressions.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Dawei Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Dawei", "Hoang D.
