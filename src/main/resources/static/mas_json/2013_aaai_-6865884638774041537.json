In this paper, we propose a novel subspace sparse coding method with utilizing label information to effectively classify the images in the subspace. Our new approach unifies the tasks of dimension reduction and supervised sparse vector learning, by simultaneously preserving the data sparse structure and meanwhile seeking the optimal projection direction in the training stage, therefore accelerates the classification process in the test stage. Our method achieves both flat and structured sparsity for the vector representations, therefore making our framework more discriminative during the subspace learning and subsequent classification. The empirical results on 4 benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Jin Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jin", "Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Heng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heng", "Chris H.
