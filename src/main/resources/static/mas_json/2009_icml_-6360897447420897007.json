The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) provides a non-parametric prior on the features present in each observation, but current inference techniques for the IBP often scale poorly. The collapsed Gibbs sampler for the IBP has a running time cubic in the number of observations, and the uncollapsed Gibbs sampler, while linear, is often slow to mix. We present a new linear-time collapsed Gibbs sampler for conjugate likelihood models and demonstrate its efficacy on large real-world datasets.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Finale Doshi-Velez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doshi=Velez:Finale", "Zoubin Ghahramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghahramani:Zoubin"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
