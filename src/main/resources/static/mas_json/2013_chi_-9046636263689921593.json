{"title": "The power of mobile notifications to increase wellbeing logging behavior.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "behavior change", "multimedia", "logging", "computer science"], "abstract": "Self-logging is a critical component to many wellbeing systems. However, self-logging often is difficult to sustain at regular intervals over many weeks. We demonstrate the power of passive mobile notifications to increase logging of wellbeing data, particularly food intake, in a mobile health service. Adding notifications increased the frequency of logging from 12% in a one-month, ten-user pilot study without reminders to 63% in the full 60-user study with reminders included. We will discuss the benefits of passive notifications over existing interruptive methods.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Motorola", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Frank Bentley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bentley:Frank", "Konrad Tollmar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tollmar:Konrad"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
