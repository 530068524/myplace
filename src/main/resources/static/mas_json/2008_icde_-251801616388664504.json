{"title": "Increasing the Expressivity of Conditional Functional Dependencies without Extra Complexity.", "fields": ["data integrity", "approximation algorithm", "pattern matching", "functional dependency", "sql"], "abstract": "The paper proposes an extension of CFDs [1], referred to as extended Conditional Functional Dependencies (eCFDs). In contrast to CFDs, eCFDs specify patterns of semantically related values in terms of disjunction and inequality, and are capable of catching inconsistencies that arise in practice but cannot be detected by CFDs. The increase in expressive power does not incur extra complexity: we show that the satisfiability and implication analyses of eCFDs remain NP - complete and coNP -complete, respectively, the same as their CFDs counterparts. In light of the intractability, we present an algorithm that approximates the maximum number of eCFDs that are satisfiable. In addition, we revise SQL techniques for detecting CFD violations, and show that violations of multiple eCFDs can be captured via a single pair of SQL queries. We also introduce an incremental SQL technique for detecting eCFD violations in response to database updates. We experimentally verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our SQL -based detection methods.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Loreto Bravo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bravo:Loreto", "Wenfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wenfei", "Floris Geerts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geerts:Floris", "Shuai Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shuai"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
