{"title": "SafeVchat: detecting obscene content and misbehaving users in online video chat services.", "fields": ["world wide web", "internet privacy", "dempster shafer theory", "computer science"], "abstract": "Online video chat services such as Chatroulette, Omegle, and vChatter that randomly match pairs of users in video chat sessions are fast becoming very popular, with over a million users per month in the case of Chatroulette. A key problem encountered in such systems is the presence of flashers and obscene content. This problem is especially acute given the presence of underage minors in such systems. This paper presents SafeVchat, a novel solution to the problem of flasher detection that employs an array of image detection algorithms. A key contribution of the paper concerns how the results of the individual detectors are fused together into an overall decision classifying the user as misbehaving or not, based on Dempster-Shafer Theory. The paper introduces a novel, motion-based skin detection method that achieves significantly higher recall and better precision. The proposed methods have been evaluated over real-world data and image traces obtained from Chatroulette.com.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "McGill University", "McGill University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Xinyu Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Xinyu", "Yu-Li Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Yu=Li", "Hanqiang Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Hanqiang", "Jianxun Dang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dang:Jianxun", "Sui Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Sui", "Richard Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Richard", "Xue Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xue", "Qin Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Qin", "Shivakant Mishra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mishra:Shivakant"], "conf": "www", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
