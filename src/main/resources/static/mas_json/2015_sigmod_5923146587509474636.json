{"title": "RBench: Application-Specific RDF Benchmarking.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "rdf schema", "cwm", "sparql", "rdf"], "abstract": "As more RDF data management systems and RDF data querying techniques emerge, RDF benchmarks providing a controllable and comparable testing environment for applications are needed. To address the needs of diverse applications, we propose an application-specific framework, called RBench, to generate RDF benchmarks. RBench takes an RDF dataset from any application as a template, and generates a set of synthetic datasets with similar characteristics including graph structure and literal labels, for the required \"size scaling factor\" and the \"degree scaling factor\". RBench analyzes several features from the given RDF dataset, and uses them to reconstruct the new benchmark graph. A flexible query load generation process is then proposed according to the design of RBench. Efficiency and usability of RBench are demonstrated via experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Case Western Reserve University", "Case Western Reserve University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Shi Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao:Shi", "Z.
