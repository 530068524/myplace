{"title": "Multi-finger chords for hand-held tablets: recognizable and memorable.", "fields": ["chord", "memorization", "vocabulary", "gesture", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Despite the demonstrated benefits of multi-finger input, todays gesture vocabularies offer a limited number of postures and gestures. Previous research designed several posture sets, but does not address the limited human capacity of retaining them. We present a multi-finger chord vocabulary, introduce a novel hand-centric approach to detect the identity of fingers on off-the-shelf hand-held tablets, and report on the detection accuracy. A between-subjects experiment comparing \"random\" to a \"categorized\" chord-command mapping found that users retained categorized mappings more accurately over one week than random ones. In response to the logical posture-language structure, people adapted to logical memorization strategies, such as 'exclusion', 'order', and 'category', to minimize the amount of information to retain. We conclude that structured chord-command mappings support learning, short-, and long-term retention of chord- command mappings.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Julie Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner:Julie", "Eric Lecolinet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lecolinet:Eric", "Ted Selker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Selker:Ted"], "pages": 10}
