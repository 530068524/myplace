{"title": "Variational Autoencoder for Deep Learning of Images, Labels and Captions.", "fields": ["convolutional neural network", "encoder", "autoencoder", "recurrent neural network", "deep learning"], "abstract": "A novel variational autoencoder is developed to model images, as well as associated labels or captions. The Deep Generative Deconvolutional Network (DGDN) is used as a decoder of the latent image features, and a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as an image encoder; the CNN is used to approximate a distribution for the latent DGDN features/code. The latent code is also linked to generative models for labels (Bayesian support vector machine) or captions (recurrent neural network). When predicting a label/caption for a new image at test, averaging is performed across the distribution of latent codes; this is computationally efficient as a consequence of the learned CNN-based encoder. Since the framework is capable of modeling the image in the presence/absence of associated labels/captions, a new semi-supervised setting is manifested for CNN learning with images; the framework even allows unsupervised CNN learning, based on images alone.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Yunchen Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Yunchen", "Zhe Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Zhe", "Ricardo Henao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henao:Ricardo", "Xin Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan_0002:Xin", "Chunyuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chunyuan", "Andrew Stevens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stevens:Andrew", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
