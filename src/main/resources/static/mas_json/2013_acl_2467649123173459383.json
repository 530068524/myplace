In the first stage, we propose a Sentiment Graph Walking algorithm, which naturally incorporates syntactic patterns in a Sentiment Graph to extract opinion word/target candidates. Then random walking is employed to estimate confidence of candidates, which improves extraction accuracy by considering confidence of patterns. In the second stage, we adopt a self-learning strategy to refine the results from the first stage, especially for filtering out high-frequency noise terms and capturing the long-tail terms, which are not investigated by previous methods. The experimental results on three real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with stateof-the-art unsupervised methods.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Liheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Liheng", "Kang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Kang", "Siwei Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Siwei", "Yubo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Yubo", "Jun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Jun"], "pages": 10}
