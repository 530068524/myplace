We show that all languages with a neutral letter, definable using the addition predicate are also definable with the order predicate as the only numerical predicate. Let S be a subset of monoids. Let L be the logic closed under quantification over the monoids in S. Then we prove that L[", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Wilhelm-Schicka ... bingen, Germany", "Inst. of Math.  ...
