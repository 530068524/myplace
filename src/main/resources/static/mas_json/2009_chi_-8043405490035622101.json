We focus particularly on new approaches to and understandings of ethnography that have emerged as the computer has moved out of the workplace. These seek to implement a different order of ethnographic study to that which has largely been employed in design to date. In doing so they reconfigure the relationship ethnography has to systems design, replacing detailed empirical studies of situated action with studies that provide cultural interpretations of action and critiques of the design process itself. We hold these new approaches to and understandings of ethnography in design up to scrutiny, with the purpose of enabling designers to appreciate the differences between new and existing approaches to ethnography in systems design and the practical implications this might have for design.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "Sheffield Hallam University", "Aalborg University", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "instituto de f\u00ed ...
