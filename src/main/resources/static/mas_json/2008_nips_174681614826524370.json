{"title": "Convergence and Rate of Convergence of a Manifold-Based Dimension Reduction Algorithm.", "fields": ["modes of convergence", "normal convergence", "convergence tests", "invariant subspace", "compact convergence"], "abstract": "We study the convergence and the rate of convergence of a local manifold learning algorithm: LTSA [13]. The main technical tool is the perturbation analysis on the linear invariant subspace that corresponds to the solution of LTSA. We derive a worst-case upper bound of errors for LTSA which naturally leads to a convergence result. We then derive the rate of convergence for LTSA in a special case.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Andrew Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Andrew", "Xiaoming Huo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huo:Xiaoming", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan"], "pages": 8}
