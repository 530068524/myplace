{"title": "Joint POS Tagging and Text Normalization for Informal Text.", "fields": ["viterbi decoder", "data set", "security token", "text normalization", "normalization"], "abstract": "Text normalization and part-of-speech (POS) tagging for social media data have been investigated recently, however, prior work has treated them separately. In this paper, we propose a joint Viterbi decoding process to determine each token's POS tag and non-standard token's correct form at the same time. In order to evaluate our approach, we create two new data sets with POS tag labels and non-standard tokens' correct forms. This is the first data set with such annotation. The experiment results demonstrate the effect of non-standard words on POS tagging, and also show that our proposed methods perform better than the state-of-theart systems in both POS tagging and normalization.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Chen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0013:Chen", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0004:Yang"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
