{"title": "Learning with Marginalized Corrupted Features and Labels Together.", "fields": ["data set", "exploit", "autoencoder", "shared resource", "web application"], "abstract": "Tagging has become increasingly important in many real-world applications noticeably including web applications, such as web blogs and resource sharing systems. Despite this importance, tagging methods often face difficult challenges such as limited training samples and incomplete labels, which usually lead to degenerated performance on tag prediction. To improve the generalization performance, in this paper, we propose Regularized Marginalized Cross-View learning (RMCV) by jointly modeling on attribute noise and label noise. In more details, the proposed model constructs infinite training examples with attribute noises from known exponential-family distributions and exploits label noise via marginalized denoising autoencoder. Therefore, the model benefits from its robustness and alleviates the problem of tag sparsity. While RMCV is a general method for learning tagging, in the evaluations we focus on the specific application of multi-label text tagging. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that RMCV outstands with a superior performance in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Binghamton University", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Binghamton University"], "authors": ["Yingming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingming", "Ming Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ming", "Zenglin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zenglin", "Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongfei_=Mark="], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
