Our approach provably obtains the fastest linear convergence rate that can be verified by a quadratic Lyapunov function (with given states), and only relies on solving a small-sized semidefinite program. Our approach combines the advantages of performance estimation problems (PEP, due to Drori & Teboulle (2014)) and integral quadratic constraints (IQC, due to Lessard et al. (2016)), and relies on convex interpolation (due to Taylor et al. (2017c;b)).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Adrien Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Adrien", "Bryan Van Scoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scoy:Bryan_Van", "Laurent Lessard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lessard:Laurent"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
