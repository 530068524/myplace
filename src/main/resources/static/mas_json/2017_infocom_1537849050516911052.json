More and more images are being generated and stored in public clouds. However, recent photo leakage events raise concerns about privacy leaks for images stored in public clouds. In this paper, we present an efficient scalable hierarchical image retrieval system (CASHEIRS) which provides privacy-aware image retrieval feature. CASHEIRS employs transformed Convolutional Neural Network features to improve image retrieval accuracy and an encrypted hierarchical index tree to speed up the query process. Extensive evaluations using Caltech256 and INRIA Holiday datasets show that CASHEIRS is more effective than three existing schemes. We also demonstrate its practicality on a mobile device.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Lehigh University", "Lehigh University", "Lehigh University"], "authors": ["Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xin", "Qinghan Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Qinghan", "Mooi Choo Chuah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuah:Mooi_Choo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
