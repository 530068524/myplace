The tool is based on an information retrieval technique, namely latent semantic indexing, and aims at supporting the software engineer in the identification of traceability links between artefacts of different types. The tool has also been integrated in the Eclipse-based client of ADAMS.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["University of Salerno", "University of Salerno", "University of Salerno"], "authors": ["Andrea De Lucia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucia:Andrea_De", "Rocco Oliveto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveto:Rocco", "Genoveffa Tortora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tortora:Genoveffa"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
