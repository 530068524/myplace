However, the best methods, such as those based on kernel-SVMs are highly computationally intensive. The problem of how to accelerate the evaluation process without decreasing accuracy is thus of current interest. In this paper, we deal with this problem by using the idea of ranking. We propose a cascaded architecture which using the ranking SVM generates an ordered set of proposals for windows containing object instances. The top ranking windows may then be fed to a more complex detector. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is robust, achieving higher overlap-recall values using fewer output proposals than the state-of-the-art. Our use of simple gradient features and linear convolution indicates that our method is also faster than the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Oxford Brookes University", "Oxford Brookes University", "Oxford Brookes University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ziming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ziming", "Jonathan Warrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Warrell:Jonathan", "Philip H.
