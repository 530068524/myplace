We conducted 13 semi-structured interviews as part of a qualitative study of Google Calendar users. Our research discovered how participants develop understandings of how close friends and significant others structure their time using shared calendars, as well as how people negotiate and enact accounts within and beyond their intimate relationships. Our findings indicate ways in which Online Calendar Systems (OCS) can be better designed to more effectively support users' needs.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Northwestern University", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Alexander Thayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thayer:Alexander", "Behzod Sirjani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sirjani:Behzod", "Charlotte P.
