However, continuous emission of scents creates problems of olfactory adaptations and scents lingering in the air. To overcome these problems, we developed an ink-jet olfactory display. This display has high emission control so that it can provide stable pulse emission of scents. Humans detect the scents when they breathe in and inhale scents molecules in the air. Therefore, it is important to synchronize the pulse ejection of scent presentation with the inspiration. With that, by using the pulse ejection of scents, we constructed the pulse ejection pattern what enables instantaneous switch of scents. We first measured the responding time to sense the shift of scents in order to achieve the pulse ejection pattern suited for switching the scents. Then, by using the pattern found in first experiment, we measured the shortest period of scent switching. At last, we measured the limit of switching scents. As a result, we constructed the presenting pattern of scent switching and the limit of scent switching when the scent switching was presented with its shortest period. It is expected that using this developed pattern with movies would raise the realistic sensations.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University", "Canon Inc.", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Sayumi Sugimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugimoto:Sayumi", "Daisuke Noguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noguchi:Daisuke", "Yuichi Bannai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bannai:Yuichi", "Ken-ichi Okada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okada:Ken=ichi"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
