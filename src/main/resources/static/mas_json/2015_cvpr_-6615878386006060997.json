This issue raises a serious problem for conventional approaches. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a multi-context deep learning framework for salient object detection. We employ deep Convolutional Neural Networks to model saliency of objects in images. Global context and local context are both taken into account, and are jointly modeled in a unified multi-context deep learning framework. To provide a better initialization for training the deep neural networks, we investigate different pre-training strategies, and a task-specific pre-training scheme is designed to make the multi-context modeling suited for saliency detection. Furthermore, recently proposed contemporary deep models in the ImageNet Image Classification Challenge are tested, and their effectiveness in saliency detection are investigated. Our approach is extensively evaluated on five public datasets, and experimental results show significant and consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (342)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Rui Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Rui", "Wanli Ouyang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouyang:Wanli", "Hongsheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongsheng", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang"], "pages": 10}
