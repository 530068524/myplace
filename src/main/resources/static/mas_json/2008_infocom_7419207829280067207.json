The data fusion technique is a key component of DSS. We discuss the Byzantine failure problem in the context of data fusion, which may be caused by either malfunctioning sensing terminals or Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) attacks. In either case, incorrect spectrum sensing data will be reported to a data collector which can lead to the distortion of data fusion outputs. We investigate various data fusion techniques, focusing on their robustness against Byzantine failures. In contrast to existing data fusion techniques that use a fixed number of samples, we propose a new technique that uses a variable number of samples. The proposed technique, which we call Weighted Sequential Probability Ratio Test (WSPRT), introduces a reputation-based mechanism to the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). We evaluate WSPRT by comparing it with a variety of data fusion techniques under various network operating conditions. Our simulation results indicate that WSPRT is the most robust against the Byzantine failure problem among the data fusion techniques that were considered.", "citation": "Citations (578)", "departments": ["Virginia Polyte ... iv., Blacksburg", "Virginia Polyte ... iv., Blacksburg", "Virginia Polyte ... iv., Blacksburg"], "authors": ["Ruiliang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ruiliang", "Jung-Min Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park_0001:Jung=Min", "Kaigui Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Kaigui"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
