So far the best known on-line algorithm of Kier stead used at most $(5^w-1)/4$ chains, on the other hand Szemer\\'{e}di proved that any on-line algorithm requires at least $\\binom{w+1}{2}$ chains. These results were obtained in the early eighties and since then no progress in the general case has been done. We provide an on-line algorithm that partitions orders of width $w$ into at most $w^{16\\log{w}}$ chains. This yields the first sub-exponential upper bound for on-line chain partitioning problem.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Jagiellonian University", "Jagiellonian University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Bartlomiej Bosek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosek:Bartlomiej", "Tomasz Krawczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krawczyk:Tomasz"], "pages": 8}
