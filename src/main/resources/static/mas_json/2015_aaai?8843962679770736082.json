{"title": "Word Segmentation for Chinese Novels.", "fields": ["noun", "retraining", "text segmentation", "proper noun", "parsing"], "abstract": "Word segmentation is a necessary first step for automatic syntactic analysis of Chinese text. Chinese segmentation is highly accurate on news data, but the accuracies drop significantly on other domains, such as science and literature. For scientific domains, a significant portion of out-of-vocabulary words are domain-specific terms, and therefore lexicons can be used to improve segmentation significantly. For the literature domain, however, there is not a fixed set of domain terms. For example, each novel can contain a specific set of person, organization and location names. We investigate a method for automatically mining common noun entities for each novel using information extraction techniques, and use the resulting entities to improve a state-of-the-art segmentation model for the novel. In particular, we design a novel double-propagation algorithm that mines noun entities together with common contextual patterns, and use them as plug-in features to a model trained on the source domain. An advantage of our method is that no retraining for the segmentation model is needed for each novel, and hence it can be applied efficiently given the huge number of novels on the web. Results on five different novels show significantly improved accuracies, in particular for OOV words.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design"], "authors": ["Likun Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Likun", "Yue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yue"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
