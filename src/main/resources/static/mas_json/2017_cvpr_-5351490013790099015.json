{"title": "ScanNet: Richly-Annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes.", "fields": ["deep learning", "solid modeling", "annotation", "scalability", "voxel"], "abstract": "A key requirement for leveraging supervised deep learning methods is the availability of large, labeled datasets. Unfortunately, in the context of RGB-D scene understanding, very little data is available \u2013 current datasets cover a small range of scene views and have limited semantic annotations. To address this issue, we introduce ScanNet, an RGB-D video dataset containing 2.5M views in 1513 scenes annotated with 3D camera poses, surface reconstructions, and semantic segmentations. To collect this data, we designed an easy-to-use and scalable RGB-D capture system that includes automated surface reconstruction and crowdsourced semantic annotation. We show that using this data helps achieve state-of-the-art performance on several 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D object classification, semantic voxel labeling, and CAD model retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Angela Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Angela", "Angel X.
