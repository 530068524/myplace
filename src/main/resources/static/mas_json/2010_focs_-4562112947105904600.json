We wish to route flow from a set of demand nodes to a root node, where the cost of routing x total flow along an edge is proportional to f(x) for some concave, non-decreasing function f satisfying f(0)=0. We present a simple, fast, combinatorial algorithm that takes a set of demands and constructs a single tree T such that for all f the cost f(T) is a 47.45-approximation of the optimal cost for that f. This is within a factor of 2.33 of the best approximation ratio currently achievable when the tree can be optimized for a specific function. Trees achieving simultaneous O(1)-approximations for all concave functions were previously not known to exist regardless of computation time.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Ashish Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Ashish", "Ian Post.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Post:Ian"], "pages": 8}
