This follows from the more general result: \"There is an elementary function f such that if a#x03C6; is a cut-free LK proof of A a#x22A2; with symbol complexity a#x2264; c, then there exists a cut-free LJ proof of A a#x22A2; with symbol complexity a#x2264; f(c)\". The result is proved using a suitable variant of cut-elimination by resolution (CERES) and subsumption.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Matthias Baaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baaz:Matthias", "Alexander Leitsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leitsch:Alexander", "Giselle Reis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reis:Giselle"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
