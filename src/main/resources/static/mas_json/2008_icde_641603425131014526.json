Active XML (AXML, in short) language is a tool for decentralized, data-centric Web service integration. AXML document includes calls to services that may be either simple request-responses either long running subscriptions. Being fully composable and allowing resource sharing makes AXML ideal for mash-up style integration. In this demo we present how AXML can be used as a specification, optimization and distributed execution language for dynamic distributed mash-ups in varied P2P settings. We also demonstrate our AXML optimizer's (OptimAX) optimization rules and rewriting engine with a help of GUI.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Serge Abiteboul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abiteboul:Serge", "Ioana Manolescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manolescu:Ioana", "Spyros Zoupanos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zoupanos:Spyros"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
