{"title": "EWCDM: An Efficient, Beyond-Birthday Secure, Nonce-Misuse Resistant MAC.", "fields": ["random function", "cryptographic nonce", "block cipher", "mdc 2", "permutation"], "abstract": "We propose a nonce-based MAC construction called EWCDM Encrypted Wegman-Carter with Davies-Meyer, based on an almost xor-universal hash function and a block cipher, with the following properties: i it is simple and efficient, requiring only two calls to the block cipher, one of which can be carried out in parallel to the hash function computation; ii it is provably secure beyond the birthday bound when nonces are not reused; iii it provably retains security upi\u00be?to the birthday bound in case of nonce misuse. Our construction is a simple modification of the Encrypted Wegman-Carter construction, which is known to achieve only i and iii when based on a block cipher. Underlying our new construction is a new PRP-to-PRF conversion method coined Encrypted Davies-Meyer, which turns a pair of secret random permutations into a function which is provably indistinguishable from a perfectly random function upi\u00be?to at least $$2^{2n/3}$$ queries, where n is the bit-length of the domain of the permutations.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of V ... ailles, France", "ANSSI, Paris, France"], "authors": ["Beno\u00eet Cogliati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cogliati:Beno=icirc=t", "Yannick Seurin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seurin:Yannick"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2016", "pages": 29}
