{"title": "Protecting Data on Smartphones and Tablets from Memory Attacks.", "fields": ["dma attack", "nexus", "cache", "memory bus", "reboot"], "abstract": "Smartphones and tablets are easily lost or stolen. This makes them susceptible to an inexpensive class of memory attacks, such as cold-boot attacks, using a bus monitor to observe the memory bus, and DMA attacks. This paper describes Sentry, a system that allows applications and OS components to store their code and data on the System-on-Chip (SoC) rather than in DRAM. We use ARM-specific mechanisms originally designed for embedded systems, but still present in today's mobile devices, to protect applications and OS subsystems from memory attacks.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Patrick Colp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colp:Patrick", "Jiawen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jiawen", "James Gleeson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gleeson:James", "Sahil Suneja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suneja:Sahil", "Eyal de Lara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lara:Eyal_de", "Himanshu Raj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raj:Himanshu", "Stefan Saroiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saroiu:Stefan", "Alec Wolman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolman:Alec"], "pages": 13}
