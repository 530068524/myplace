{"title": "A Non-generative Framework and Convex Relaxations for Unsupervised Learning.", "fields": ["performance metric", "regular polygon", "generative grammar", "probabilistic logic", "generative model"], "abstract": "We give a novel formal theoretical framework for unsupervised learning with two distinctive characteristics. First, it does not assume any generative model and based on a worst-case performance metric. Second, it is comparative, namely performance is measured with respect to a given hypothesis class. This allows to avoid known computational hardness results and improper algorithms based on convex relaxations. We show how several families of unsupervised learning models, which were previously only analyzed under probabilistic assumptions and are otherwise provably intractable, can be efficiently learned in our framework by convex optimization.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad", "Tengyu Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Tengyu"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
