In order to utilize all kinds of characteristics in web video such as visual features (SIFT, shape or color) and contextual cues (such as title or tags) effectively, this paper proposes an approach to represent the explicit and implicit correlations hidden in web videos by a star-structured K-partite graph model, and then a co-clustering process is conducted to discover video topics. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Jian Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Jian", "Wentao Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Wentao", "Shuai Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shuai", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
