The proposed algorithm features probabilistic interpretation, efficient updating rules and flexible modulation on whether learners focus on their specific task or on jointly address all tasks. The paper also proves a sub-linear regret bound as compared to the best linear predictor in hindsight. Experiments over three multi-task learning benchmark datasets show advantageous performance of the proposed approach over several state-of-the-art online multi-task learning baselines.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Keerthiram Murugesan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murugesan:Keerthiram", "Hanxiao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hanxiao", "Jaime G.
