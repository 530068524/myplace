But account and device sharing situations (when 2+ people use a single device or account) may arise during everyday life. We present results from a multiple-methods study of device and account sharing practices among household members and their relations. Among our findings are that device and account sharing was common, and mobile phones were often shared despite being considered \"personal\" devices. Based on our study results, we organize sharing practices into a taxonomy of six sharing types--distinct patterns of what, why, and how people shared. We also present two themes that cut across sharing types: that (1) trust in sharees and (2) convenience highly influenced sharing practices. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for study and technology design.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tara Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Tara", "Kerwell Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Kerwell", "Anna Turner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turner:Anna", "Marianne Berkovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berkovich:Marianne", "Robert W.
