Does the strength of influence remain periodic or decay exponentially over time? In this paper, we study these critical questions in social network analysis quantitatively under the framework of multi-dimensional Hawkes processes. In particular, we focus on the nonparametric learning of the triggering kernels, and propose an algorithm MMEL that combines the idea of decoupling the parameters through constructing a tight upper-bound of the objective function and application of Euler-Lagrange equations for optimization in infinite dimensional functional space. We show that the proposed method performs significantly better than alternatives in experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ke Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0002:Ke", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
