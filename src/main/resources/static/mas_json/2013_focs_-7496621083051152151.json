{"title": "Approximating Bin Packing within O(log OPT * Log Log OPT) Bins.", "fields": ["linear programming relaxation", "rounding", "bin packing problem", "log log plot", "approximation algorithm"], "abstract": "For bin packing, the input consists of n items with sizes between 0 and 1, which have to be assigned to a minimum number of bins of size 1. The seminal Karmarkar-Karp algorithm from '82 produces a solution with at most OPT + O(log 2  OPT) bins. We provide the first improvement in now 3 decades and show that one can find a solution of cost OPT + O(log OPT * log log OPT) in polynomial time. This is achieved by rounding a fractional solution to the Gilmore-Gomory LP relaxation using the Entropy Method from discrepancy theory. The result is constructive via algorithms of Bansal and Lovett-Meka.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Thomas Rothvo\u00df.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rothvo=szlig=:Thomas"], "pages": 10}
