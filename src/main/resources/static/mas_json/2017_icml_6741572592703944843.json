{"title": "Pain-Free Random Differential Privacy with Sensitivity Sampling.", "fields": ["bounded function", "exponential function", "laplace transform", "smoothing", "differential privacy"], "abstract": "Popular approaches to differential privacy, such as the Laplace and exponential mechanisms, calibrate randomised smoothing through global sensitivity of the target non-private function. Bounding such sensitivity is often a prohibitively complex analytic calculation. As an alternative, we propose a straightforward sampler for estimating sensitivity of non-private mechanisms. Since our sensitivity estimates hold with high probability, any mechanism that would be $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differentially private under bounded global sensitivity automatically achieves $(\\epsilon,\\delta,\\gamma)$-random differential privacy (Hall et al., 2012), without any target-specific calculations required. We demonstrate on worked example learners how our usable approach adopts a naturally-relaxed privacy guarantee, while achieving more accurate releases even for non-private functions that are black-box computer programs.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "Ruhr University Bochum"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Benjamin I.
