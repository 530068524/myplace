However, our understanding of this critical behavior is quite limited, and the literature lacks any quantitative study concerning its true value. In this paper we present a methodology for measuring the conversion rate of spam. Using a parasitic infiltration of an existing botnet's infrastructure, we analyze two spam campaigns: one designed to propagate a malware Trojan, the other marketing on-line pharmaceuticals. For nearly a half billion spam e-mails we identify the number that are successfully delivered, the number that pass through popular anti-spam filters, the number that elicit user visits to the advertised sites, and the number of \"sales\" and \"infections\" produced.", "citation": "Citations (483)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "International Computer Science Institute", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "International Computer Science Institute", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Chris Kanich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanich:Chris", "Christian Kreibich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kreibich:Christian", "Kirill Levchenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levchenko:Kirill", "Brandon Enright.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Enright:Brandon", "Geoffrey M.
