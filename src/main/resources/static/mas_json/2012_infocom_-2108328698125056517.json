{"title": "NSDMiner: Automated discovery of Network Service Dependencies.", "fields": ["network management station", "service discovery", "enterprise private network", "intelligent computer network", "network traffic control"], "abstract": "Enterprise networks today host a wide variety of network services, which often depend on each other to provide and support network-based services and applications. Understanding such dependencies is essential for maintaining the well-being of an enterprise network and its applications, particularly in the presence of network attacks and failures. In a typical enterprise network, which is complex and dynamic in configuration, it is non-trivial to identify all these services and their dependencies. Several techniques have been developed to learn such dependencies automatically. However, they are either too complex to fine tune or cluttered with false positives and/or false negatives. In this paper, we propose a suite of novel techniques and develop a new tool named NSDMiner (which stands for Mining for Network Service Dependencies) to automatically discover the dependencies between network services from passively collected network traffic. NSDMiner is non-intrusive; it does not require any modification of existing software, or injection of network packets. More importantly, NSDMiner achieves higher accuracy than previous network-based approaches. Our experimental evaluation, which uses network traffic collected from our campus network, shows that NSDMiner outperforms the two best existing solutions significantly.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "George Mason University", "ICF Jacob and S ... , MD 21202, USA"], "authors": ["Arun Natarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Natarajan:Arun", "Peng Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Peng", "Yao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0007:Yao", "Sushil Jajodia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jajodia:Sushil", "Steve E.
