As a discrete approximation of the data manifold, the graph plays a crucial role in the success of such graph-based methods. In most existing methods, graph construction makes use of a predefined weighting function without utilizing label information even when it is available. In this work, by incorporating label information, we seek to enhance the performance of graph-based semi-supervised learning by learning the graph and label inference simultaneously. In particular, we consider a particular setting of semi-supervised learning called transductive learning. Using the LogDet divergence to define the objective function, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problem which has closed-form solution in each step. We perform experiments on both synthetic and real data to demonstrate improvement in the graph and in terms of classification accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Yan-Ming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yan=Ming", "Yu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Yu", "Dit-Yan Yeung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeung:Dit=Yan", "Cheng-Lin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Cheng=Lin", "Xinwen Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Xinwen"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
