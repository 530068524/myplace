For example, physiological measures such as heart rate (HR) can provide high-resolution data about the physical, emotional, and mental state of the participant. We investigate and characterize the feasibility of gathering HR from videos of online participants engaged in single user and social tasks. We show that room lighting, head motion, and network bandwidth influence measurement quality, but that instructing participants in good practices substantially improves measurement quality. Our work takes a step towards online physiological data collection.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Thomas Muender.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muender:Thomas", "Matthew K.
