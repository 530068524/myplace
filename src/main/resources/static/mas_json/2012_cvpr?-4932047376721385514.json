{"title": "A unifying resolution-independent formulation for early vision.", "fields": ["prior probability", "invariant", "energy functional", "generalization", "deblurring"], "abstract": "We present a model for early vision tasks such as denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and demosaicing. The model provides a resolution-independent representation of discrete images which admits a truly rotationally invariant prior. The model generalizes several existing approaches: variational methods, finite element methods, and discrete random fields. The primary contribution is a novel energy functional which has not previously been written down, which combines the discrete measurements from pixels with a continuous-domain world viewed through continous-domain point-spread functions. The value of the functional is that simple priors (such as total variation and generalizations) on the continous-domain world become realistic priors on the sampled images. We show that despite its apparent complexity, optimization of this model depends on just a few computational primitives, which although tedious to derive, can now be reused in many domains. We define a set of optimization algorithms which greatly overcome the apparent complexity of this model, and make possible its practical application. New experimental results include infinite-resolution upsampling, and a method for obtaining \u201csubpixel superpixels\u201d.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Microsoft", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Fabio Viola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viola:Fabio", "Andrew W.
