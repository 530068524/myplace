As an unparalleled stage for an enormous audience, they offer fast and reliable centralized diffusion of pithy tweets to great multitudes of information-hungry and always-connected followers. At the same time, this information gathering and dissemination paradigm prompts some important privacy concerns about relationships between tweeters, followers and interests of the latter. In this paper, we assess privacy in today's Twitter-like OSNs and describe an architecture and a trial implementation of a privacy-preserving service called Hummingbird. It is essentially a variant of Twitter that protects tweet contents, hash tags and follower interests from the (potentially) prying eyes of the centralized server. We argue that, although inherently limited by Twitter's mission of scalable information-sharing, this degree of privacy is valuable. We demonstrate, via a working prototype, that Hummingbird's additional costs are tolerably low. We also sketch out some viable enhancements that might offer better privacy in the long term.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "PARC"], "authors": ["Emiliano De Cristofaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cristofaro:Emiliano_De", "Claudio Soriente.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soriente:Claudio", "Gene Tsudik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsudik:Gene", "Andrew Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Andrew"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2012", "pages": 15}
