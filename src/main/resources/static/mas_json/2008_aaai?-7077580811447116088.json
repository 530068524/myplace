In a sequence of recent papers, we have shown that an effective means to reason with such specifications is to decompose them into primitive constraints (Quimper & Walsh 2006; 2007). We can then, for instance, use state of the art SAT solvers and profit from their advanced features like fast unit propagation, clause learning, and conflict-based search heuristics. This approach holds promise for solving combinatorial problems in scheduling, rostering, and configuration, as well as problems in more diverse areas like bioinformatics, software testing and natural language processing. In addition, decomposition may be an effective method to propagate other global constraints.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al", "NICTA"], "authors": ["Claude-Guy Quimper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quimper:Claude=Guy", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
