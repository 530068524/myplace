{"title": "On Matching Pursuit and Coordinate Descent.", "fields": ["affine transformation", "regular polygon", "coordinate descent", "sublinear function", "matching pursuit"], "abstract": "Two popular examples of first-order optimization methods over linear spaces are coordinate descent and matching pursuit algorithms, with their randomized variants. While the former targets the optimization by moving along coordinates, the latter considers a generalized notion of directions. Exploiting the connection between the two algorithms, we present a unified analysis of both, providing affine invariant sublinear $\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rates on smooth objectives and linear convergence on strongly convex objectives. As a byproduct of our affine invariant analysis of matching pursuit, our rates for steepest coordinate descent are the tightest known. Furthermore, we show the first accelerated convergence rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/t^2)$ for matching pursuit and steepest coordinate descent on convex objectives.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "ETH Zurich", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Francesco Locatello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Locatello:Francesco", "Anant Raj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raj:Anant", "Sai Praneeth Karimireddy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karimireddy:Sai_Praneeth", "Gunnar R\u00e4tsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=tsch:Gunnar", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard", "Sebastian U.
