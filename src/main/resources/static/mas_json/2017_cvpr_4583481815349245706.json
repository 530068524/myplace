{"title": "Low-Rank-Sparse Subspace Representation for Robust Regression.", "fields": ["robust regression", "polynomial regression", "proper linear model", "support vector machine", "gaussian noise"], "abstract": "Learning robust regression model from high-dimensional corrupted data is an essential and difficult problem in many practical applications. The state-of-the-art methods have studied low-rank regression models that are robust against typical noises (like Gaussian noise and out-sample sparse noise) or outliers, such that a regression model can be learned from clean data lying on underlying subspaces. However, few of the existing low-rank regression methods can handle the outliers/noise lying on the sparsely corrupted disjoint subspaces. To address this issue, we propose a low-rank-sparse subspace representation for robust regression, hereafter referred to as LRS-RR in this paper. The main contribution include the following: (1) Unlike most of the existing regression methods, we propose an approach with two phases of low-rank-sparse subspace recovery and regression optimization being carried out simultaneously,(2) we also apply the linearized alternating direction method with adaptive penalty to solved the formulated LRS-RR problem and prove the convergence of the algorithm and analyze its complexity, (3) we demonstrate the efficiency of our method for the high-dimensional corrupted data on both synthetic data and two benchmark datasets against several state-of-the-art robust methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Shenzhen University", "University of Sydney", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yongqiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Yongqiang", "Daming Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi_0001:Daming", "Junbin Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Junbin", "Dansong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Dansong"], "pages": 10}
