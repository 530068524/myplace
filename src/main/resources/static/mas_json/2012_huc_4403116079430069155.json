Recently, many related works address to detect real world events from social media such as Twitter. However, geotagged tweets often contain noise, which means tweets which are not content-wise related to users' location. This noise is problem for detecting real world events. To address and solve the problem, we define the  Place-Triggered Geotagged Tweet , meaning tweets which have both geotag and content-based relation to users' location. We designed and implemented a keyword-based matching technique to detect and classify place-triggered geotagged tweets. We evaluated the performance of our method against a ground truth provided by 18 human classifiers, and achieved 82% accuracy. Additionally, we also present two example applications for visualizing place-triggered geotagged tweets.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University", "University of Oulu", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Shinya Hiruta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hiruta:Shinya", "Takuro Yonezawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yonezawa:Takuro", "Marko Jurmu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurmu:Marko", "Hideyuki Tokuda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tokuda:Hideyuki"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 8}
