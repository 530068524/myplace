{"title": "Envy-Free Division of Sellable Goods.", "fields": ["microeconomics", "fair division", "social welfare", "envy free", "computational social choice"], "abstract": "We study the envy-free allocation of indivisible goods between two players. Our novel setting includes an option to sell each good for a fraction of the minimum value any player has for the good. To rigorously quantify the efficiency gain from selling, we reason about the price of envy-freeness of allocations of sellable goods--the ratio between the maximum social welfare and the social welfare of the best envy-free allocation. We show that envy-free allocations of sellable goods are significantly more efficient than their unsellable counterparts.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Jeremy Karp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karp:Jeremy", "Aleksandr M.
