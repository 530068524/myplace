This device is called a multi-sensorial field (MSF) display. When two fans are placed facing each other, the airflows generated by them collide with each other and are radially deflected on a plane perpendicular to the original airflow direction. By utilizing the deflected airflow, the MSF display can present the airflow blowing from the front to the user without placing fans in front of the user. The directivity of the airflow deflection can be controlled by placing nozzles on the fans to adjust the cross-sectional shape of the airflow jets coming from the fans. The MSF display can also generate odor-concentration distribution in a real environment by introducing odor vapors into the airflow generated by the fans. The user can freely move his/her head and sniff at various locations in the generated odor distribution. The results of preliminary sensory tests are presented to show the potential of the MSF display.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology", "Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology", "Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"], "authors": ["Haruka Matsukura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsukura:Haruka", "Tomohiko Nihei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nihei:Tomohiko", "Hiroshi Ishida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishida:Hiroshi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
