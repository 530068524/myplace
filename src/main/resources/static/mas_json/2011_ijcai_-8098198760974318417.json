Techniques solving MinSAT are substantially different from those for the Maximum Satisfiability Problem (MaxSAT). Our results provide empirical evidence that solving combinatorial optimization problems by reducing them to MinSAT may be substantially faster than reducing them to MaxSAT, and even competitive with specific algorithms. We also use MinSAT to study an interesting correlation between the minimum number and the maximum number of satisfied clauses of a SAT instance.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "University of Picardie Jules Verne", "Spanish National Research Council", "University of Paris"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Chu Min Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chu_Min", "Zhu Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Zhu", "Felip Many\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Many=agrave=:Felip", "Laurent Simon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simon:Laurent"], "pages": 6}
