{"title": "Evaluation Probes.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "emic and etic", "experiential learning", "computer science"], "abstract": "We introduce evaluation probes for conducting emic, experiential evaluation of urban technologies \"in the wild\" without direct researcher presence. We commence with a thorough discussion and analysis of the original cultural probes, used by Gaver, Dunne and Pacenti to gain design inspiration, and their subsequent variations. We develop the concept of evaluation probes through careful re-conceptualization and application of the cultural probes in three successive studies conducted in the wild. We recount and reflect on our use of evaluation probes and discuss their merits and limitations in experiential emic evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Anna Luusua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luusua:Anna", "Johanna Ylipulli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ylipulli:Johanna", "Marko Jurmu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurmu:Marko", "Henrika Pihlajaniemi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pihlajaniemi:Henrika", "Piia Markkanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markkanen:Piia", "Timo Ojala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ojala:Timo"], "pages": 10}
