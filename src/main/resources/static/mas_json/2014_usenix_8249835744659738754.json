{"title": "In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm.", "fields": ["raft", "distributed computing", "leader election", "paxos", "algorithm"], "abstract": "Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.", "citation": "Citations (613)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Diego Ongaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ongaro:Diego", "John K.
