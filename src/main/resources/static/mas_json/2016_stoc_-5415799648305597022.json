{"title": "A deterministic almost-tight distributed algorithm for approximating single-source shortest paths.", "fields": ["deterministic system", "binary logarithm", "streaming algorithm", "deterministic algorithm", "distributed algorithm"], "abstract": "We present a deterministic (1+ o (1))-approximation  O ( n  1/2+ o (1) + D  1+ o (1) )-time algorithm for solving the single-source shortest paths problem on distributed weighted networks (the CONGEST model); here  n  is the number of nodes in the network and  D  is its (hop) diameter. This is the first non-trivial deterministic algorithm for this problem. It also improves (i) the running time of the randomized (1+ o (1))-approximation O( n  1/2  D  1/4 + D )-time algorithm of Nanongkai [STOC 2014] by a factor of as large as  n  1/8 , and (ii) the  O (\u0454 \u22121 log\u0454 \u22121 )-approximation factor of Lenzen and Patt-Shamir\u2019s O( n  1/2+\u0454 + D )-time algorithm [STOC 2013] within the same running time. Our running time matches the known time lower bound of \u03a9( n  1/2 /log n  +  D ) [Das Sarma et al. STOC 2011] modulo some lower-order terms, thus essentially settling the status of this problem which was raised at least a decade ago [Elkin SIGACT News 2004]. It also implies a (2+ o (1))-approximation  O ( n  1/2+ o (1) + D  1+ o (1) )-time algorithm for approximating a network\u2019s weighted diameter which almost matches the lower bound by Holzer et al. [PODC 2012].   In achieving this result, we develop two techniques which might be of independent interest and useful in other settings: (i) a deterministic process that replaces the \u201chitting set argument\u201d commonly used for shortest paths computation in various settings, and (ii) a simple, deterministic, construction of an ( n   o (1) ,  o (1)) -hop set  of size  O ( n  1+ o (1) ). We combine these techniques with many distributed algorithmic techniques, some of which from problems that are not directly related to shortest paths, e.g. ruling sets [Goldberg et al. STOC 1987], source detection [Lenzen, Peleg PODC 2013], and partial distance estimation [Lenzen, Patt-Shamir PODC 2015]. Our hop set construction also leads to single-source shortest paths algorithms in two other settings: (i) a (1+ o (1))-approximation  O ( n   o (1) )-time algorithm on  congested cliques , and (ii) a (1+ o (1))-approximation  O ( n   o (1) log W )-pass  O ( n  1+ o (1) log W )-space  streaming  algorithm, when edge weights are in {1, 2, \u2026,  W }. The first result answers an open problem in [Nanongkai, STOC 2014]. The second result partially answers an open problem raised by McGregor in 2006 [ sublinear.info , Problem 14].", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Vienna", "Max Planck Society", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Monika Henzinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henzinger:Monika", "Sebastian Krinninger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krinninger:Sebastian", "Danupon Nanongkai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanongkai:Danupon"], "pages": 10}
