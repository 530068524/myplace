For spatial scalable intra-coded frames, the prediction of macroblock in the enhancement layer is obtained by upsampling the co-located reconstructed block in the base layer. This inter-layer intra prediction can remove the redundancies between the different layers; however, its performance is limited by the non-ideal upsampling filter and the coding losses of base layer. In order to improve the performance of the inter-layer intra prediction, we propose an optimizing filtering method to enhance the prediction signal in this paper. Adaptive Wiener filters, which are calculated for each slice independently, are used to generate a prediction signal with minimum error energy in a statisitcal way. After this optimizing, the coding efficiency can be increased progressively. Experiments show that up to 6.45% and 15.45% bit rate reduction is achieved for QCIF-CIF scenario and CIF-4CIF scenario, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"], "authors": ["Wenhao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Wenhao", "Aidong Men.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Men:Aidong", "Kan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
