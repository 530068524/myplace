{"title": "Near-Optimal BRL using Optimistic Local Transitions.", "fields": ["heuristic", "sample complexity", "dilemma", "combinatorial explosion"], "abstract": "Model-based Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) allows a sound formalization of the problem of acting optimally while facing an unknown environment, i.e., avoiding the exploration-exploitation dilemma. However, algorithms explicitly addressing BRL suffer from such a combinatorial explosion that a large body of work relies on heuristic algorithms. This paper introduces BOLT, a simple and (almost) deterministic heuristic algorithm for BRL which is optimistic about the transition function. We analyze BOLT's sample complexity, and show that under certain parameters, the algorithm is near-optimal in the Bayesian sense with high probability. Then, experimental results highlight the key differences of this method compared to previous work.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["LORIA, Campus s ... y cedex, FRANCE", "LORIA, Campus s ... y cedex, FRANCE", "LORIA, Campus s ... y cedex, FRANCE"], "authors": ["Mauricio Araya-L\u00f3pez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Araya=L=oacute=pez:Mauricio", "Olivier Buffet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buffet:Olivier", "Vincent Thomas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomas:Vincent"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
