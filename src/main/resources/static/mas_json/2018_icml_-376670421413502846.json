{"title": "Quickshift++: Provably Good Initializations for Sample-Based Mean Shift.", "fields": ["mean shift", "singleton", "cluster analysis", "image segmentation", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We provide initial seedings to the Quick Shift clustering algorithm, which approximate the locally high-density regions of the data. Such seedings act as more stable and expressive cluster-cores than the singleton modes found by Quick Shift. We establish statistical consistency guarantees for this modification. We then show strong clustering performance on real datasets as well as promising applications to image segmentation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Google", "Princeton University", "Uber"], "authors": ["Heinrich Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Heinrich", "Jennifer Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:Jennifer", "Samory Kpotufe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kpotufe:Samory"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
