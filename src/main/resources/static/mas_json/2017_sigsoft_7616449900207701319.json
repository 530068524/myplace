Our framework provides set of multi-platform analysis tools for the virtual machines and mechanism for creating instrumentation and analysis tools. Our framework is based on a lightweight approach to dynamic analysis of binary code executed in virtual machines. This approach is non-intrusive and provides system-wide analysis capabilities. It does not require loading any guest agents and source code of the OS. Therefore it may be applied to ROM-based guest systems and enables using of record/replay of the system execution. We use application binary interface (ABI) of the platform to be analyzed for creating introspection tools. These tools recover the part of kernel-level information related to the system calls executed on the guest machine.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Novgorod State  ... versity, Russia", "Novgorod State  ... versity, Russia", "Novgorod State  ... versity, Russia", "Novgorod State  ... versity, Russia"], "authors": ["Pavel Dovgalyuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dovgalyuk:Pavel", "Natalia Fursova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fursova:Natalia", "Ivan Vasiliev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasiliev:Ivan", "Vladimir Makarov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makarov:Vladimir"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
