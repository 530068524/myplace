Our basic idea is to generate a series of secrets from inevitable transmission errors and other random factors in wireless communications. Because these secrets are constantly extracted from the communication process in realtime, we call them dynamic secrets. Dynamic secrets have interesting security properties. They offer a complementary mechanism to existing security protocols. Even if the adversary exploits a vulnerability and steals the underlying system secret, security can be automatically replenished. In many scenarios, it is also possible to bootstrap a secure communication with the dynamic secrets.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Sheng Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Sheng", "Weibo Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Weibo", "Donald F.
