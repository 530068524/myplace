Multi-Instance Dimensionality Reduction by Learning a Maximum Bag Margin Subspace.", "fields": ["dimensional reduction", "subspace topology", "independent and identically distributed random variables", "curse of dimensionality", "dimensionality reduction"], "abstract": "Multi-instance learning, as other machine learning tasks, also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Although dimensionality reduction methods have been investigated for many years, multi-instance dimensionality reduction methods remain untouched. On the other hand, most algorithms in multi-instance framework treat instances in each bag as independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples, which fail to utilize the structure information conveyed by instances in a bag. In this paper, we propose a multi-instance dimensionality reduction method, which treats instances in each bag as non-i.i.d. samples. To capture the structure information conveyed by instances in a bag, we regard every bag as a whole entity. To utilize the bag label information, we maximize the bag margin between positive and negative bags. By maximizing the defined bag margin objective function, we learn a subspace to obtain salient representation of original data. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "Tsinghua University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Wei Ping.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ping:Wei", "Ye Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ye", "Kexin Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Kexin", "Chi-Hung Chi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chi:Chi=Hung", "Shen Furao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furao:Shen"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
