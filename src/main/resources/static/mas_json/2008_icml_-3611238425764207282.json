In this paper, we first characterize the sample complexity of multi-view  active learning . Under the \u03b1- expansion  assumption, we get an exponential improvement in the sample complexity from usual  O (1/ e ) to  O (log 1/ e ), requiring neither strong assumption on data distribution such as the data is distributed uniformly over the unit sphere in R  d   nor strong assumption on hypothesis class such as linear separators through the origin. We also give an upper bound of the error rate when the \u03b1- expansion  assumption does not hold. Then, we analyze the combination of multi-view active learning and semi-supervised learning and get a further improvement in the sample complexity. Finally, we study the empirical behavior of the two paradigms, which verifies that the combination of multi-view active learning and semi-supervised learning is efficient.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0028:Wei", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "pages": 8}
