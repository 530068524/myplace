Our new method, called Kernel Hyperalignment, expands the scope of hyperalignment to include nonlinear measures of similarity and enables the alignment of multiple datasets with a large number of base features. With direct application to fMRI data analysis, kernel hyperalignment is well-suited for multi-subject alignment of large ROIs, including the entire cortex. We report experiments using real-world, multi-subject fMRI data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics"], "authors": ["Alexander Lorbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lorbert:Alexander", "Peter J.
