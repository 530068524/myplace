Recent introduction of cost-effective depth cameras brings on a new trend of research on body-movement gesture recognition. However, there are two major challenges: i) how to continuously recognize gestures from unsegmented streams, and ii) how to differentiate different styles of a same gesture from other types of gestures. In this paper, we solve these two problems with a new effective and efficient feature extraction method that uses a dynamic matching approach to construct a feature vector for each frame and improves sensitivity to the features of different gestures and decreases sensitivity to the features of gestures within the same class. Our comprehensive experiments on MSRC-12 Kinect Gesture and MSR-Action3D datasets have demonstrated a superior performance than the stat-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Guangxi Normal University", "University of Adelaide"], "authors": ["Xin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xin", "Xue Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xue", "Chaoyi Pang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pang:Chaoyi", "Xiaofeng Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaofeng", "Quan Z.
