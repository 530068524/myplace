{"title": "Convergence rate of riemannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and faster polytope volume computation.", "fields": ["hamiltonian mechanics", "bounded function", "riemannian manifold", "hybrid monte carlo", "smoothness"], "abstract": "We give the first rigorous proof of the convergence of Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a general (and practical) method for sampling Gibbs distributions. Our analysis shows that the rate of convergence is bounded in terms of natural smoothness parameters of an associated Riemannian manifold. We then apply the method with the manifold defined by the log barrier function to the problems of (1) uniformly sampling a polytope and (2) computing its volume, the latter by extending Gaussian cooling to the manifold setting. In both cases, the total number of steps needed is  O  * ( mn  2/3 ), improving the state of the art. A key ingredient of our analysis is a proof of an analog of the KLS conjecture for Gibbs distributions over manifolds.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "Santosh S.
