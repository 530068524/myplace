{"title": "WhittleSearch: Image search with relative attribute feedback.", "fields": ["relevance feedback", "ranking", "image retrieval", "feature vector", "iterated function"], "abstract": "We propose a novel mode of feedback for image search, where a user describes which properties of exemplar images should be adjusted in order to more closely match his/her mental model of the image(s) sought. For example, perusing image results for a query \u201cblack shoes\u201d, the user might state, \u201cShow me shoe images like these, but sportier.\u201d Offline, our approach first learns a set of ranking functions, each of which predicts the relative strength of a nameable attribute in an image (\u2018sportiness\u2019, \u2018furriness\u2019, etc.). At query time, the system presents an initial set of reference images, and the user selects among them to provide relative attribute feedback. Using the resulting constraints in the multi-dimensional attribute space, our method updates its relevance function and re-ranks the pool of images. This procedure iterates using the accumulated constraints until the top ranked images are acceptably close to the user's envisioned target. In this way, our approach allows a user to efficiently \u201cwhittle away\u201d irrelevant portions of the visual feature space, using semantic language to precisely communicate her preferences to the system. We demonstrate the technique for refining image search for people, products, and scenes, and show it outperforms traditional binary relevance feedback in terms of search speed and accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (243)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Toyota Technological Institute", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Adriana Kovashka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kovashka:Adriana", "Devi Parikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parikh:Devi", "Kristen Grauman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grauman:Kristen"], "pages": 8}
