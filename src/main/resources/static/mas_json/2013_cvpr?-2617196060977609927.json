{"title": "Underwater Camera Calibration Using Wavelength Triangulation.", "fields": ["camera resectioning", "triangulation", "refraction", "camera auto calibration", "image formation"], "abstract": "In underwater imagery, the image formation process includes refractions that occur when light passes from water into the camera housing, typically through a flat glass port. We extend the existing work on physical refraction models by considering the dispersion of light, and derive new constraints on the model parameters for use in calibration. This leads to a novel calibration method that achieves improved accuracy compared to existing work. We describe how to construct a novel calibration device for our method and evaluate the accuracy of the method through synthetic and real experiments.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Memorial University of Newfoundland", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Timothy Yau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yau:Timothy", "Minglun Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Minglun", "Yee-Hong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yee=Hong"], "pages": 8}
