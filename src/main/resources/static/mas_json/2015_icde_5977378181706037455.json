{"title": "Online Frequent Episode Mining.", "fields": ["trie", "online and offline", "completeness", "data set", "soundness"], "abstract": "Frequent episode mining is a popular framework for discovering sequential patterns from sequence data. Previous studies on this topic usually process data offline in a batch mode. However, for fast-growing sequence data, old episodes may become obsolete while new useful episodes keep emerging. More importantly, in time-critical applications we need a fast solution to discovering the latest frequent episodes from growing data. To this end, we formulate the problem of Online Frequent Episode Mining (OFEM). By introducing the concept of last episode occurrence within a time window, our solution can detect new minimal episode occurrences efficiently, based on which all recent frequent episodes can be discovered directly. Additionally, a trie-based data structure, episode trie, is developed to store minimal episode occurrences in a compact way. We also formally prove the soundness and completeness of our solution and analyze its time as well as space complexity. Experiment results of both online and offline FEM on real data sets show the superiority of our solution.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Xiang Ao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ao:Xiang", "Ping Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0001:Ping", "Chengkai Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chengkai", "Fuzhen Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Fuzhen", "Qing He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Qing"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
