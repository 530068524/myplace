Currently we do not do a good job of documenting this evolution. This essay discusses the need to better document software evolution and introduces the  Moving Picture Metaphor . Source Control Management systems are more like collections of still photographs than moving pictures. Still photography is not ideal when trying to capture evolutional changes. Moving pictures do a much better job. A storyteller can use moving pictures to tell compelling stories that are easier to digest than traditional documentation. We can learn a great deal from watching stories that document a system's evolution.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Carthage College"], "conf": "oopsla", "authors": ["Mark Mahoney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahoney:Mark"], "pages": 4}
