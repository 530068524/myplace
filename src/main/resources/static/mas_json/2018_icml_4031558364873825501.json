Here, we will examine how applying this Hebbian learning rule to a system of interconnected neurons in the presence of direct or indirect re-afference (e.g. seeing/hearing one's own actions) predicts the emergence of mirror neurons with predictive properties. In this framework, we analyse how mirror neurons become a dynamic system that performs active inferences about the actions of others and allows joint actions despite sensorimotor delays. We explore how this system performs a projection of the self onto others, with egocentric biases to contribute to mind-reading. Finally, we argue that Hebbian learning predicts mirror-like neurons for sensations and emotions and review evidence for the presence of such vicarious activations outside the motor system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Groningen", "Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience", "University Medical Center Groningen", "University of Groningen", "Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience", "University Medical Center Groningen", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "East China University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Junhyuk Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Junhyuk", "Yijie Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yijie", "Satinder Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Satinder", "Honglak Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Honglak"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
