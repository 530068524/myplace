In this paper we present four major design steps that harness high-level synthesis (HLS) to implement scalable spatial FPGA algorithms. To aid productivity, we introduce the open source library  hlslib  to complement HLS. We evaluate kernels designed with our approach on an FPGA accelerator board, demonstrating high performance and board utilization with enhanced programmer productivity. By following our guidelines, programmers can use HLS to develop efficient parallel algorithms for FPGA, scaling their implementations with increased resources on future hardware.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Xilinx", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Johannes de Fine Licht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Licht:Johannes_de_Fine", "Michaela Blott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blott:Michaela", "Torsten Hoefler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoefler:Torsten"], "pages": 2}
