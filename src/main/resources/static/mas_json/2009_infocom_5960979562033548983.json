{"title": "A Measurement Based Rogue AP Detection Scheme.", "fields": ["rogue access point", "operator", "round trip delay time", "domain name system", "server"], "abstract": "This paper considers a category of rogue access points (APs) that pretend to be legitimate APs to lure users to connect to them. We propose a practical timing based technique that allows the user to avoid connecting to rogue APs. Our method employs the round trip time between the user and the DNS server to independently determine whether an AP is legitimate or not without assistance from the WLAN operator. We implemented our detection technique on commercially available wireless cards to evaluate their performance.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Hao Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Hao", "Bo Sheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheng:Bo", "Chiu Chiang Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chiu_Chiang", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun", "Sanglu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Sanglu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
