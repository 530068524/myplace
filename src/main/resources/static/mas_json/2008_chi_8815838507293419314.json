In recent years, investigators have employed automated experience sampling to collect data to build predictive user models. To date, most procedures have relied on random sampling or simple heuristics. We perform a comparative analysis of several automated strategies for guiding experience sampling, spanning a spectrum of sophistication, from a random sampling procedure to increasingly sophisticated active learning. The more sophisticated methods take a decision-theoretic approach, centering on the computation of the expected value of information of a probe, weighing the cost of the short-term disruptiveness of probes with their benefits in enhancing the long-term performance of predictive models. We test the different approaches in a field study, focused on the task of learning predictive models of the cost of interruption.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ashish Kapoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapoor:Ashish", "Eric Horvitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horvitz:Eric"], "pages": 10}
