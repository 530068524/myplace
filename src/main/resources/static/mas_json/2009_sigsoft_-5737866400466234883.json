We posit that synthesizing partial component-level behavior models from these early specifications can improve software development practices. In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for deriving a Modal Transition System (MTS) for individual system components from system-level scenario and property specifications. The generated MTSs capture the possible component implementations that (1) necessarily provide the behavior required by the scenarios, (2) restrict behavior forbidden by the properties, and (3) leave the behavior that is neither explicitly required nor forbidden as undefined. We also show how our algorithm helps to discover potential design flaws.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Ivo Krka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krka:Ivo", "Yuriy Brun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brun:Yuriy", "George Edwards.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edwards:George", "Nenad Medvidovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medvidovic:Nenad"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
