{"title": "Enhancing Evaluation of Potential Dates Online Through Paired Collaborative Activities.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "online participation", "multimedia", "psychology", "big five personality traits"], "abstract": "Online dating systems are the most common way people meet their marriage partners online. Nevertheless, online daters struggle to evaluate personality traits of potential partners using profile pages and private messaging in these systems. Meanwhile, Multiplayer Online Games (MOGs) have emerged as a popular way young people find romantic partners for relationships in the physical world. We conducted two interview studies -- one concerning evaluation behavior in online dating systems (n=41) and the other concerning collaborative activities in MOGs (n=35). Insights from these studies reveal the weaknesses in evaluation tools native to online dating and suggest that collaborative activities could potentially address evaluation challenges in online dating. The paper concludes with a discussion of a series of design concepts for online dating in order to improve users' abilities to evaluate their potential romantic partners for in-person meetings.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["New Jersey Institute of Technology", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Eastern Connecticut State University", "Indiana University Bloomington", "New Jersey Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Douglas Zytko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zytko:Douglas", "Guo Freeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freeman:Guo", "Sukeshini A.
