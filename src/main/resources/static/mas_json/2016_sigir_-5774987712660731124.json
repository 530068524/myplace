However, many available annotation data include missing or inaccurate annotations. In this paper, we propose an image annotation framework which sequentially performs tag completion and refinement. We utilize the subspace property of data via sparse subspace clustering for tag completion. Then we propose a novel matrix completion model for tag refinement, integrating visual correlation, semantic correlation and the novelly studied property of complex errors. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmark datasets even when they contain certain levels of annotation noise.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Yuqing Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Yuqing", "Zhouchen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhouchen", "Jin-ge Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Jin=ge"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
