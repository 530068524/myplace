The launching point for our results will be the utilization of a \u201cleveled\u201d multilinear map setting for which Garg, Gentry, and Halevi (GGH) recently gave an approximate candidate. Our first step is the creation of a standard model signature scheme that exhibits the structure of the Boneh, Lynn and Shacham signatures. In particular, this gives us a signature that admits unrestricted aggregation.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Susan Hohenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hohenberger:Susan", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit", "Brent Waters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waters:Brent"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 19}
