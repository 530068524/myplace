{"title": "Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "machine learning", "linear model", "regret", "active learning"], "abstract": "We explore the sequential decision-making problem where the goal is to estimate a number of linear models uniformly well, given a shared budget of random contexts independently sampled from a known distribution. For each incoming context, the decision-maker selects one of the linear models and receives an observation that is corrupted by the unknown noise level of that model. We present Trace-UCB, an adaptive allocation algorithm that learns the models' noise levels while balancing contexts accordingly across them, and prove bounds for its simple regret in both expectation and high-probability. We extend the algorithm and its bounds to the high dimensional setting , where the number of linear models times the dimension of the contexts is more than the total budget of samples. Simulations with real data suggest that Trace-UCB is remarkably robust , outperforming a number of baselines even when its assumptions are violated.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Adobe Systems", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Carlos Riquelme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riquelme:Carlos", "Mohammad Ghavamzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghavamzadeh:Mohammad", "Alessandro Lazaric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazaric:Alessandro"], "pages": 9}
