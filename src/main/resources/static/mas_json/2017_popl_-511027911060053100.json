In manifest contract systems, contracts are part of static types and contract verification is hybrid in the sense that some contracts are statically verified, typically by subtyping, but others are dynamically by casts. It is, however, not trivial to extend existing manifest contract systems, which have been designed mostly for pure functional languages, to imperative features, mainly because of the lack of flow-sensitivity, which should be taken into account in verifying imperative programs statically.   We develop an imperative higher-order manifest contract system I\ufffd  ref    H   for flow-sensitive hybrid contract verification. We introduce a  computational  variant of Nanevski et al\u00e2  s Hoare types, which are flow-sensitive types to represent pre- and postconditions of impure computation. Our Hoare types are computational in the sense that pre- and postconditions are given by Booleans in the same language as programs so that they are dynamically verifiable. I\ufffd  ref    H   also supports refinement types as in existing manifest contract systems to describe flow-insensitive, state-independent contracts of pure computation. While it is desirable that any\u00e2  possibly state-manipulating\u00e2  predicate can be used in contracts, abuse of stateful operations will break the system. To control stateful operations in contracts, we introduce a region-based effect system, which allows contracts in refinement types and computational Hoare types to manipulate states, as long as they are  observationally  pure and read-only, respectively. We show that dynamic contract checking in our calculus is consistent with static typing in the sense that the final result obtained without dynamic contract violations satisfies contracts in its static type. It in particular means that the state after stateful computations satisfies their postconditions.   As in some of prior manifest contract systems, static contract verification in this work is \u00e2  post facto,\u00e2   that is, we first define our manifest contract system so that all contracts are checked at run time, formalize conditions when dynamic checks can be removed safely, and show that programs with and without such removable checks are contextually equivalent. We also apply the idea of post facto verification to  region-based  local reasoning, inspired by the frame rule of Separation Logic.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["IBM", "Kyoto University"], "authors": ["Taro Sekiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sekiyama:Taro", "Atsushi Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Atsushi"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 15}
