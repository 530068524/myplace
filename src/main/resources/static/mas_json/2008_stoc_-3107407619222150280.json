{"title": "Pricing combinatorial markets for tournaments.", "fields": ["prediction market", "joint probability distribution", "scoring rule", "market maker", "of the form"], "abstract": "In a prediction market, agents trade assets whose value is tied to a future event, for example the outcome of the next presidential election. Asset prices determine a probability distribution over the set of possible outcomes. Typically, the outcome space is small, allowing agents to directly trade in each outcome, and allowing a market maker to explicitly update asset prices. Combinatorial markets, in contrast, work to estimate a full joint distribution of dependent observations, in which case the outcome space grows exponentially. In this paper, we consider the problem of pricing combinatorial markets for single-elimination tournaments. With $n$ competing teams, the outcome space is of size 2 n-1 . We show that the general pricing problem for tournaments is P-hard. We derive a polynomial-time algorithm for a restricted betting language based on a Bayesian network representation of the probability distribution. The language is fairly natural in the context of tournaments, allowing for example bets of the form \"team i wins game k\". We believe that our betting language is the first for combinatorial market makers that is both useful and tractable. We briefly discuss a heuristic approximation technique for the general case.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yiling Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yiling", "Sharad Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Sharad", "David M.
