{"title": "XColor: Protecting general proximity privacy.", "fields": ["countermeasure", "information sensitivity", "microdata", "proximate", "information privacy"], "abstract": "As a severe threat in anonymized data publication, proximity breach is gaining increasing attention. Such breach occurs when an attacker learns with high confidence that the sensitive information of a victim associates with a set of semantically proximate values, even though not sure about the exact one. Recently (\u2208, \u03b4)-dissimilarity [14] has been proposed as an effective countermeasure against general proximity attack. In this paper, we present a detailed analytical study on the fulfillment of this principle, derive criteria to efficiently test its satisfiability for given microdata, and point to a novel anonymization model, XCOLOR, with theoretical guarantees on both operation efficiency and utility preservation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ting Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0006:Ting", "Ling Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ling"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
