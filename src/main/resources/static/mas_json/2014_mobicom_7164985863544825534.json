It is presenting a flexible way to share resources between multiple operators in order to increase spectral efficiency. In this trial the differences in traffic patterns of the mobile network operators are exploited to ease up the peak traffic demands of particular operator. This shared recourse is also usable for inter-operator D2D communication, when two users of different operators want to communicate and operators need to negotiate resource allocation for this communication link. We will also introduce Wireless Open Access Research Platform as our choice for the implementation of this trial.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Markku Jokinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jokinen:Markku", "Marko M\u00e4kel\u00e4inen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=auml=kel=auml=inen:Marko", "Tuomo H\u00e4nninen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=nninen:Tuomo"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
