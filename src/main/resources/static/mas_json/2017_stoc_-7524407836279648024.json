Each update is supported in  O ( n  1/2 \u00e2    c  ) worst-case time w.h.p.\ufffd where  c  > 0 is some constant, and this bound also holds in expectation. This is the first data structure achieving an improvement over the  O (\u00e2   n ) deterministic worst-case update time of Eppstein et al., a bound that has been standing for 25 years. In fact, it was previously not even known how to maintain a spanning forest of an unweighted graph in worst-case time polynomially faster than I (\u00e2   n ). Our result is achieved by first giving a reduction from fully-dynamic to decremental minimum spanning forest preserving worst-case update time up to logarithmic factors. Then decremental minimum spanning forest is solved using several novel techniques, one of which involves keeping track of low-conductance cuts in a dynamic graph. An immediate corollary of our result is the first Las Vegas data structure for fully-dynamic connectivity where each update is handled in worst-case time polynomially faster than I (\u00e2   n ) w.h.p.; this data structure has  O (1) worst-case query time.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Christian Wulff-Nilsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulff=Nilsen:Christian"], "pages": 14}
