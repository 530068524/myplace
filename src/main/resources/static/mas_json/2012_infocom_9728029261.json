{"title": "L", "fields": [], "abstract": "Publishing data about individuals without revealing sensitive information about them is an important problem. In recent years, a new definition of privacy called  k -anonymity has gained popularity. In a  k -anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least  k  \u2212 1 other records with respect to certain identifying attributes.   In this article, we show using two simple attacks that a  k -anonymized dataset has some subtle but severe privacy problems. First, an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. This is a known problem. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that  k -anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks, and we propose a novel and powerful privacy criterion called e-diversity that can defend against such attacks. In addition to building a formal foundation for e-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that e-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.", "citation": "Citations (3,331)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "California Institute of Technology", "Colorado School of Mines", "Stanford University", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Peking University", "Zhejiang University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Zhejiang University", "University of Washington", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Peking University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "AT&T Labs", "Temple University", "Temple University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook"], "authors": ["Zhichao Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Zhichao", "Yuan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0004:Yuan", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
