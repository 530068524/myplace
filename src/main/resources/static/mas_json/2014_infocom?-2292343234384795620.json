Previous work provided methods that guarantee failure recovery from at most two-link failures. We develop an IP fast reroute method that employs rooted arc-disjoint spanning trees to guarantee recovery from up to   $(k-1)$    link failures in a   $k$  -edge-connected network. As arc-disjoint spanning trees may be constructed in sub-quadratic time in the size of the network, our approach offers excellent scalability. Through experimental results, we show that employing arc-disjoint spanning trees to recover from multiple failures reduces path stretch in comparison with previously known techniques.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "University of Arizona"], "authors": ["Theodore Elhourani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elhourani:Theodore", "Abishek Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Abishek", "Srinivasan Ramasubramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramasubramanian:Srinivasan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
