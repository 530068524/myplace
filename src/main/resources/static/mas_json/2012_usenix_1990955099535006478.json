{"title": "High Performance Vehicular Connectivity with Opportunistic Erasure Coding.", "fields": ["pluribus", "lossy compression", "erasure", "erasure code", "spare part"], "abstract": "Motivated by poor network connectivity from moving vehicles, we develop a new loss recovery method called opportunistic erasure coding (OEC). Unlike existing erasure codingmethods, which are oblivious to the level of spare capacity along a path, OEC transmits coded packets only during instantaneous openings in a path's spare capacity. This transmission strategy ensures that coded packets provide as much protection as the level of spare capacity allows, without delaying or stealing capacity fromdata packets. OEC uses a novel encoding that greedily maximizes the amount of new data recovered by the receiver with each coded packet. We design and implement a system called PluriBus that uses OEC in the vehicular context. We deploy it on two buses for two months and show that PluriBus reduces the mean flow completion time by a factor of 4 for a realistic workload. We also show that OEC outperforms existing loss recovery methods in a range of lossy environments.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Ratul Mahajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahajan:Ratul", "Jitendra Padhye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padhye:Jitendra", "Sharad Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Sharad", "Brian Zill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zill:Brian"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
