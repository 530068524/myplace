Provable security against differential and linear cryptanalysis in the related-key scenario is an important step towards a better understanding of its construction.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Rennes", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Pierre-Alain Fouque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fouque:Pierre=Alain", "J\u00e9r\u00e9my Jean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jean:J=eacute=r=eacute=my", "Thomas Peyrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peyrin:Thomas"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 21}
