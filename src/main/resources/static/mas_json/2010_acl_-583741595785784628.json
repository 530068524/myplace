{"title": "Efficient Inference through Cascades of Weighted Tree Transducers.", "fields": ["machine translation", "on the fly", "inference", "theory", "syntax"], "abstract": "Weighted tree transducers have been proposed as useful formal models for representing syntactic natural language processing applications, but there has been little description of inference algorithms for these automata beyond formal foundations. We give a detailed description of algorithms for application of cascades of weighted tree transducers to weighted tree acceptors, connecting formal theory with actual practice. Additionally, we present novel on-the-fly variants of these algorithms, and compare their performance on a syntax machine translation cascade based on (Yamada and Knight, 2001).", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jonathan May.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/May:Jonathan", "Kevin Knight.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knight:Kevin", "Heiko Vogler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogler:Heiko"], "pages": 9}
