In this paper, we propose a novel way to balance the throughput and fairness objectives with linear programming. It allows the network operator to precisely control the trade-off by bounding the fairness degradation for each commodity compared to the max-min fair solution or the throughput degradation compared to the optimal throughput. We also present improvements to a previous algorithm that achieves max-min fairness by solving a series of linear programs. We significantly reduce the number of steps needed when the access rate of commodities is limited. We extend the algorithm to two important practical use cases: importance weights and piece-wise linear utility functions for commodities. Our experiments on synthetic and real networks show that our algorithms achieve a significant speedup and provide practical insights on the trade-off between fairness and throughput.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Emilie Danna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danna:Emilie", "Subhasree Mandal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mandal:Subhasree", "Arjun Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Arjun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
