In this work, we study this question in the context of data streams, where elements arrive one at a time, and we want to design low-memory and fast update-time algorithms that maintain a good solution. Specifically, we focus on the sliding window model, where we are asked to maintain a solution that considers only the last W items.\n\nIn this context, we provide the first non-trivial algorithm that maintains a provable approximation of the optimum using space sublinear in the size of the window. In particular we give a 1/3 - e approximation algorithm that uses space polylogarithmic in the spread of the values of the elements, \u03b4, and linear in the solution size k for any constant e > 0. At the same time, processing each element only requires a polylogarithmic number of evaluations of the function itself. When a better approximation is desired, we show a different algorithm that, at the cost of using more memory, provides a 1/2 - e approximation, and allows a tunable trade-off between average update time and space. This algorithm matches the best known approximation guarantees for submodular optimization in insertion-only streams, a less general formulation of the problem.\n\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithms on a number of real world datasets, showing that their practical performance far exceeds the theoretical bounds. The algorithms preserve high quality solutions in streams with millions of items, while storing a negligible fraction of them.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Alessandro Epasto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Epasto:Alessandro", "Silvio Lattanzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lattanzi:Silvio", "Sergei Vassilvitskii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vassilvitskii:Sergei", "Morteza Zadimoghaddam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zadimoghaddam:Morteza"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
