{"title": "Uncovering Causality from Multivariate Hawkes Integrated Cumulants.", "fields": ["statistics", "causality", "matrix", "cumulant", "pattern recognition", "parametric model", "nonparametric statistics", "multivariate statistics"], "abstract": "We design a new nonparametric method that allows one to estimate the matrix of integrated kernels of a multivariate Hawkes process. This matrix not only encodes the mutual influences of each nodes of the process, but also disentangles the causality relationships between them. Our approach is the first that leads to an estimation of this matrix without any parametric modeling and estimation of the kernels themselves. A consequence is that it can give an estimation of causality relationships between nodes (or users), based on their activity timestamps (on a social network for instance), without knowing or estimating the shape of the activities lifetime. For that purpose, we introduce a moment matching method that fits the third-order integrated cumulants of the process. We show on numerical experiments that our approach is indeed very robust to the shape of the kernels, and gives appealing results on the MemeTracker database.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning", "Capital Fund Management", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Massil Achab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achab:Massil", "Emmanuel Bacry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bacry:Emmanuel", "St\u00e9phane Ga\u00efffas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ga=iuml=ffas:St=eacute=phane", "Iacopo Mastromatteo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mastromatteo:Iacopo", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Muzy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muzy:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
