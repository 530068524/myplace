The KWIK (knows what it knows) framework was designed particularly for its utility in learning settings where active exploration can impact the training examples the learner is exposed to, as is true in reinforcement-learning and active-learning problems. We catalog several KWIK-learnable classes as well as open problems, and demonstrate their applications in experience-efficient reinforcement learning.", "citation": "Citations (180)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Rutgers University", "University of Arizona", "Facebook", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Lihong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Lihong", "Michael L.
