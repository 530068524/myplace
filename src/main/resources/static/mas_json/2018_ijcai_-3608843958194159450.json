{"title": "Reinforced Self-Attention Network: a Hybrid of Hard and Soft Attention for Sequence Modeling.", "fields": ["sampling", "natural language", "sentence", "inference", "rss"], "abstract": "Many natural language processing tasks solely rely on sparse dependencies between a few tokens in a sentence. Soft attention mechanisms show promising performance in modeling local/global dependencies by soft probabilities between every two tokens, but they are not effective and efficient when applied to long sentences. By contrast, hard attention mechanisms directly select a subset of tokens but are difficult and inefficient to train due to their combinatorial nature. In this paper, we integrate both soft and hard attention into one context fusion model, \"reinforced self-attention (ReSA)\", for the mutual benefit of each other. In ReSA, a hard attention trims a sequence for a soft self-attention to process, while the soft attention feeds reward signals back to facilitate the training of the hard one. For this purpose, we develop a novel hard attention called \"reinforced sequence sampling (RSS)\", selecting tokens in parallel and trained via policy gradient. Using two RSS modules, ReSA efficiently extracts the sparse dependencies between each pair of selected tokens. We finally propose an RNN/CNN-free sentence-encoding model, \"reinforced self-attention network (ReSAN)\", solely based on ReSA. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) and Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK) datasets.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Washington", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Griffith University"], "authors": ["Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Tao", "Tianyi Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Tianyi", "Guodong Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Guodong", "Jing Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Jing", "Sen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Sen", "Chengqi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chengqi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
