Their performances on image annotation, however, are mixed as for certain concepts the single-instance representations of images are more suitable, while for some other concepts the multiple-instance representations are better. Thus in this paper, we explore an unified learning framework that combines the multiple-instance and single-instance representations for image annotation. More specifically, we propose an integrated graph-based semi-supervised learning framework to utilize these two types of representations simultaneously, and explore an effective and computationally efficient strategy to convert the multiple-instance representation into a single-instance one. Experiments conducted on the Coral image dataset show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed integrated framework.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "University of Science and Technology of China", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Jinhui Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jinhui", "Haojie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Haojie", "Guo-Jun Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Guo=Jun", "Tat-Seng Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Tat=Seng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
