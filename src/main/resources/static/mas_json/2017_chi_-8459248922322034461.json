We present a field investigation of public WiFi hotspots in Havana, Cuba, and examine the possibilities of internet access these limited and expensive hotspots present to individuals, many of who are experiencing the internet for the first time. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in 2015-2016, we underscore the reconfigurations that have resulted from this access, as evolving internet users reconfigure their interactions with place, time, and individuals in their efforts to locate the internet. We also discuss the implications our findings have for the design of internet access interventions in Cuba and in other low-resource environments across the world, as well as the broader implications for social computing across diverse geographies.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Kentucky", "University of Washington", "Google", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Michaelanne Dye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dye:Michaelanne", "David Nemer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nemer:David", "Laura R.
