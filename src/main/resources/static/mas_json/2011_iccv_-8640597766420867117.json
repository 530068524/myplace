Spectrally selective single-shot HDR (S4HDR) imaging treats this as an exposure bracketing. Optimally exposed regions of low dynamic range red/green/blue color components are merged in a principled manner to yield a single HDR color image. Though not expected to yield results superior to the traditional time multiplexing counterparts, the single-shot HDR solution we propose is a robust alternative that can be realized with conventional camera hardware.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Dayton", "University of Dayton"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Keigo Hirakawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirakawa:Keigo", "Paul M.
