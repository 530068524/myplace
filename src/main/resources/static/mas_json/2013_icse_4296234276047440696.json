We illustrate this by summarizing a number of studies on sketching and diagramming across a variety of domains, and arguing for their limited generalizability. In order to develop further insight, we describe the design of a research project we are embarking upon and its grounding theoretical assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["David Socha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Socha:David", "Josh D.
