{"title": "Learning Simple Algorithms from Examples.", "fields": ["multiplication", "simple algorithm", "numerical digit", "bottleneck", "copying"], "abstract": "We present an approach for learning simple algorithms such as copying, multi-digit addition and single digit multiplication directly from examples. Our framework consists of a set of interfaces, accessed by a controller. Typical interfaces are 1-D tapes or 2-D grids that hold the input and output data. For the controller, we explore a range of neural network-based models which vary in their ability to abstract the underlying algorithm from training instances and generalize to test examples with many thousands of digits. The controller is trained using Q-learning with several enhancements and we show that the bottleneck is in the capabilities of the controller rather than in the search incurred by Q-learning.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["New York University", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Wojciech Zaremba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaremba:Wojciech", "Tomas Mikolov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mikolov:Tomas", "Armand Joulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joulin:Armand", "Rob Fergus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fergus:Rob"], "pages": 9}
