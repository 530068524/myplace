An excursion on the second day of the workshop included hiking on trails and rock climbing on the Riesenstein in the Konigstuhl hill of the Odenwald Mountains adjacent to Heidelberg. We recorded accelerometer data and video of hiking and climbing during the excursion. We collected the data and video in order to better understand how to generate labeled events in accelerometer data for us in machine learning of event recognizers for activities done in the mountains. In this paper, we make that data available to the UbiMount community, explain how it was collected and discuss the data collection experience in the mountains.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Brigham Young U.", "Brigham Young U."], "authors": ["Michael D.
