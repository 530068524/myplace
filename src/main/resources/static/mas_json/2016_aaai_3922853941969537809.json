In this paper we develop a non-parametric model based on Gaussian process (GP) regression to capture the complex spatial and temporal dependencies present in the data. A stochastic variational inference approach was adopted to address scalability. Rather than modeling the problem as a time-series as in many studies, we capture the space-time dependencies by combining different kernels. A kernel averaging technique which converts spatially-diffused point processes to an area process is proposed to model geographical distribution. Additionally, to accurately model the variable behavior of the time-series, the GP kernel is further modified to account for non-stationarity and seasonality. Experimental results on two datasets of state-wide US weekly flu-counts consisting of 19,698 and 89,474 data points, ranging over several years, illustrate the robustness of the model as a tool for further epidemiological investigations.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "NICTA", "University of Sydney"], "authors": ["Ransalu Senanayake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Senanayake:Ransalu", "Simon Timothy O'Callaghan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Callaghan:Simon_Timothy", "Fabio Ramos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramos:Fabio"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
