{"title": "What Do We Elect Committees For? A Voting Committee Model for Multi-Winner Rules.", "fields": ["public relations", "management science", "parliament", "computer science", "voting"], "abstract": "We present a new model that describes the process of electing a group of representatives (e.g., a parliament) for a group of voters. In this model, called the voting committee model, the elected group of representatives runs a number of ballots to make final decisions regarding various issues. The satisfaction of voters comes from the final decisions made by the elected committee. Our results suggest that depending on a single-winner election system used by the committee to make these final decisions, different multi-winner election rules are most suitable for electing the committee. Furthermore, we show that if we allow not only a committee, but also an election rule used to make final decisions, to depend on the voters' preferences, we can obtain an even better representation of the voters.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Piotr Krzysztof Skowron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skowron:Piotr_Krzysztof"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
