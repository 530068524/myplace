Building and analyzing such models is important but difficult in certain areas such as safety-critical healthcare processes. Tool-supported techniques are needed to find and correct flaws in such processes. On another hand, event-based formalisms such as Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) prove effective for analyzing agent behaviors.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Radioth\u00e9rapie E ...
