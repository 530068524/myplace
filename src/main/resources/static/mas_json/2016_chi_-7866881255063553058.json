{"title": "'MASTerful' Matchmaking in Service Transactions: Inferred Abilities, Needs and Interests versus Activity Histories.", "fields": ["computer science", "data mining", "blossom algorithm", "database transaction"], "abstract": "Timebanking is a growing type of peer-to-peer service exchange, but is hampered by the effort of finding good transaction partners. We seek to reduce this effort by using a Matching Algorithm for Service Transactions (MAST). MAST matches transaction partners in terms of similarity of interests and complementarity of abilities and needs. We present an experiment involving data and participants from a real timebanking network, that evaluates the acceptability of MAST, and shows that such an algorithm can retrieve matches that are subjectively better than matches based on matching the category of people's historical offers or requests to the category of a current transaction request.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["PARC", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Hyunggu Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Hyunggu", "Victoria Bellotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellotti:Victoria", "Afsaneh Doryab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doryab:Afsaneh", "Dean Leitersdorf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leitersdorf:Dean", "Jiawei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiawei", "Benjamin V.
