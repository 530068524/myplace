By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified scheme, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is effective for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters.", "citation": "Citations (725)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["John Schulman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schulman:John", "Sergey Levine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levine:Sergey", "Pieter Abbeel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbeel:Pieter", "Michael I.
