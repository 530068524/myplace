To increase throughput, replicas are added for each of these machines. The key parameter of these algorithms is the trade-off between replication and partitioning: increasing the partitioning level improves query completion time since more servers handle the query, but may incur non-negligible startup costs for each sub-query. Finding the right operating point and adapting to it can significantly improve performance and reduce costs.   We introduce Rendezvous On a Ring (ROAR), a novel distributed algorithm that enables on-the-fly re-configuration of the partitioning level. ROAR can add and remove servers without stopping the system, cope with server failures, and provide good load-balancing even with a heterogeneous server pool. We demonstrate these claims using a privacy-preserving search application built upon ROAR.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "NEC Europe Ltd. ... elberg, Germany"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Costin Raiciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raiciu:Costin", "Felipe Huici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huici:Felipe", "Mark Handley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Handley:Mark", "David S.
