{"title": "The rumentarium project.", "fields": ["dc motor", "physical modelling synthesis", "physical computing", "microcontroller", "resonator"], "abstract": "The paper describes the design, production and usage of the \"Rumentarium\", a computer-based sound generating system involving physical objects as sound sources. The Rumentarium is a set of handmade resonators, acoustically excited by DC motors, interfaced to a computer by four microcontrollers. Following an ecological/anthropological perspective, in the Rumentarium discarded materials are used as sound sources. While entirely computationally-controlled, the Rumentarium is an acoustic sound generator. The paper provides a general description of the Rumentarium and discusses some artistic applications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Turin"], "authors": ["Andrea Valle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valle:Andrea"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
