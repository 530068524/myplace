{"title": "TACO: Learning Task Decomposition via Temporal Alignment for Control.", "fields": ["domain knowledge", "annotation", "generalization", "modular design", "robotic arm"], "abstract": "Many advanced Learning from Demonstration (LfD) methods consider the decomposition of complex, real-world tasks into simpler sub-tasks. By reusing the corresponding sub-policies within and between tasks, they provide training data for each policy from different high-level tasks and compose them to perform novel ones. Existing approaches to modular LfD focus either on learning a single high-level task or depend on domain knowledge and temporal segmentation. In contrast, we propose a weakly supervised, domain-agnostic approach based on task sketches, which include only the sequence of sub-tasks performed in each demonstration. Our approach simultaneously aligns the sketches with the observed demonstrations and learns the required sub-policies. This improves generalisation in comparison to separate optimisation procedures. We evaluate the approach on multiple domains, including a simulated 3D robot arm control task using purely image-based observations. The results show that our approach performs commensurately with fully supervised approaches, while requiring significantly less annotation effort.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Kyriacos Shiarlis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shiarlis:Kyriacos", "Markus Wulfmeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulfmeier:Markus", "Sasha Salter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salter:Sasha", "Shimon Whiteson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whiteson:Shimon", "Ingmar Posner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Posner:Ingmar"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
