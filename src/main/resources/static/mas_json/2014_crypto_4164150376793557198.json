In fact, the scheme of Coron et al. is the second proposal of a secure GES, and has advantages over the first scheme of Garg, Gentry, and Halevi (GGH). For example, unlike the GGH construction, the subgroup decision assumption holds in the CLT construction. Immediately following the elegant innovations of the GES, numerous GES-based cryptographic applications were proposed. Although these applications rely on the security of the underlying GES, the security of the GES has not been analyzed in detail, aside from the original papers produced by Garg et al. and Coron et al.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Myongji University"], "authors": ["Hyung Tae Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hyung_Tae", "Jae Hong Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Jae_Hong"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2014", "pages": 17}
