{"title": "EMBERS at 4 years: Experiences operating an Open Source Indicators Forecasting System.", "fields": ["food prices", "data mining", "computer science", "currency"], "abstract": "EMBERS is an anticipatory intelligence system forecasting population-level events in multiple countries of Latin America. A deployed system from 2012, EMBERS has been generating alerts 24x7 by ingesting a broad range of data sources including news, blogs, tweets, machine coded events,currency rates, and food prices. In this paper, we describe our experiences operating EMBERS continuously for nearly 4 years, with specific attention to the discoveries it has enabled, correct as well as missed forecasts, lessons learnt from participating in a forecasting tournament, and our perspectives on the limits of forecasting including ethical considerations.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Sathappan Muthiah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muthiah:Sathappan", "Patrick Butler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Butler:Patrick", "Rupinder Paul Khandpur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khandpur:Rupinder_Paul", "Parang Saraf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saraf:Parang", "Nathan Self.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Self:Nathan", "Alla Rozovskaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rozovskaya:Alla", "Liang Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0002:Liang", "Jose Cadena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cadena:Jose", "Chang-Tien Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Chang=Tien", "Anil Vullikanti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vullikanti:Anil", "Achla Marathe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marathe:Achla", "Kristen Maria Summers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Summers:Kristen_Maria", "Graham Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz:Graham", "Andy Doyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doyle:Andy", "Jaime Arredondo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arredondo:Jaime", "Dipak K.
