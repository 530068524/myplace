And what design principles might enable these federated online systems to be more effective? This paper reports on a qualitative study of work and task practices on Wikipedia. Despite the availability of tag-based community-wide task assignment mechanisms, informants reported that self-directed goals, within-topic expertise, and fortuitous discovery are more frequently used than community-tagged tasks. We examine how Wikipedia editors organize their actions and the actions of other participants, and what implications this has for understanding, and building tools for, crowd-powered systems, or any web site where the main   force of production comes from a crowd of online participants. From these observations and insights, we developed WikiTasks, a tool that integrates with Wikipedia and supports both grassroots creation of site-wide tasks and self-selection of personal tasks, accepted from this larger pool of community tasks.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Michel Krieger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krieger:Michel", "Emily Margarete Stark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stark:Emily_Margarete", "Scott R.
