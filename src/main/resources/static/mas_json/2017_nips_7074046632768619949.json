{"title": "An Empirical Study on The Properties of Random Bases for Kernel Methods.", "fields": ["polynomial kernel", "radial basis function kernel", "kernel embedding of distributions", "tree kernel", "graph kernel"], "abstract": "Kernel machines as well as neural networks possess universal function approximation properties. Nevertheless in practice their ways of choosing the appropriate function class differ. Specifically neural networks learn a representation by adapting their basis functions to the data and the task at hand, while kernel methods typically use a basis that is not adapted during training. In this work, we contrast random features of approximated kernel machines with learned features of neural networks. Our analysis reveals how these random and adaptive basis functions affect the quality of learning. Furthermore, we present basis adaptation schemes that allow for a more compact representation, while retaining the generalization properties of kernel machines.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Google", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Maximilian Alber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alber:Maximilian", "Pieter-Jan Kindermans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kindermans:Pieter=Jan", "Kristof Sch\u00fctt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=tt:Kristof", "Klaus-Robert M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Klaus=Robert", "Fei Sha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sha:Fei"], "pages": 12}
