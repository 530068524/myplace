An exponential separation in the other direction was already known from the work of Kerenidis et.\ufffd al.\ufffd [SICOMP 44, pp. 1550\u00e2  1572], hence our work implies that these two complexity measures are incomparable.   As classical information complexity is an upper bound on  quantum information complexity , which in turn is equal to  amortized quantum communication complexity , our work implies that a tight direct sum result for distributional quantum communication complexity cannot hold.   The function we use to present such a separation is the Symmetric  k -ary Pointer Jumping function introduced by Rao and Sinha\ufffd [ECCC TR15-057], whose classical communication complexity is exponentially larger than its classical information complexity. In this paper, we show that the quantum communication complexity of this function is polynomially equivalent to its classical communication complexity. The high-level idea behind our proof is arguably the simplest so far for such an exponential separation between information and communication, driven by a sequence of round-elimination arguments, allowing us to simplify further the approach of Rao and Sinha.   As another application of the techniques that we develop, a simple proof for an optimal trade-off between Alice\u00e2  s and Bob\u00e2  s communication is given, even when allowing pre-shared entanglement, while computing the related Greater-Than function on  n  bits: say Bob communicates at most  b  bits, then Alice must send  n /2  O  ( b )  bits to Bob. We also present a  classical  protocol achieving this bound.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anurag Anshu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anshu:Anurag", "Dave Touchette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Touchette:Dave", "Penghui Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Penghui", "Nengkun Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Nengkun"], "pages": 12}
