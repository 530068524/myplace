{"title": "Opinion Mining on YouTube.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "natural language processing", "tree kernel", "adaptability", "syntax"], "abstract": "This paper defines a systematic approach to Opinion Mining (OM) on YouTube comments by (i) modeling classifiers for predicting the opinion polarity and the type of comment and (ii) proposing robust shallow syntactic structures for improving model adaptability. We rely on the tree kernel technology to automatically extract and learn features with better generalization power than bag-of-words. An extensive empirical evaluation on our manually annotated YouTube comments corpus shows a high classification accuracy and highlights the benefits of structural models in a cross-domain setting.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Trento", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "University of Trento", "University of Copenhagen", "Google"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Aliaksei Severyn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Severyn:Aliaksei", "Alessandro Moschitti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moschitti:Alessandro", "Olga Uryupina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uryupina:Olga", "Barbara Plank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plank:Barbara", "Katja Filippova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filippova:Katja"], "pages": 10}
