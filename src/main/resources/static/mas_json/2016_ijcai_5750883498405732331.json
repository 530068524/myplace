As a case study, we examine functions that evaluate states with a weighted sum of state features. We measure the complexity of a domain by the complexity of the required features. We analyze conditions under which the search algorithm runs in polynomial time and show complexity results for several classical planning domains.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Basel", "University of Basel", "University of Basel", "University of Basel"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jendrik Seipp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seipp:Jendrik", "Florian Pommerening.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pommerening:Florian", "Gabriele R\u00f6ger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=ouml=ger:Gabriele", "Malte Helmert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmert:Malte"], "pages": 9}
