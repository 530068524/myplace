{"title": "Using Double-Oracle Method and Serialized Alpha-Beta Search for Pruning in Simultaneous Move Games.", "fields": ["combinatorial game theory", "extensive form game", "monte carlo tree search", "simultaneous game", "game tree"], "abstract": "We focus on solving two-player zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. In these games, both players fully observe the current state of the game where they simultaneously make a move determining the next state of the game. We solve these games by a novel algorithm that relies on two components: (1) it iteratively solves the games that correspond to a single simultaneous move using a double-oracle method, and (2) it prunes the states of the game using bounds on the sub-game values obtained by the classical Alpha-Beta search on a serialized variant of the game. We experimentally evaluate our algorithm on the Goofspiel card game, a pursuit-evasion game, and randomly generated games. The results show that our novel algorithm typically provides significant running-time improvements and reduction in the number of evaluated nodes compared to the full search algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Branislav Bosansk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosansk=yacute=:Branislav", "Viliam Lis\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lis=yacute=:Viliam", "Jiri Cermak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cermak:Jiri", "Roman Vitek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitek:Roman", "Michal Pechoucek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pechoucek:Michal"], "pages": 7}
