{"title": "Shallow Information Extraction for the knowledge Web.", "fields": ["information extraction", "semantic search", "question answering", "knowledge extraction", "knowledge integration"], "abstract": "A new breed of Information Extraction tools has become popular and shown to be very effective in building massive-scale knowledge bases that fuel applications such as question answering and semantic search. These approaches rely on Web-scale probabilistic models populated through shallow language processing of the text, pre-existing knowledge, and structured data already on the Web. This tutorial provides an introduction to these techniques, starting from the foundations of information extraction, and covering some of its key applications.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Microsoft", "Google"], "authors": ["Denilson Barbosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbosa:Denilson", "Haixun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haixun", "Cong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Cong"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
