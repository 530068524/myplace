In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering method, Combinational Collaborative Filtering (CCF), to perform personalized community recommendations by considering multiple types of co-occurrences in social data at the same time. This filtering method fuses semantic and user information, then applies a hybrid training strategy that combines Gibbs sampling and Expectation-Maximization algorithm. To handle the large-scale dataset, parallel computing is used to speed up the model training. Through an empirical study on the Orkut dataset, we show CCF to be both effective and scalable.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["WenYen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:WenYen", "Dong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dong", "Edward Y.
