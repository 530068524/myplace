{"title": "Symbolic Polytopes for Quantitative Interpolation and Verification.", "fields": ["horn clause", "cardinality", "polytope", "interpolation", "information leakage"], "abstract": "Proving quantitative properties of programs, such as bounds on resource usage or information leakage, often leads to verification conditions that involve cardinalities of sets. Existing approaches for dealing with such verification conditions operate by checking cardinality bounds for given formulas. However, they cannot synthesize formulas that satisfy given cardinality constraints, which limits their applicability for inferring cardinality-based inductive arguments.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "IMDEA", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Klaus von Gleissenthall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gleissenthall:Klaus_von", "Boris K\u00f6pf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=pf:Boris", "Andrey Rybalchenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rybalchenko:Andrey"], "pages": 17}
