Accordingly, microcontroller-based operating systems have not provided important features like fault isolation, dynamic memory allocation, and flexible concurrency. However, an emerging class of embedded applications are software platforms, rather than single purpose devices, and need these multiprogramming features. Tock, a new operating system for low-power platforms, takes advantage of limited hardware-protection mechanisms as well as the type-safety features of the Rust programming language to provide a multiprogramming environment for microcontrollers. Tock isolates software faults, provides memory protection, and efficiently manages memory for dynamic application workloads written in any language. It achieves this while retaining the dependability requirements of long-running applications.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of Virginia", "University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Amit Levy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levy:Amit", "Bradford Campbell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Campbell:Bradford", "Branden Ghena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghena:Branden", "Daniel B.
