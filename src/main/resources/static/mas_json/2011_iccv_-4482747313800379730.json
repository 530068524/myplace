Our algorithm provides a more complete description than existing approaches by reconstructing simultaneously buildings, trees and topologically complex grounds. Buildings are modeled by an original approach which guarantees a high generalization level while having semantized and compact representations. Geometric 3D-primitives such as planes, cylinders, spheres or cones describe regular roof sections, and are combined with mesh-patches that represent irregular roof components. The various urban components interact through a non-convex energy minimization problem in which they are propagated under arrangement constraints over a planimetric map. We experimentally validate the approach on complex urban structures and large urban scenes of millions of points.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Paris"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Florent Lafarge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lafarge:Florent", "Cl\u00e9ment Mallet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mallet:Cl=eacute=ment"], "pages": 8}
