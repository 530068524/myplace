IBR-DTN for Android supports all features of the IBR-DTN version for PCs and embedded systems. It is available in the Google Play Store for free.   In addition to the protocol stack we provide two simple real world applications: a text messaging system and a push-to-talk application. They can serve as an example how to build DTN applications for mobile phones as both applications as well as the protocol implementation itself are open sourced.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Braunschweig University of Technology", "Braunschweig University of Technology", "Braunschweig University of Technology"], "authors": ["Johannes Morgenroth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morgenroth:Johannes", "Sebastian Schildt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schildt:Sebastian", "Lars C.
