Zhu et al. [26] changed all arbitrary pose and illumination images to the frontal view image to use for the invariant feature. In this scheme, preserving identity while rotating pose image is a crucial issue. This paper proposes a new deep architecture based on a novel type of multitask learning, which can achieve superior performance in rotating to a target-pose face image from an arbitrary pose and illumination image while preserving identity. The target pose can be controlled by the user's intention. This novel type of multi-task model significantly improves identity preservation over the single task model. By using all the synthesized controlled pose images, called Controlled Pose Image (CPI), for the pose-illumination-invariant feature and voting among the multiple face recognition results, we clearly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by more than 4\u223c6% on the MultiPIE dataset.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Samsung", "Samsung"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Junho Yim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yim:Junho", "Heechul Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Heechul", "ByungIn Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:ByungIn", "Changkyu Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Changkyu", "Du-Sik Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Du=Sik", "Junmo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Junmo"], "pages": 9}
