Our constructions are asymptotically efficient and highly parallelizable in a practical sense, i.e., they can be computed by simple, relatively small low-depth arithmetic or boolean circuits (e.g., in NC1 or even TC0). In addition, they are the first low-depth PRFs that have no known attack by efficient quantum algorithms. Central to our results is a new \"derandomization\" technique for the learning with errors (LWE) problem which, in effect, generates the error terms deterministically.", "citation": "Citations (173)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Abhishek Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee_0001:Abhishek", "Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris", "Alon Rosen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosen:Alon"], "pages": 19}
