First, the ideal case of perfect instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is treated. Using the drift-plus-penalty method, a dynamic power allocation policy is developed and shown to approach optimality, regardless of the channel state distribution and without requiring knowledge of this distribution. Next, the case of delayed and quantized channel state information is considered. Optimal utility is fundamentally different in this case, and a different online algorithm is developed that is based on convex projections. The proposed algorithm for this delayed-CSIT case is shown to have an O (\u03b4) optimality gap, where \u03b4 is the quantization error of CSIT.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Hao Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0002:Hao", "Michael J.
