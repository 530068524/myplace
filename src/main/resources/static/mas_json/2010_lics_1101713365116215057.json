For this, we define a complete phase semantics for BBI and characterize it as trivial phase semantics. We deduce an embedding between trivial phase semantics for intuitionistic linear logic (ILL) and Kripke semantics for BBI. We single out a fragment of ILL which is both undecidable and complete for trivial phase semantics. Therefore, we obtain the undecidability of BBI.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Dominique Larchey-Wendling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larchey=Wendling:Dominique", "Didier Galmiche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galmiche:Didier"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
