Recently, more and more data-driven applications are being developed in search engines based on search logs, such as query suggestion, keyword bidding, and dissatisfactory query analysis. In this paper, by observing that many data-driven applications in search engines highly rely on online mining of search logs, we develop an OLAP system on search logs which serves as an infrastructure supporting various data-driven applications. An empirical study using real data of over two billion query sessions demonstrates the usefulness and feasibility of our design.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Microsoft", "Simon Fraser University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Bin Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0002:Bin", "Daxin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Daxin", "Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hang"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
