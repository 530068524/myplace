Previous works have assumed that the control performance can be expressed as a function of the sampling rate only. Arguing that the control delay has a large impact on the control performance, in this work we include the control delay in the cost function. The delay is estimated using an approximate response-time analysis. Assuming linear cost functions for the controllers then allows us to solve the optimal period assignment problem analytically. The performance improvements over previous methods are verified in evaluations on synthetic task sets as well as detailed co- simulations of the controllers, the plants, and the scheduler.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies", "Lund University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Enrico Bini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bini:Enrico", "Anton Cervin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cervin:Anton"], "pages": 10}
