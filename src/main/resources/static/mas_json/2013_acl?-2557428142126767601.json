{"title": "Additive Neural Networks for Statistical Machine Translation.", "fields": ["time delay neural network", "word embedding", "embedding", "log linear model", "machine translation"], "abstract": "Most statistical machine translation (SMT) systems are modeled using a loglinear framework. Although the log-linear model achieves success in SMT, it still suffers from some limitations: (1) the features are required to be linear with respect to the model itself; (2) features cannot be further interpreted to reach their potential. A neural network is a reasonable method to address these pitfalls. However, modeling SMT with a neural network is not trivial, especially when taking the decoding efficiency into consideration. In this paper, we propose a variant of a neural network, i.e. additive neural networks, for SMT to go beyond the log-linear translation model. In addition, word embedding is employed as the input to the neural network, which encodes each word as a feature vector. Our model outperforms the log-linear translation models with/without embedding features on Chinese-to-English and Japanese-to-English translation tasks.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Lemao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Lemao", "Taro Watanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watanabe:Taro", "Eiichiro Sumita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sumita:Eiichiro", "Tiejun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Tiejun"], "pages": 11}
