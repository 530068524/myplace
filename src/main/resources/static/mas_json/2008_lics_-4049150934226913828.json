{"title": "On the Axiomatizability of Impossible Futures: Preorder versus Equivalence.", "fields": ["preorder", "modulo", "alphabet", "equivalence", "futures contract", "axiom"], "abstract": "We investigate the (in)equational theory of impossible futures semantics over the process algebra BCCSP. We prove that no finite, sound axiomatization for BCCSP modulo impossible futures equivalence is ground-complete. By contrast, we present a finite, sound, ground-complete axiomatization for BCCSP modulo impossible futures preorder. If the alphabet of actions is infinite, then this axiomatization is shown to be omega-complete. If the alphabet is finite, we prove that the in equational theory of BCCSP modulo impossible futures preorder lacks such a finite basis. We also derive non-finite axiomatizability results for nested impossible futures semantics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["CWI, Amsterdam", "Theoretical Computer Science"], "authors": ["Taolue Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Taolue", "Wan Fokkink.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fokkink:Wan"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
