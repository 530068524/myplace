{"title": "Topical query decomposition.", "fields": ["web query classification", "web search query", "constrained clustering", "sargable", "brown clustering"], "abstract": "We introduce the problem of query decomposition, where we are given a query and a document retrieval system, and we want to produce a small set of queries whose union of resulting documents corresponds approximately to that of the original query. Ideally, these queries should represent coherent, conceptually well-separated topics.   We provide an abstract formulation of the query decomposition problem, and we tackle it from two different perspectives. We first show how the problem can be instantiated as a specific variant of a set cover problem, for which we provide an efficient greedy algorithm. Next, we show how the same problem can be seen as a constrained clustering problem, with a very particular kind of constraint, i.e.,  clustering with predefined clusters . We develop a two-phase algorithm based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering followed by dynamic programming. Our experiments, conducted on a set of actual queries in a Web scale search engine, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Francesco Bonchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonchi:Francesco", "Carlos Castillo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castillo_0001:Carlos", "Debora Donato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donato:Debora", "Aristides Gionis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gionis:Aristides"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
