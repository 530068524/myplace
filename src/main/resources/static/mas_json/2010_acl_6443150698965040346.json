We use a topic model to decompose this conditional probability into two conditional probabilities with latent variables. We propose three different instantiations of the model for solving sense disambiguation problems with different degrees of resource availability. The proposed models are tested on three different tasks: coarse-grained word sense disambiguation, fine-grained word sense disambiguation, and detection of literal vs. non-literal usages of potentially idiomatic expressions. In all three cases, we outperform state-of-the-art systems either quantitatively or statistically significantly.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Linlin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Linlin", "Benjamin Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Benjamin", "Caroline Sporleder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sporleder:Caroline"], "pages": 10}
