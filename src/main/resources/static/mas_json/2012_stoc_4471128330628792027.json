Our main results are: (1) If d=2 then w = \u0398(n ({log n/ log log n}) 2 ). (2) If d=3 then w = \u0398(n lg lg n). (3) If d=2k or d=2k+1 for some integer k \u2265 2 then w = \u0398(n \u03bb k (n)), where \u03bb 1 (n)=\u2308 log n\u2309, \u03bb i+1 (n)= \u03bb i *(n), and the * operation gives how many times one has to iterate the function \u03bb i  to reach a value at most 1 from the argument n. (4) If d=log* n then w=O(n).   For depth d=2, our \u03a9(n (log n/log log n) 2 ) lower bound gives the largest known lower bound for computing any linear map.   Using a result by Ishai, Kushilevitz, Ostrovsky, and Sahai (2008), we also obtain similar bounds for computing pairwise-independent hash functions.   Our lower bounds are based on a superconcentrator-like condition that the graphs of circuits computing good codes must satisfy. This condition is provably intermediate between superconcentrators and their weakenings considered before.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Aarhus University", "Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic", "Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic", "Northeastern University", "University of Texas at Austin", "Aarhus University", "Northeastern University", "Inst. of Math., ...
