The problem is extremely challenging and general inference remains computationally expensive. We seek to address this problem by observing that in most specific applications of a model, we typically only need to perform a small subset of all possible inference computations. Motivated by this, we introduce just-in-time learning, a framework for fast and flexible inference that learns to speed up inference at run-time. Through a series of experiments, we show how this framework can allow us to combine the flexibility of sampling with the efficiency of deterministic message-passing.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["S.
