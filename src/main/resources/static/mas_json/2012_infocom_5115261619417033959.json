In this OSA problem each channel is modeled as a two state discrete time Markov chain with a bad state which yields no reward and a good state which yields reward. This is known as the Gilbert-Elliot channel model and represents variations in the channel condition due to fading, primary user activity, etc. There is a user who can transmit on one channel at a time, and whose goal is to maximize its throughput. Without knowing the transition probabilities and only observing the state of the channel currently selected, the user faces a partially observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with unknown transition structure. In general, learning the optimal policy in this setting is intractable. We propose a computationally efficient learning algorithm which is approximately optimal for the infinite horizon average reward criterion.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Cem Tekin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tekin:Cem", "Mingyan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Mingyan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
