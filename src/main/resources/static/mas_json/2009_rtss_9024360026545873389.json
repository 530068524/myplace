Automatic memory management, or garbage collection, is a key enabler for robust, reusable libraries, yet remains a challenge for analysis and implementation of real-time execution environments. This paper comprehensively compares the two leading approaches to hard real-time garbage collection. While there are many design decisions involved in selecting a real-time garbage collection algorithm, for time-based garbage collectors researchers and practitioners remain undecided as to whether to choose periodic scheduling or slack-based scheduling. A significant impediment to valid experimental comparison is that the commercial implementations use completely different proprietary infrastructures. Here, we present Minuteman, a framework for experimenting with real-time collection algorithms in the context of a high-performance execution environment for real-time Java. We provide the first comparison of the two approaches, both experimentally using realistic workloads, and analytically in terms of schedulability.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Tomas Kalibera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalibera:Tomas", "Filip Pizlo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pizlo:Filip", "Antony L.
