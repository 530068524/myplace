{"title": "Using probabilistic generative models for ranking risks of Android apps.", "fields": ["ranking", "malware", "generative grammar", "naive bayes classifier", "android", "ranging"], "abstract": "One of Android's main defense mechanisms against malicious apps is a risk communication mechanism which, before a user installs an app, warns the user about the permissions the app requires, trusting that the user will make the right decision. This approach has been shown to be ineffective as it presents the risk information of each app in a \"tand-alone\" ashion and in a way that requires too much technical knowledge and time to distill useful information.   We introduce the notion of risk scoring and risk ranking for Android apps, to improve risk communication for Android apps, and identify three desiderata for an effective risk scoring scheme. We propose to use probabilistic generative models for risk scoring schemes, and identify several such models, ranging from the simple Naive Bayes, to advanced hierarchical mixture models. Experimental results conducted using real-world datasets show that probabilistic general models significantly outperform existing approaches, and that Naive Bayes models give a promising risk scoring approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Hao Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Hao", "Christopher S.
