{"title": "News Feed: What's in it for Me?", "fields": ["annoyance", "activities of daily living", "ranging", "frustration", "social network"], "abstract": "Over a billion people use social networking sites like Facebook to maintain awareness of their friends. Facebook's News Feed is the primary mechanism by which people are shown updates about their friends' daily activities on the site in the form of an algorithmically curated list of stories. This paper examines how people browse the News Feed, their perceptions and satisfaction while using it, and the interactions they make with their personal social network. We conducted a qualitative study involving think-aloud semi-structured interviews as the participants casually browsed their own feeds. We observed a wide variation in the use of the News Feed ranging from careful consideration of social conventions, judgment of people, and annoyance and frustration towards certain friends. Our findings suggest that people do not deliberately curate their own News Feed either due to lack of awareness or perceived social repercussions.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Paul Lapides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lapides:Paul", "Apoorve Chokshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chokshi:Apoorve", "Sheelagh Carpendale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carpendale:Sheelagh", "Saul Greenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenberg:Saul"], "pages": 10}
