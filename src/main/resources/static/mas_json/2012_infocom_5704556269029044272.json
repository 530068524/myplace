A vulnerability of existing link signature schemes has been identified by introducing a new attack, called mimicry attack. To defend against the mimicry attack, we propose a novel construction for wireless link signature, called time-synched link signature, by integrating cryptographic protection and time factor into traditional wireless link signatures. We also evaluate the mimicry attacks and the time-synched link signature scheme on the USRP2 platform running GNURadio. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of time-synched link signature.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Yao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0007:Yao", "Peng Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Peng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
