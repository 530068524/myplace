Such image computations constitute a crucial component in typical tools for set-based analysis of hybrid systems and embedded software with polynomial dynamics, which found applications in various engineering domains. One typical example is the computation of all states reachable from a given set in one step by a continuous dynamics described by a differential or difference equation. We propose a new algorithm for over-approximating such images based on the Bernstein expansion of polynomial functions. The images are stored using template polyhedra. Using a prototype implementation, the performance of the algorithm was demonstrated on two practical systems as well as a number of randomly generated examples.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Verimag", "Verimag"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Thao Dang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dang:Thao", "David Salinas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salinas:David"], "pages": 14}
