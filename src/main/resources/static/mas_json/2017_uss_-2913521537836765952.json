{"title": "CHAINIAC: Proactive Software-Update Transparency via Collectively Signed Skipchains and Verified Builds.", "fields": ["key", "database", "timeline", "overhead", "computer science", "transparency", "single point of failure", "software"], "abstract": "Software-update mechanisms are critical to the security of modern systems, but their typically centralized design presents a lucrative and frequently attacked target. In this work, we propose CHAINIAC, a decentralized software-update framework that eliminates single points of failure, enforces transparency, and provides efficient verifiability of integrity and authenticity for software-release processes. Independent witness servers collectively verify conformance of software updates to release policies, build verifiers validate the source-to-binary correspondence, and a tamper-proof release log stores collectively signed updates, thus ensuring that no release is accepted by clients before being widely disclosed and validated. The release log embodies a skipchain, a novel data structure, enabling arbitrarily out-of-date clients to efficiently validate updates and signing keys. Evaluation of our CHAINIAC prototype on reproducible Debian packages shows that the automated update process takes the average of 5 minutes per release for individual packages, and only 20 seconds for the aggregate timeline. We further evaluate the framework using real-world data from the PyPI package repository and show that it offers clients security comparable to verifying every single update themselves while consuming only one-fifth of the bandwidth and having a minimal computational overhead.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Kirill Nikitin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikitin:Kirill", "Eleftherios Kokoris-Kogias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kokoris=Kogias:Eleftherios", "Philipp Jovanovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jovanovic:Philipp", "Nicolas Gailly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gailly:Nicolas", "Linus Gasser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gasser:Linus", "Ismail Khoffi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoffi:Ismail", "Justin Cappos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cappos:Justin", "Bryan Ford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ford:Bryan"], "pages": 17}
