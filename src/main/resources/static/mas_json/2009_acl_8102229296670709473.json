Successful reconstruction of this text would transform these errorful utterances into fluent strings and offer an alternate mechanism for analysis.\n\nOur investigation of naturally-occurring spontaneous speaker errors aligned to corrected text with manual semantico-syntactic analysis yields new insight into the syntactic and structural semantic differences between spoken and reconstructed language.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Yale University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Erin Fitzgerald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fitzgerald:Erin", "Frederick Jelinek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jelinek:Frederick", "Robert Frank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frank:Robert"], "pages": 9}
