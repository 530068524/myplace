At the same time, they require high current and high voltages to switch cell states. Their working voltages are provided by CMOS-compatible on-chip charge pumps (CPs). Unfortunately, CPs and particularly those for RESET, have a large parasitic power (a dominant component in total power loss) during operations, which significantly degrades their energy efficiency. In addition, CPs seriously suffer from the Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) problem due to their boosted operation voltage. To maintain a reasonable lifetime of CPs, existing solutions actively switch them on per-operation basis, resulting in large performance degradation   In this paper, we address the above issues through two designs --- Reset_Sch (RESET scheduling) and CP_Sch (CP scheduling). Reset_Sch schedules when to perform a RESET for different cells upon writing a PCM line. It significantly reduces the power loss, and peak working power of RESET CP. CP_Sch incorporates a fast READ CP design to provide fast charge-up time for reads and minimize performance penalty. Our experimental results show that on average, 70% of power loss for RESET CP can be reduced; and performance loss can be reduced from 16% to 2% while achieving a 16% improvement in reliability", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Lei Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0001:Lei", "Bo Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0007:Bo", "Jun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Jun", "Youtao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Youtao"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
