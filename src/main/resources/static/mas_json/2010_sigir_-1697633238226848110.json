{"title": "A content based approach for discovering missing anchor text for web search.", "fields": ["language model", "hyperlink", "terabyte", "backlink", "anchor text"], "abstract": "Although anchor text provides very useful information for web search, a large portion of web pages have few or no incoming hyperlinks (anchors), which is known as the anchor text sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose a language modeling based technique for overcoming anchor text sparsity by discovering a web page's plausible missing anchor text from its similar web pages' in-link anchor text. We design experiments with two publicly available TREC web corpora (GOV2 and ClueWeb09) to evaluate different approaches for discovering missing anchor text. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively discover plausible missing anchor terms. We then use the web named page finding task in the TREC Terabyte track to explore the utility of missing anchor text information discovered by our approach for helping retrieval. Experimental results show that our approach can statistically significantly improve retrieval performance, compared with several approaches that only use anchor text aggregated over the web graph.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Xing Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Xing", "James Allan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allan:James"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
