Despite of the impressive top-5 accuracies achieved by existing methods, their top-1 accuracies are not very satisfactory. The reasons are in two-fold: (1) existing similarity measures are sensitive to object pose and scale changes, as well as intra-class variations, and (2) effectively fusing RGB and depth cues is still an open problem. To address these problems, this paper first proposes a new similarity measure based on dense matching, through which objects in comparison are warped and aligned, to better tolerate variations. Towards RGB and depth fusion, we argue that a constant and golden weight doesn't exist. The two modalities have varying contributions when comparing objects from different categories. To capture such a dynamic characteristic, a group of matchers equipped with various fusion weights is constructed, to explore the responses of dense matching under different fusion configurations. All the response scores are finally merged following a learning-to-combination way, which provides quite good generalization ability in practice. The proposed approach win the best results on several public benchmarks, e.g., achieves 92.7% top-1 test accuracy on the Washington RGB-D object dataset, with a 5.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Microsoft", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Microsoft", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yanhua Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Yanhua", "Rui Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Rui", "Chi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chi", "Zhiwei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhiwei", "Xin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xin", "Kaiqi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Kaiqi", "Yong Rui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rui:Yong"], "pages": 9}
