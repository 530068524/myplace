Compared to CPU-based commodity systems, our solution shows distinctive advantages for stream monitoring tasks, e.g., wire-speed processing and predictable performance. The demonstration is based on a query-to-hardware compiler for complex event patterns that we presented at VLDB 2010 [1]. By example of a click stream monitoring application, we illustrate the inner workings of our compiler and indicate how FPGAs can act as efficient and reliable processors for event streams.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Louis Woods.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woods:Louis", "Jens Teubner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teubner:Jens", "Gustavo Alonso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alonso:Gustavo"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
