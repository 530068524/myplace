{"title": "DIPBench Toolsuite: A Framework for Benchmarking Integration Systems.", "fields": ["job shop scheduling", "xml", "benchmarking", "benchmark", "data warehouse"], "abstract": "So far the optimization of integration processes between heterogeneous data sources is still an open challenge. A first step towards sufficient techniques was the specification of a universal benchmark for integration systems. This DIPBench allows to compare solutions under controlled conditions and would help generate interest in this research area. However, we see the requirement for providing a sophisticated toolsuite in order to minimize the effort for benchmark execution. This demo illustrates the use of the DIPBench toolsuite. We show the macro-architecture as well as the micro-architecture of each tool. Furthermore, we also present the first reference benchmark implementation using a federated DBMS. Thereby, we discuss the impact of the defined benchmark scale factors. Finally, we want to give guidance on how to benchmark other integration systems and how to extend the toolsuite with new distribution functions or other functionalities.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Matthias B\u00f6hm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hm_0001:Matthias", "Dirk Habich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habich:Dirk", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang", "Uwe Wloka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wloka:Uwe"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
