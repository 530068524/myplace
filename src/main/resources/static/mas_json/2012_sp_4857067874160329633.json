{"title": "LAP: Lightweight Anonymity and Privacy.", "fields": ["latency", "adversary model", "anonymity", "stateless protocol", "low latency"], "abstract": "Popular anonymous communication systems often require sending packets through a sequence of relays on dilated paths for strong anonymity protection. As a result, increased end-to-end latency renders such systems inadequate for the majority of Internet users who seek an intermediate level of anonymity protection while using latency-sensitive applications, such as Web applications. This paper serves to bridge the gap between communication systems that provide strong anonymity protection but with intolerable latency and non-anonymous communication systems by considering a new design space for the setting. More specifically, we explore how to achieve near-optimal latency while achieving an intermediate level of anonymity with a weaker yet practical adversary model (i.e., protecting an end-host's identity and location from servers) such that users can choose between the level of anonymity and usability. We propose Lightweight Anonymity and Privacy (LAP), an efficient network-based solution featuring lightweight path establishment and stateless communication, by concealing an end-host's topological location to enhance anonymity against remote tracking. To show practicality, we demonstrate that LAP can work on top of the current Internet and proposed future Internet architectures.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "KDDI"], "authors": ["Hsu-Chun Hsiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsiao:Hsu=Chun", "Tiffany Hyun-Jin Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Tiffany_Hyun=Jin", "Adrian Perrig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perrig:Adrian", "Akira Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Akira", "Samuel C.
