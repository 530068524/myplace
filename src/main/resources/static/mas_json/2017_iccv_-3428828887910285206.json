In this paper, we propose a method which does not require manual annotations and is instead cued by observing objects from a moving vantage point. Our system builds on two innovations: a Siamese viewpoint factorization network that robustly aligns different videos together without explicitly comparing 3D shapes; and a 3D shape completion network that can extract the full shape of an object from partial observations. We also demonstrate the benefits of configuring networks to perform probabilistic predictions as well as of geometry-aware data augmentation schemes. We obtain state-of-the-art results on publicly-available benchmarks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Xerox", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Xerox", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["David Novotn\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novotn=yacute=:David", "Diane Larlus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larlus:Diane", "Andrea Vedaldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vedaldi:Andrea"], "pages": 10}
