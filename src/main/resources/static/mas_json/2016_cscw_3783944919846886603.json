In this paper, we discuss temporality as a factor in the design of health information technology. We define a temporal spectrum ranging from time-critical services that benefit from standardization to long-term services that require more flexibility. We provide empirical evidence from fieldwork that we performed in organizations providing long-term behavioral and mental health services for children. Our fieldwork in this context complements and provides contrasts to previous CSCW studies performed in time-critical hospital settings. Current literature shows a bias toward standardized records and routines in the implementation of health information technology, a policy that may not be appropriate for long-term health services. We discuss how the design of information systems should vary based on temporal factors.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Gabriela Marcu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marcu:Gabriela", "Sara B.
