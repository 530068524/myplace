As part of our work, we introduce the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE), a fully annotated one million words corpus of learner English available for research purposes. We conduct an extensive evaluation for article and preposition errors using various feature sets. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms two baselines trained on non-learner text and learner text, respectively. Our approach also outperforms two commercial grammar checking software packages.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "NUS Graduate Sc ... nd Engineering"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Daniel Dahlmeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dahlmeier:Daniel", "Hwee Tou Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Hwee_Tou"], "pages": 9}
