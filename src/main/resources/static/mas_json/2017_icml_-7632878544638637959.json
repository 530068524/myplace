Recently, \\emph{multi-fidelity} methods have garnered considerable attention since function evaluations have become increasingly expensive in such applications. Multi-fidelity methods use cheap approximations to the function of interest to speed up the overall optimisation process. However, most multi-fidelity methods assume only a finite number of approximations. In many practical applications however, a continuous spectrum of approximations might be available. For instance, when tuning an expensive neural network, one might choose to approximate the cross validation performance using less data $N$ and/or few training iterations $T$. Here, the approximations are best viewed as arising out of a continuous two dimensional space $(N,T)$. In this work, we develop a Bayesian optimisation method, BOCA, for this setting. We characterise its theoretical properties and show that it achieves better regret than than strategies which ignore the approximations. BOCA outperforms several other baselines in synthetic and real experiments.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Rice University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Kirthevasan Kandasamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kandasamy:Kirthevasan", "Gautam Dasarathy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasarathy:Gautam", "Jeff G.
