{"title": "Random tree walk toward instantaneous 3D human pose estimation.", "fields": ["random walk", "single core", "pose", "random tree", "frame rate"], "abstract": "The availability of accurate depth cameras have made real-time human pose estimation possible; however, there are still demands for faster algorithms on low power processors. This paper introduces 1000 frames per second pose estimation method on a single core CPU. A large computation gain is achieved by random walk sub-sampling. Instead of training trees for pixel-wise classification, a regression tree is trained to estimate the probability distribution to the direction toward the particular joint, relative to the current position. At test time, the direction for the random walk is randomly chosen from a set of representative directions. The new position is found by a constant step toward the direction, and the distribution for next direction is found at the new position. The continual random walk through 3D space will eventually produce an expectation of step positions, which we estimate as the joint position. A regression tree is built separately for each joint. The number of random walk steps can be assigned for each joint so that the computation time is consistent regardless of the size of body segmentation. The experiments show that even with large computation gain, the accuracy is higher or comparable to the state-of-the-art pose estimation methods.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Ajou University", "Div. of Comp. & ...
