A key challenge in concolic testing is how to effectively explore the program's execution paths to achieve high code coverage in a limited time budget. Concolic testing employs a search heuristic to address this challenge, which favors exploring particular types of paths that are most likely to maximize the final coverage. However, manually designing a good search heuristic is nontrivial and typically ends up with suboptimal and unstable outcomes. The goal of this paper is to overcome this shortcoming of concolic testing by automatically generating search heuristics. We define a class of search heuristics, namely a parameterized heuristic, and present an algorithm that efficiently finds an optimal heuristic for each subject program. Experimental results with open-source C programs show that our technique successfully generates search heuristics that significantly outperform existing manually-crafted heuristics in terms of branch coverage and bug-finding.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Korea University", "Korea University", "Korea University", "Korea University"], "authors": ["Sooyoung Cha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cha:Sooyoung", "Seongjoon Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Seongjoon", "Junhee Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Junhee", "Hakjoo Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Hakjoo"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
