{"title": "Exploiting both Vertical and Horizontal Dimensions of Feature Hierarchy for Effective Recommendation.", "fields": ["horizontal and vertical", "hierarchy", "exploit", "data mining", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Feature hierarchy (FH) has proven to be effective to improve recommendation accuracy. Prior work mainly focuses on the influence of vertically affiliated features (i.e. child-parent) on user-item interactions. The relationships of horizontally organized features (i.e. siblings and cousins) in the hierarchy, however, has only been little investigated.  We show in real-world datasets that feature relationships in horizontal dimension can help explain and further model user-item interactions. To fully exploit FH, we propose a unified recommendation framework that seamlessly incorporates both vertical and horizontal dimensions for effective recommendation. Our model further considers two types of semantically rich feature relationships in horizontal dimension, i.e. complementary and alternative relationships. Extensive validation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach against the state of the art. An additional benefit of our model is to provide better interpretations of the generated recommendations.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Delft University of Technology", "Nanyang Technological University", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Zhu Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Zhu", "Jie Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0028:Jie", "Jie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Jie", "Alessandro Bozzon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bozzon:Alessandro"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
