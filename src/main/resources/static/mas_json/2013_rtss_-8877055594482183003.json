Electricity price is market-based and dynamic. In this paper, we inves- tigate how to cut the electricity bills of commercial buildings in a dynamic power market. The building thermal systems (e.g., air-conditioning), which dominate electricity bills, has a special property of thermal storage, i.e., the energy will not immediately dissipate from thermal air/water. Intuitively, with storage, the energy can be \"stored\" in the thermal system, making it possible to purchase electricity in low price and use it at appropriate time. The building thermal supply and electricity purchasing surely depends on human activities that the building should support such as class and meeting schedules. To minimize electricity bills, we develop a holistic planning of electricity purchasing schedule with thermal stor- age management, and appropriate room assignment schedules for classes/meetings usage. The computing algorithms require inputs of physical mod- eling on energy consumption. We develop wireless sensing systems to collect one-grained data which are used to assist the cross-disciplinary physical modeling. We conduct valida- tion through real experiments. We formulate an optimization problem and show that it is NP-complete. Our primary focus is to minimize electricity bills, which matches the incentives of the commercial buildings. We show that this does not coincide with energy conservation. We further investigate the relationship of minimization of electricity bills and minimization of energy consumption. We develop algorithms for our problem and our evaluation shows that we can achieve a 40% cost reduction.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Dawei Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Dawei", "Dan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Dan", "Jiannong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Jiannong", "Yu Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Yu", "Xiyuan Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Xiyuan"], "pages": 11}
