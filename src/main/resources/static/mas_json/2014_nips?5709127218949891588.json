A complementary research strategy is to develop alternative modeling architectures that admit efficient training methods while expanding the range of representable structures toward deep models. In this paper, we develop a new architecture for nested nonlinearities that allows arbitrarily deep compositions to be trained to global optimality. The approach admits both parametric and nonparametric forms through the use of normalized kernels to represent each latent layer. The outcome is a fully convex formulation that is able to capture compositions of trainable nonlinear layers to arbitrary depth.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "NICTA", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["\u00d6zlem Aslan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aslan:=Ouml=zlem", "Xinhua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinhua", "Dale Schuurmans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuurmans:Dale"], "pages": 9}
