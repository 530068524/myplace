To harness this capability, spectrum sensing is a fundamental problem for DSA networks. This demonstration shows our wideband compressed spectrum sensing (WCSS) platform. This platform supports the controllable spectrum environment, high performance and low cost wideband spectrum sensing based USRP2, powerful and flexible compressed sensing computing platform based MATLAB. With this platform, we can research the wideband compressed spectrum sensing algorithm by actual and controllable spectrum environment.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Qiang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qiang", "Ze Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Ze", "Li Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Li"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
