We create a cross-view hamming space with the ability to compare information from previously incomparable domains with a notion of 'predictability'. By performing comparative experimental analysis on two large datasets, PASCAL-Sentence and SUN-Attribute, we demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state-of-the-art dual-view binary code learning algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Mohammad Rastegari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rastegari:Mohammad", "Jonghyun Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jonghyun", "Shobeir Fakhraei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fakhraei:Shobeir", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal", "Larry S.
