{"title": "Labeling Complicated Objects: Multi-View Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "bayesian network", "inference", "feature vector", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Multi-Instance Multi-Label (MIML) is a learning framework where an example is associated with multiple labels and represented by a set of feature vectors (multiple instances). In the formalization of MIML learning, instances come from a single source (single view). To leverage multiple information sources (multi-view), we develop a multi-view MIML framework based on hierarchical Bayesian Network, and derive an effective learning algorithm based on variational inference. The model can naturally deal with examples in which some views could be absent (partial examples). On multi-view datasets, it is shown that our method is better than other multi-view and single-view approaches particularly in the presence of partial examples. On single-view benchmarks, extensive evaluation shows that our method is highly competitive or better than other MIML approaches on labeling examples and instances. Moreover, our method can effectively handle datasets with a large number of labels.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore", "Nanjing University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Cam-Tu Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Cam=Tu", "Xiaoliang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaoliang", "Jing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Jing", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
