{"title": "Projective Arithmetic Functional Encryption and Indistinguishability Obfuscation from Degree-5 Multilinear Maps.", "fields": ["ciphertext indistinguishability", "obfuscation", "functional encryption", "projective test", "multilinear map"], "abstract": "In this work, we propose a variant of functional encryption called projective arithmetic functional encryption (PAFE). Roughly speaking, our notion is like functional encryption for arithmetic circuits, but where secret keys only yield partially decrypted values. These partially decrypted values can be linearly combined with known coefficients and the result can be tested to see if it is a small value.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Prabhanjan Ananth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ananth:Prabhanjan", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit"], "pages": 30}
