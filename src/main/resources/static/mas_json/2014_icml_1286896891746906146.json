Unfortunately, such optimization is hard since simple operations on orthogonal matrices easily break orthogonality, and correcting orthogonality usually costs a large amount of computation.\n\nHere we propose a framework for optimizing orthogonal matrices, that is the parallel of coordinate-descent in Euclidean spaces. It is based on Givens-rotations, a fast-to-compute operation that affects a small number of entries in the learned matrix, and preserves orthogonality.\n\nWe show two applications of this approach: an algorithm for tensor decompositions used in learning mixture models, and an algorithm for sparse-PCA. We study the parameter regime where a Givens rotation approach converges faster and achieves a superior model on a genome-wide brain-wide mRNA expression dataset.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Bar-Ilan University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Uri Shalit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalit:Uri", "Gal Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Gal"], "pages": 9}
