{"title": "Onix: A Distributed Control Platform for Large-scale Production Networks.", "fields": ["implementation", "routing control plane", "real time computing", "scalability", "durability"], "abstract": "Computer networks lack a general control paradigm, as traditional networks do not provide any network-wide management abstractions. As a result, each new function (such as routing) must provide its own state distribution, element discovery, and failure recovery mechanisms. We believe this lack of a common control platform has significantly hindered the development of flexible, reliable and feature-rich network control planes.\n\nTo address this, we present Onix, a platform on top of which a network control plane can be implemented as a distributed system. Control planes written within Onix operate on a global view of the network, and use basic state distribution primitives provided by the platform. Thus Onix provides a general API for control plane implementations, while allowing them to make their own trade-offs among consistency, durability, and scalability.", "citation": "Citations (1,325)", "departments": ["Google", "Nicira Networks", "Nicira Networks", "Nicira Networks", "Nicira Networks"], "authors": ["Teemu Koponen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koponen:Teemu", "Mart\u00edn Casado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casado:Mart=iacute=n", "Natasha Gude.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gude:Natasha", "Jeremy Stribling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stribling:Jeremy", "Leon Poutievski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poutievski:Leon", "Min Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Min", "Rajiv Ramanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanathan:Rajiv", "Yuichiro Iwata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwata:Yuichiro", "Hiroaki Inoue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inoue:Hiroaki", "Takayuki Hama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hama:Takayuki", "Scott Shenker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shenker:Scott"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2010", "pages": 14}
