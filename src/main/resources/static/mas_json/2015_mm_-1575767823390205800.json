{"title": "Socializing Multimodal Sensors for Information Fusion.", "fields": ["streams", "fusion", "situation awareness", "socialization", "big data"], "abstract": "In the modern big data world, development of a huge number of physical or social sensors provides us a great opportunity to explore both cyber and physical situation awareness. However, social sensor fusion for situation awareness is still in its infancy and lacks a unified framework to aggregate and composite real-time media streams from diverse sensors and social network platforms. We propose a new paradigm where sensor and social information are fused together facilitating event detection or customized services. Our proposal consists of 1) a tweeting camera framework where cameras can tweet event related information; 2) a hybrid social sensor fusion algorithm utilizing spatio-temporal-semantic information from multimodal sensors and 3) a new social-cyber-physical paradigm where human and sensors are collaborating for event fusion. Our research progress and preliminary results are presented and future directions are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yuhui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuhui"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
