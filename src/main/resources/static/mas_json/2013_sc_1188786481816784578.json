We establish the theoretical proof of the correctness and the numerical stability of the approach in the context of a Hessenberg Reduction (HR) and present the scalability and performance results of a practical implementation. Our method is a hybrid algorithm combining an Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) technique with diskless checkpointing to fully protect the data. We protect the trailing and the initial part of the matrix with checksums, and protect finished panels in the panel scope with diskless checkpoints. Compared with the original HR (the ScaLAPACK  PDGEHRD  routine) our fault-tolerant algorithm introduces very little overhead, and maintains the same level of scalability. We prove that the overhead shows a decreasing trend as the size of the matrix or the size of the process grid increases.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee", "University of Tennessee"], "authors": ["Yulu Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yulu", "George Bosilca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosilca:George", "Piotr Luszczek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luszczek:Piotr", "Jack J.
