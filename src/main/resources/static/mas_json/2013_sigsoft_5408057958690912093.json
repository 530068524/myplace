The framework is meant for defining the dynamic semantics of DSLs and allows for mapping the DSL definition to the various platforms, such as verification, validation and simulation. The objectives of the project are to make a DSL dynamic semantics definition explicit and to use this definition for bridging technological diversity of various platforms, used in the DSLs development.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology"], "authors": ["Ulyana Tikhonova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tikhonova:Ulyana"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
