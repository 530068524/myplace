SEC is based on the observation that the cluster assignment matrix of high dimensional data can be represented by a low dimensional linear mapping of data. We also discover the connection between SEC and other clustering methods, such as spectral clustering, Clustering with local and global regularization, K-means and Discriminative K-means. The experiments on many real-world data sets show that SEC significantly out-performs the existing spectral clustering methods as well as K-means clustering related methods.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Dong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Dong", "Ivor W.
