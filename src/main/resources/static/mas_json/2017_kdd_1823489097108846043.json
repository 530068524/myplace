{"title": "FLAP: An End-to-End Event Log Analysis Platform for System Management.", "fields": ["analytics", "systems management", "automatic summarization", "end to end principle", "use case"], "abstract": "Many systems, such as distributed operating systems, complex networks, and high throughput web-based applications, are continuously generating large volume of event logs. These logs contain useful information to help system administrators to understand the system running status and to pinpoint the system failures. Generally, due to the scale and complexity of modern systems, the generated logs are beyond the analytic power of human beings. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive log analysis system to support effective system management. Although a number of log mining techniques have been proposed to address specific log analysis use cases, few research and industrial efforts have been paid on providing integrated systems with an end-to-end solution to facilitate the log analysis routines.   In this paper, we design and implement an integrated system, called  FIU Log Analysis Platform  (a.k.a. FLAP), that aims to facilitate the data analytics for system event logs. FLAP provides an end-to-end solution that utilizes advanced data mining techniques to assist log analysts to conveniently, timely, and accurately conduct event log knowledge discovery, system status investigation, and system failure diagnosis. Specifically, in FLAP, state-of-the-art template learning techniques are used to extract useful information from unstructured raw logs; advanced data transformation techniques are proposed and leveraged for event transformation and storage; effective event pattern mining, event summarization, event querying, and failure prediction techniques are designed and integrated for log analytics; and user-friendly interfaces are utilized to present the informative analysis results intuitively and vividly. Since 2016, FLAP has been used by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd for internal event log analysis, and has provided effective support in its system operation and workflow optimization.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"], "authors": ["Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Tao", "Yexi Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yexi", "Chunqiu Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Chunqiu", "Bin Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Bin", "Zheng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zheng", "Wubai Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Wubai", "Xiaolong Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaolong", "Wentao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0006:Wentao", "Liang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Liang", "Jun Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jun", "Li Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Li", "Dewei Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Dewei"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
