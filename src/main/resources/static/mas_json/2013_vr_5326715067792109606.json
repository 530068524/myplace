One was an AR evaluation prototype system used to design the aircraft cockpit. In this system, the pilots can touch the virtual buttons and meters to test the ergonomics performance of design results. The other was a touchable AR girl prototype system used to treat heterosexual-social anxiety. In this system, patients can touch and feel a virtual girl. We designed a series of subjective and objective experiments to prove the importance of \u201ctouchable\u201d to enhancing the user experience in AR system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Dong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dong", "Jinghui Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jinghui", "Dongdong Weng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weng:Dongdong", "Yuqian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuqian"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
