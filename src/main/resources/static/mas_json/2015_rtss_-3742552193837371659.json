For each individual task model, researchers tend to develop different types of techniques for deriving schedulability tests with different computation complexity and performance. In this paper, we present a general schedulability analysis framework, namely the k2U framework, that can be potentially applied to analyze a large set of real-time task models under any fixed-priority scheduling algorithm, on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor scheduling. The key to k2U is a k-point effective schedulability test, which can be viewed as a \"blackbox\" interface. For any task model, if a corresponding k-point effective schedulability test can be constructed, then a sufficient utilization-based test can be automatically derived. We show the generality of k2U by applying it to different task models, which results in new and improved tests compared to the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Information Technology University", "Information Technology University", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Jian-Jia Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jian=Jia", "Wen-Hung Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Wen=Hung", "Cong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Cong"], "pages": 12}
