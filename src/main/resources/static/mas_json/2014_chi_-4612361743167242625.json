ACCD reduces the number of explicit viewpoint manipulations by combining self-occlusion management and automated camera control. As such it enables drawing on occluded faces but also around a 3D shape while keeping a constant drawing precision. Our experimental results indicates the efficacy of ACCD over conventional techniques.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "UJF-Grenoble1,  ... renoble, France"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Michael Ortega.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ortega:Michael", "Thomas Vincent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vincent:Thomas"], "pages": 4}
