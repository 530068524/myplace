In the high- integrity application domain it is of paramount importance to assure semantics preservation across each view of the system produced as part of the development process, most notably the design model, the analysis model, the executable. In this short paper we present a toolset that assures the preservation of properties of interest across all stages of an MDE-geared development.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["AdaCore", "University of Padua"], "authors": ["Matteo Bordin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bordin:Matteo", "Marco Panunzio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panunzio:Marco", "Stefano Puri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Puri:Stefano"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
