The key idea is to learn hash functions by maximizing the alignment between the similarity orders computed from the original space and the ones in the hamming space. The problem of mapping the NN points into different hash codes is taken as a classification problem in which the points are categorized into several groups according to the hamming distances to the query. The hash functions are optimized from the classifiers pooled over the training points. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art hashing techniques.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jianfeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jianfeng", "Jingdong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingdong", "Nenghai Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Nenghai", "Shipeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shipeng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
