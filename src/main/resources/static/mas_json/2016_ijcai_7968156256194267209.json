{"title": "Forgetting Concept and Role Symbols in ALCOIH\u00b5", "fields": ["abox", "logical consequence", "ackermann function", "expressivity", "forgetting"], "abstract": "Forgetting is a non-standard reasoning problem concerned with creating restricted views for ontologies relative to subsets of their initial signatures while preserving all logical consequences up to the symbols in the restricted views. In this paper, we present an Ackermann-based approach for forgetting of concept and role symbols in ontologies expressible in the description logic ALCOIH\u00b5+(\u2207, \u2229). The method is one of only few approaches that can eliminate role symbols, that can handle role inverse, ABox statements, and is the only approach so far providing support for forgetting in description logics with nominals. Despite the inherent difficulty of forgetting for this level of expressivity, performance results with a prototypical implementation have shown very good success rates on real-world ontologies.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Manchester", "University of Manchester"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yizheng Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yizheng", "Renate A.
