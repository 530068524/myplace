{"title": "Multi-Variable Agents Decomposition for DCOPs.", "fields": ["distributed constraint optimization", "distributed computing", "parallel computing", "scalability", "limiting", "exploit", "general purpose computing on graphics processing units"], "abstract": "Current DCOP algorithms suffer from a major limiting assumption---each agent can handle only a single variable of the problem---which limits their scalability. This paper proposes a novel Multi-Variable Agent (MVA) DCOP decomposition, which: (i) Exploits co-locality of an agent's variables, allowing us to adopt efficient centralized techniques; (ii) Enables the use of hierarchical parallel models, such us those based on GPGPUs; and (iii) Empirically reduces the amount of communication required in several classes of DCOP algorithms. Experimental results show that our MVA decomposition outperforms non-decomposed DCOP algorithms, in terms of network load and scalability.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["New Mexico State University", "New Mexico State University", "New Mexico State University"], "authors": ["Ferdinando Fioretto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fioretto:Ferdinando", "William Yeoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeoh_0001:William", "Enrico Pontelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pontelli:Enrico"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
