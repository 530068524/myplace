By moderately leveraging the dependency information projected from the parsed counterpart language, and simultaneously mining the underlying syntactic structure of the language considered, it effectively integrates the advantages of bilingual projection and unsupervised induction, so as to induce a monolingual grammar much better than previous models only using bilingual projection or unsupervised induction. We induced dependency grammar for five different languages under the guidance of dependency information projected from the parsed English translation, experiments show that the bilinguallyguided method achieves a significant improvement of 28: 5% over the unsupervised baseline and 3: 0% over the best projection baseline on average.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Dublin City University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kai Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Kai", "Yajuan L\u00fc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=uuml=:Yajuan", "Wenbin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Wenbin", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun"], "pages": 10}
