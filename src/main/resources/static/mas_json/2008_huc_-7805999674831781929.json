Due to the distinct characteristics of the context of shopping (e.g. openness to the public, preexisting technologies), this context is particularly fruitful for UbiComp technologies. The prototype consists of a display showing an enhanced store map, which combines the dynamic visualization of customer activity (e.g. hot-spots, sales ranks) with conventional map elements (e.g. product locations, promotions). The results of our three-day in-situ study indicate the relevance and the usefulness of UbiComp technologies for shopping environments.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg"], "authors": ["Alexander Meschtscherjakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meschtscherjakov:Alexander", "Wolfgang Reitberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reitberger:Wolfgang", "Michael Lankes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lankes:Michael", "Manfred Tscheligi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tscheligi:Manfred"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
