This improves the $n^{O(n)}$ running time of the best previously known algorithms for CVP [R. Kannan, Math. Oper. Res., 12 (1987), pp. 415--440] and SIVP [D. Micciancio, Proceedings of the $19$th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2008, pp. 84--93] and gives a deterministic and asymptotically faster alternative to the $2^{O(n)}$-time (and space) randomized algorithm for SVP of Ajtai, Kumar, and Sivakumar [Proceedings of the $33$rd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2001, pp. 266--275]. The core of our algorithm is a new method to solve the closest vector problem with preprocessing (CVPP) that uses the Voronoi cell of the lattice (described as intersection of half-spaces) as the result of the preproces...", "citation": "Citations (229)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Daniele Micciancio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micciancio:Daniele", "Panagiotis Voulgaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voulgaris:Panagiotis"], "pages": 8}
