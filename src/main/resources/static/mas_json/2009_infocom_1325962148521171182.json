In network timing channels, information is leaked by controlling the time between transmissions of consecutive packets. Our work focuses on network timing channels and provides two main contributions. The first is to quantify the threat posed by covert network timing channels. The other is to use timing channels to communicate at a low data rate without being detected. In this paper, we design and implement a covert TCP/IP timing channel. We are able to quantify the achievable data rate (or leak rate) of such a covert channel. Moreover, we show that by sacrificing data rate, the traffic patterns of the covert timing channel can be made computationally indistinguishable from that of normal traffic, which makes detecting such communication virtually impossible. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solution by showing significant performance gains in terms of both data rate and covertness over the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (126)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Sarah H.
