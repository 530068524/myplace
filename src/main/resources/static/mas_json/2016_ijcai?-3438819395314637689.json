The Orange Labs' Majordomo dialogue system, which allows the users to have conversations within a smart home, has been upgraded to an incremental version. First, a user simulator is built in order to generate a dialogue corpus which thereafter is used to optimise the turn-taking strategy from delayed rewards with the Fitted-Q reinforcement learning algorithm. Real users test and evaluate the new learnt strategy, versus a non-incremental and a handcrafted incremental strategies. The data-driven strategy is shown to significantly improve the task completion ratio and to be preferred by the users according to subjective metrics.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Orange Labs, CERI-LIA", "Orange Labs, Ch ... tillon, France", "CERI-LIA, Avignon, France"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Hatim Khouzaimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khouzaimi:Hatim", "Romain Laroche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laroche:Romain", "Fabrice Lef\u00e8vre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lef=egrave=vre:Fabrice"], "pages": 7}
