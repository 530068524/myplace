{"title": "Bolt-on causal consistency.", "fields": ["geo replication", "eventual consistency", "weak consistency", "causal consistency", "shim"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of separating consistency-related safety properties from availability and durability in distributed data stores via the application of a \"bolt-on\" shim layer that upgrades the safety of an underlying general-purpose data store. This shim provides the same consistency guarantees atop a wide range of widely deployed but often inflexible stores. As causal consistency is one of the strongest consistency models that remain available during system partitions, we develop a shim layer that upgrades eventually consistent stores to provide convergent causal consistency. Accordingly, we leverage widely deployed eventually consistent infrastructure as a common substrate for providing causal guarantees. We describe algorithms and shim implementations that are suitable for a large class of application-level causality relationships and evaluate our techniques using an existing, production-ready data store and with real-world explicit causality relationships.", "citation": "Citations (170)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Royal Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Peter Bailis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailis:Peter", "Ali Ghodsi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghodsi_0002:Ali", "Joseph M.
