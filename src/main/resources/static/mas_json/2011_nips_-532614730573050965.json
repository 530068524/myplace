The optimal Bayesian solution is intractable in general. This paper studies to what extent analytic statements about optimal learning are possible if all beliefs are Gaussian processes. A first order approximation of learning of both loss and dynamics, for nonlinear, time-varying systems in continuous time and space, subject to a relatively weak restriction on the dynamics, is described by an infinite-dimensional partial differential equation. An approximate finite-dimensional projection gives an impression for how this result may be helpful.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Philipp Hennig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hennig:Philipp"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
