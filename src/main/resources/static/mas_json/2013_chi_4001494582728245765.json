Dynamic data introduce challenges for these interfaces, however, as moving objects may exit the detail view, as well as a person's field of view if they are working at a large interactive surface. To address this \"off-view\" problem, we propose a new information visualization technique, called Canyon. This technique attaches a small view of an off-view object, including some surrounding context, to the external boundary of the detail view. The area between the detail view and the region containing the off-view object is virtually \"folded\" to conserve space. A comparison study was conducted contrasting the benefits and limitations of Canyon to an established technique, called Wedge. Canyon was more accurate across a number of tasks, especially more complex tasks, and was comparably efficient.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of A ... ustria, Austria", "University of A ... enberg, Austria"], "authors": ["Alexandra Ion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ion:Alexandra", "Yu-Ling Betty Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yu=Ling_Betty", "Michael Haller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haller:Michael", "Mark S.
