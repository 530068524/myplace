{"title": "MinimaLT: minimal-latency networking through better security.", "fields": ["network packet", "latency", "denial of service attack", "network security", "encryption", "forward secrecy"], "abstract": "MinimaLT is a new network protocol that provides ubiquitous encryption for maximal confidentiality, including protecting packet headers. MinimaLT provides server and user authentication, extensive Denial-of-Service protections, privacy-preserving IP mobility, and fast key erasure. We describe the protocol, demonstrate its performance relative to TLS and unencrypted TCP/IP, and analyze its protections, including its resilience against DoS attacks. By exploiting the properties of its cryptographic protections, MinimaLT is able to eliminate three way handshakes and thus create connections faster than unencrypted TCP/IP.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["United States Military Academy", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["W.
