We focus on contingent negative variation which is elicited in response to concentration. Our results support that our method could correctly detects the user's internal states such as just watching or actively remembering even the external situations were completely same and also CNV is elicited when controlling continuous motion.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Center for Inf. ...
