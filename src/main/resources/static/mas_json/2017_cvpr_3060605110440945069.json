{"title": "Synthesizing Normalized Faces from Facial Identity Features.", "fields": ["image warping", "texture mapping", "solid modeling", "color balance", "invariant"], "abstract": "We present a method for synthesizing a frontal, neutral-expression image of a persons face, given an input face photograph. This is achieved by learning to generate facial landmarks and textures from features extracted from a facial-recognition network. Unlike previous generative approaches, our encoding feature vector is largely invariant to lighting, pose, and facial expression. Exploiting this invariance, we train our decoder network using only frontal, neutral-expression photographs. Since these photographs are well aligned, we can decompose them into a sparse set of landmark points and aligned texture maps. The decoder then predicts landmarks and textures independently and combines them using a differentiable image warping operation. The resulting images can be used for a number of applications, such as analyzing facial attributes, exposure and white balance adjustment, or creating a 3-D avatar.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Google", "Google", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Forrester Cole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cole:Forrester", "David Belanger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belanger:David", "Dilip Krishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnan:Dilip", "Aaron Sarna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarna:Aaron", "Inbar Mosseri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mosseri:Inbar", "William T.
