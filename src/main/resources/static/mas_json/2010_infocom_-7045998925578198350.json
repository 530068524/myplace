We present the algorithm to identify people moving around as they are detected by cameras deployed in the infrastructure. The algorithm uses a correlation metric to develop an ID matching algorithm that can associate people in the scene to their global ID emitted from a wireless accelerometer sensor node worn on their belts. First we conduct a set of preliminary experiments to verify that the quantities of interest easily measurable by off-the-shelf components. We validate our metric and the performance of the proposed ID matching algorithm using simulations on testbed data that also includes a crowded scenario.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University"], "authors": ["Deokwoo Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Deokwoo", "Thiago Teixeira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teixeira:Thiago", "Andreas Savvides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savvides:Andreas"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
