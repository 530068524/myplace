Although a variety of ways to evaluate rankings exist in the literature, here we focus on the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) as it widely used and has a strong theoretical underpinning. In practical recommendation, only items at the top of the ranked list are presented to the users. With this in mind we propose a class of objective functions which primarily represent a smooth surrogate for the real AUC, and in a special case we show how to prioritise the top of the list. This loss is differentiable and is optimised through a carefully designed stochastic gradient-descent-based algorithm which scales linearly with the size of the data. We mitigate sample bias present in the data by sampling observations according to a certain power-law based distribution. In addition, we provide computation results as to the efficacy of the proposed method using synthetic and real data.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "university of lille"], "authors": ["Charanpal Dhanjal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhanjal:Charanpal", "Romaric Gaudel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaudel:Romaric", "St\u00e9phan Cl\u00e9men\u00e7on.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cl=eacute=men=ccedil=on:St=eacute=phan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
