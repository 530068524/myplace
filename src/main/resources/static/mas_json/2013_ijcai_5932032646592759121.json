In this paper we propose a probabilistic multi-label classification model based on novel sparse feature learning. By employing an individual sparsity inducing l1-norm and a group sparsity inducing l2,1-norm, the proposed model has the capacity of capturing both label interdependencies and common predictive model structures. We formulate this sparse norm regularized learning problem as a non-smooth convex optimization problem, and develop a fast proximal gradient algorithm to solve it for an optimal solution. Our empirical study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method on a set of multi-label tasks given a limited number of labeled training instances.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yuhong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yuhong", "Wei Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Wei"], "pages": 7}
