{"title": "RAD: A Scalable Framework for Annotator Development.", "fields": ["inverted index", "annotation", "speedup", "indexer", "semantic search"], "abstract": "Developments in semantic search technology have motivated the need for efficient and scalable entity annotation techniques. We demonstrate RAD: a tool for Rapid Annotator Development on a document collection. RAD builds on a recent approach (Ramakrishnan et al., 2006) that translates entity annotation rules into equivalent operations on the inverted index of the collection, to directly generate an annotation index (which can be used in search applications). To make the framework scalable, we use an industrial strength indexer, Lucene (http://lucene.apache.org) and introduce some modifications to its API. The index also serves as a suitable representation for making quick comparisons with an indexed ground truth of annotations on the same collection to evaluate precision and recall of the annotations. RAD achieves at least an order of magnitude speedup over the standard approach of annotating a document-at-a-time as adopted by GATE (Cunnignham et al., 2002). The speedup factor increases with increase in the size of the collection, making RAD scalable. We cache intermediate results from the index operations, enabling quick update of the annotation index as well as speedy evaluation when rules are modified. This makes RAD suitable for rapid and interactive development of annotators.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "India Subsidiar ...
