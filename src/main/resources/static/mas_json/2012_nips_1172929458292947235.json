It has been successfully applied to many applications including computer vision and biomedical informatics. Most of the existing multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms are formulated as a convex sparse regularization problem, which is usually suboptimal, due to its looseness for approximating an l0-type regularizer. In this paper, we propose a non-convex formulation for multi-task sparse feature learning based on a novel nonconvex regularizer. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a Multi-Stage Multi-Task Feature Learning (MSMTFL) algorithm; we also provide intuitive interpretations, detailed convergence and reproducibility analysis for the proposed algorithm. Moreover, we present a detailed theoretical analysis showing that MSMTFL achieves a better parameter estimation error bound than the convex formulation. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of MSMTFL in comparison with the state of the art multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Arizona State University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Arizona State University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Pinghua Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Pinghua", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping", "Changshui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changshui"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
