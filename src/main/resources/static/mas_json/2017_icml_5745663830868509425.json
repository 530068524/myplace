Trying different combinations can be quite labor-intensive and time consuming. Recently, researchers have tried to use deep learning algorithms to exploit the landscape of the loss function of the training problem of interest, and learn how to optimize over it in an automatic way. In this paper, we propose a new learning-to-learn model and some useful and practical tricks. Our optimizer outperforms generic, hand-crafted optimization algorithms and state-of-the-art learning-to-learn optimizers by DeepMind in many tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on a number of tasks, including deep MLPs, CNNs, and simple LSTMs.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tsinghua University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Kaifeng Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Kaifeng", "Shunhua Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Shunhua", "Jian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jian"], "pages": 9}
