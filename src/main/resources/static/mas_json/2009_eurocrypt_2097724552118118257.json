We provide the first public key encryption schemes secure against sender corruptions in this setting. The underlying tool is lossy encryption. We then show that no non-interactive or perfectly binding commitment schemes can be proven secure with black-box reductions to standard computational assumptions, but any statistically hiding commitment scheme is secure. Our work thus shows that the situation for encryption schemes is very different from the one for commitment schemes.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "CWI, Amsterdam,"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Dennis Hofheinz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofheinz:Dennis", "Scott Yilek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yilek:Scott"], "pages": 35}
