{"title": "Generating chat bots from web API specifications.", "fields": ["cloud computing", "power user", "internet privacy", "web api", "compiler"], "abstract": "Companies want to offer chat bots to their customers and employees which can answer questions, enable self-service, and showcase their products and services. Implementing and maintaining chat bots by hand costs time and money. Companies typically have web APIs for their services, which are often documented with an API specification. This paper presents a compiler that takes a web API specification written in Swagger and automatically generates a chat bot that helps the user make API calls. The generated bot is self-documenting, using descriptions from the API specification to answer help requests. Unfortunately, Swagger specifications are not always good enough to generate high-quality chat bots. This paper addresses this problem via a novel in-dialogue curation approach: the power user can improve the generated chat bot by interacting with it. The result is then saved back as an API specification. This paper reports on the design and implementation of the chat bot compiler, the in-dialogue curation, and working case studies.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "oopsla", "authors": ["Mandana Vaziri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaziri:Mandana", "Louis Mandel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mandel:Louis", "Avraham Shinnar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shinnar:Avraham", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Sim\u00e9on.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim=eacute=on:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Martin Hirzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirzel:Martin"], "pages": 14}
