{"title": "Quantitative and qualitative methods for human-subject experiments in Virtual and Augmented Reality.", "fields": ["formative assessment", "virtual reality", "augmented reality", "user interface", "usability"], "abstract": "This tutorial is for researchers and engineers, working in the field of Virtual and Augmented Reality, who wish to conduct user-based experiments and/or evaluations for assessing usability. We propose a full-day tutorial presenting both quantitative and qualitative approaches to conducting human-subject experiments. It will cover (1) the basic principles of experimental design and analysis, with an emphasis on human-subject experiments in AR (Swan), and (2) qualitative studies (e.g., formative evaluation methods) for assessing and improving AR user interfaces and user interaction along with lessons learned from conducting many user-based studies (Gabbard). Swan, Gabbard, and other co-presenters have taught pre-cursor versions of this tutorial 11 previous times at IEEE Virtual Reality, IEEE Visualization, and ISMAR. This tutorial was most recently given at ISMAR 2012, where we included updated examples from our research and further expanded upon qualitative approaches for assessing usability and lessons learned from conducting studies. We both have current, active AR human-subject research projects, and if this tutorial is accepted to be presented at VR 2014, we will discuss some of these projects as case studies.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Association for Computing Machinery", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["J.
