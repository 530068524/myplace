{"title": "Multiplicative Weights Update with Constant Step-Size in Congestion Games: Convergence, Limit Cycles and Chaos.", "fields": ["convergence", "multiplicative function", "nash equilibrium", "discrete mathematics", "load balancing"], "abstract": "The Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) method is a ubiquitous meta-algorithm that works as follows: A distribution is maintained on a certain set, and at each step the probability assigned to action $\\gamma$ is multiplied by $(1 -\\epsilon C(\\gamma))>0$ where $C(\\gamma)$ is the ``cost\" of action $\\gamma$ and then rescaled to ensure that the new values form a distribution. We analyze MWU in congestion games where agents use \\textit{arbitrary admissible constants} as learning rates $\\epsilon$ and prove convergence to \\textit{exact Nash equilibria}. Interestingly, this convergence result does not carry over to the nearly homologous MWU variant where at each step the probability assigned to action $\\gamma$ is multiplied by $(1 -\\epsilon)^{C(\\gamma)}$ even for the simplest case of two-agent, two-strategy load balancing games, where such dynamics can provably lead to limit cycles or even chaotic behavior.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "SUTD"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Gerasimos Palaiopanos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palaiopanos:Gerasimos", "Ioannis Panageas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panageas:Ioannis", "Georgios Piliouras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piliouras:Georgios"], "pages": 11}
