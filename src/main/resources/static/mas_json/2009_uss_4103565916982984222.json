{"title": "Crying Wolf: An Empirical Study of SSL Warning Effectiveness.", "fields": ["empirical research", "internet privacy", "the internet", "computer security", "certificate"], "abstract": "Web users are shown an invalid certificate warning when their browser cannot validate the identity of the websites they are visiting. While these warnings often appear in benign situations, they can also signal a man-in-the-middle attack. We conducted a survey of over 400 Internet users to examine their reactions to and understanding of current SSL warnings. We then designed two new warnings using warnings science principles and lessons learned from the survey. We evaluated warnings used in three popular web browsers and our two warnings in a 100- participant, between-subjects laboratory study. Our warnings performed significantly better than existing warnings, but far too many participants exhibited dangerous behavior in all warning conditions. Our results suggest that, while warnings can be improved, a better approach may be to minimize the use of SSL warnings altogether by blocking users from making unsafe connections and eliminating warnings in benign situations.", "citation": "Citations (403)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Joshua Sunshine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sunshine:Joshua", "Serge Egelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egelman:Serge", "Hazim Almuhimedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almuhimedi:Hazim", "Neha Atri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atri:Neha", "Lorrie Faith Cranor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cranor:Lorrie_Faith"], "pages": 18}
