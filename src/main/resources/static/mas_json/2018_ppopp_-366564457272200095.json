{"title": "Practical concurrent traversals in search trees.", "fields": ["tree traversal", "correctness", "snapshot", "avl tree", "search tree"], "abstract": "Operations of concurrent objects often employ optimistic concurrency-control schemes that consist of a traversal followed by a validation step. The validation checks if concurrent mutations interfered with the traversal to determine if the operation should proceed or restart. A fundamental challenge is to discover a  necessary  and sufficient validation check that has to be performed to guarantee correctness.   In this paper, we show a necessary and sufficient condition for validating traversals in search trees. The condition relies on a new concept of  succinct path snapshots , which are derived from and embedded in the structure of the tree. We leverage the condition to design a general lock-free membership test suitable for any search tree. We then show how to integrate the validation condition in update operations of (non-rebalancing) binary search trees, internal and external, and AVL trees. We experimentally show that our new algorithms outperform existing ones.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Dana Drachsler-Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drachsler=Cohen:Dana", "Martin T.
