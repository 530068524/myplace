{"title": "Temporal Capabilities: Access Control for Time.", "fields": ["access control", "virtual machine", "functional dependency", "virtualization", "limiting"], "abstract": "Embedded systems are increasingly required to handle code of various qualities that must often be isolated, yet predictably share resources. This has motivated the isolation of, for example, mission-critical code from best-effort features using isolation structures such as virtualization. Such systems usually focus on limiting interference between subsystems, which complicates the increasingly common functional dependencies between them. Though isolation must be paramount, the fundamental goal of efficiently sharing hardware motivates a principled mechanism for cooperating between subsystems. This paper introduces Temporal Capabilities (TCaps) which integrate CPU management into a capability-based access-control system and distribute authority for scheduling. In doing so, the controlled temporal coordination between subsystems becomes a first-class concern of the system. By enabling temporal delegations to accompany activations and requests for service, we apply TCaps to a virtualization environment with a shared VM for orchestrating I/O. We show that TCaps, unlike prioritizations and carefully chosen budgets, both meet deadlines for a hard real-time subsystem, and maintain high throughput for a best-effort subsystem.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["George Washington University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Phani Kishore Gadepalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gadepalli:Phani_Kishore", "Robert Gifford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gifford:Robert", "Lucas Baier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baier:Lucas", "Michael Kelly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelly:Michael", "Gabriel Parmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parmer:Gabriel"], "pages": 12}
