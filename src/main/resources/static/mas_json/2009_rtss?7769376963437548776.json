{"title": "Component-Based Abstraction Refinement for Timed Controller Synthesis.", "fields": ["implementation", "refinement calculus", "on the fly", "controller", "solver"], "abstract": "We present a novel technique for synthesizing controllers for distributed real-time environments with safety requirements. Our approach is an abstraction refinement extension to the on-the-fly algorithm by Cassez et al. from 2005. Based on partial compositions of some environment components, each refinement cycle constructs a sound abstraction that can be used to obtain under- and over-approximations of all valid controller implementations. This enables (1) early termination if an implementation does not exist in the over-approximation, or, if one does exist in the under-approximation, and (2) pruning of irrelevant moves in subsequent refinement cycles. In our refinement loop, the precision of the abstractions incrementally increases and converges to all specification-critical components. We implemented our approach in a prototype synthesis tool and evaluated it on an industrial benchmark. In comparison with the timed game solver UPPAAL-Tiga, our technique outperforms the nonincremental approach by an order of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "Reactive Syst.  ... rucken, Germany"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Hans-J\u00f6rg Peter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peter:Hans=J=ouml=rg", "Robert Mattm\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mattm=uuml=ller:Robert"], "pages": 11}
