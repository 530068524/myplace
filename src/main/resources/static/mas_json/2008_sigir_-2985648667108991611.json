{"title": "Predicting information seeker satisfaction in community question answering.", "fields": ["information seeking", "interface design", "question answering", "user intent", "ranking"], "abstract": "Question answering communities such as Naver and Yahoo! Answers have emerged as popular, and often effective, means of information seeking on the web. By posting questions for other participants to answer, information seekers can obtain specific answers to their questions. Users of popular portals such as Yahoo! Answers already have submitted millions of questions and received hundreds of millions of answers from other participants. However, it may also take hours --and sometime days-- until a satisfactory answer is posted. In this paper we introduce the problem of predicting information seeker satisfaction in collaborative question answering communities, where we attempt to predict whether a question author will be satisfied with the answers submitted by the community participants. We present a general prediction model, and develop a variety of content, structure, and community-focused features for this task. Our experimental results, obtained from a largescale evaluation over thousands of real questions and user ratings, demonstrate the feasibility of modeling and predicting asker satisfaction. We complement our results with a thorough investigation of the interactions and information seeking patterns in question answering communities that correlate with information seeker satisfaction. Our models and predictions could be useful for a variety of applications such as user intent inference, answer ranking, interface design, and query suggestion and routing.", "citation": "Citations (286)", "departments": ["Emory University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Emory University"], "authors": ["Yandong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yandong", "Jiang Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Jiang", "Eugene Agichtein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agichtein:Eugene"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
