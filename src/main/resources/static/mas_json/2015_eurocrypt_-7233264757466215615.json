Technically, we achieve KDM-CCA security by enhancing a chosen ciphertext secure scheme based on the high entropy hash proof system with three tools: a key-dependent message encoding, an entropy filter and an authenticated encryption secure against related-key attacks.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Xianhui Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Xianhui", "Bao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Bao", "Dingding Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Dingding"], "pages": 25}
