{"title": "A Polynomial-time Bicriteria Approximation Scheme for Planar Bisection.", "fields": ["e", "binary logarithm", "planar graph", "bisection", "planar"], "abstract": "Given an undirected graph with edge costs and node weights, the minimum bisection problem asks for a partition of the nodes into two parts of equal weight such that the sum of edge costs between the parts is minimized. We give a polynomial time bicriteria approximation scheme for bisection on planar graphs. Specifically, let W be the total weight of all nodes in a planar graph G. For any constant e > 0, our algorithm outputs a bipartition of the nodes such that each part weighs at most W/2 + e and the total cost of edges crossing the partition is at most (1+e) times the total cost of the optimal bisection. The previously best known approximation for planar minimum bisection, even with unit node weights, was ~O(log n). Our algorithm actually solves a more general problem where the input may include a target weight for the smaller side of the bipartition.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Duke University", "Brown University", "Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Kyle Fox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fox:Kyle", "Philip N.
