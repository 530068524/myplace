In this paper, we propose a distance measure as a principled solution to the two requirements. Unlike the conventional feature vector representation, our approach represents each time series with a summarizing smooth curve in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and therefore translate the distance between time series into distances between curves. Moreover we propose to learn the kernel of this RKHS from a population of time series with discrete observations using Gaussian process-based non-parametric mixed-effect models. Experiments on two vastly different real-world problems show that the proposed distance measure leads to improved classification accuracy over the conventional distance measures.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Oregon Health & Science University", "Oregon Health & Science University", "Oregon Health & Science University", "Oregon Health & Science University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Zhengdong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhengdong", "Todd K.
