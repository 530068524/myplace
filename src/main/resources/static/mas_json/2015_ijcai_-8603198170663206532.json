We aim to integrate the term embedding with the medical domain knowledge for healthcare applications. One advantage of our method is that it is very scalable. Experiments on a dataset with more than 1M term pairs show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline approaches by a large margin.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Chang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Chang", "Liangliang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Liangliang", "Bowen Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Bowen"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
