{"title": "Verifying Security Policies in Multi-agent Workflows with Loops.", "fields": ["information flow", "security policy", "temporal logic", "workflow", "decidability"], "abstract": "We consider the automatic verification of information flow security policies of web-based workflows, such as conference submission systems like EasyChair. Our workflow description language allows for loops, non-deterministic choice, and an unbounded number of participating agents. The information flow policies are specified in a temporal logic for hyperproperties. We show that the verification problem can be reduced to the satisfiability of a formula of first-order linear-time temporal logic, and provide decidability results for relevant classes of workflows and specifications. We report on experimental results obtained with an implementation of our approach on a series of benchmarks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Bernd Finkbeiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finkbeiner:Bernd", "Christian M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0008:Christian", "Helmut Seidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidl:Helmut", "Eugen Zalinescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zalinescu:Eugen"], "pages": 13}
