{"title": "Subspace matching: Unique solution to point matching with geometric constraints.", "fields": ["subspace topology", "point set registration", "linear combination", "integer programming", "convex set"], "abstract": "Finding correspondences between feature points is one of the most relevant problems in the whole set of visual tasks. In this paper we address the problem of matching a feature vector (or a matrix) to a given subspace. Given any vector base of such a subspace, we observe a linear combination of its elements with all entries swapped by an unknown permutation. We prove that such a computationally hard integer problem is uniquely solved in a convex set resulting from relaxing the original problem. Also, if noise is present, based on this result, we provide a robust estimate recurring to a linear programming-based algorithm. We use structure-from-motion and object recognition as motivating examples.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Manuel Marques.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marques:Manuel", "Marko Stosic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stosic:Marko", "Jo\u00e3o Paulo Costeira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costeira:Jo=atilde=o_Paulo"], "pages": 7}
