After introducing the game and research competition challenge, we describe our static board evaluation utilizing learned evaluations of abstract partial Poker hands. Next, we evaluate various time management strategies and search algorithms. Finally, we show experimentally which of our design decisions most significantly accounted for observed performance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Gettysburg College", "Gettysburg College", "Gettysburg College"], "authors": ["Todd W.
