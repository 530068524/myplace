{"title": "Addressing cold start in recommender systems: a semi-supervised co-training algorithm.", "fields": ["cold start", "ensemble learning", "standard algorithms", "predictive modelling", "co training"], "abstract": "Cold start is one of the most challenging problems in recommender systems. In this paper we tackle the cold-start problem by proposing a context-aware semi-supervised co-training method named CSEL. Specifically, we use a factorization model to capture fine-grained user-item context. Then, in order to build a model that is able to boost the recommendation performance by leveraging the context, we propose a semi-supervised ensemble learning algorithm. The algorithm constructs different (weak) prediction models using examples with different contexts and then employs the co-training strategy to allow each (weak) prediction model to learn from the other prediction models. The method has several distinguished advantages over the standard recommendation methods for addressing the cold-start problem. First, it defines a fine-grained context that is more accurate for modeling the user-item preference. Second, the method can naturally support supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, which provides a flexible way to incorporate the unlabeled data.   The proposed algorithms are evaluated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results show that with our method the recommendation accuracy is significantly improved compared to the standard algorithms and the cold-start problem is largely alleviated.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Tsinghua University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Mi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Mi", "Jie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Jie", "Xuchen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xuchen", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
