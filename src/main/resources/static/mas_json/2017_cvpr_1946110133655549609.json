Yet, it is non-trivial to transfer the state-of-the-art image recognition networks to videos as per-frame evaluation is too slow and unaffordable. We present deep feature flow, a fast and accurate framework for video recognition. It runs the expensive convolutional sub-network only on sparse key frames and propagates their deep feature maps to other frames via a flow field. It achieves significant speedup as flow computation is relatively fast. The end-to-end training of the whole architecture significantly boosts the recognition accuracy. Deep feature flow is flexible and general. It is validated on two recent large scale video datasets. It makes a large step towards practical video recognition. Code would be released.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xizhou Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xizhou", "Yuwen Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Yuwen", "Jifeng Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Jifeng", "Lu Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Lu", "Yichen Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Yichen"], "pages": 10}
