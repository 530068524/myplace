{"title": "MovieQA: Understanding Stories in Movies through Question-Answering.", "fields": ["clips", "scripting language", "question answering", "topic model", "comprehension"], "abstract": "We introduce the MovieQA dataset which aims to evaluate automatic story comprehension from both video and text. The dataset consists of 14,944 questions about 408 movies with high semantic diversity. The questions range from simpler \"Who\" did \"What\" to \"Whom\", to \"Why\" and \"How\" certain events occurred. Each question comes with a set of five possible answers, a correct one and four deceiving answers provided by human annotators. Our dataset is unique in that it contains multiple sources of information \u2013 video clips, plots, subtitles, scripts, and DVS [32]. We analyze our data through various statistics and methods. We further extend existing QA techniques to show that question-answering with such open-ended semantics is hard. We make this data set public along with an evaluation benchmark to encourage inspiring work in this challenging domain.", "citation": "Citations (115)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "University of Toronto", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Makarand Tapaswi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tapaswi:Makarand", "Yukun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yukun", "Rainer Stiefelhagen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stiefelhagen:Rainer", "Antonio Torralba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torralba_0001:Antonio", "Raquel Urtasun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urtasun:Raquel", "Sanja Fidler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fidler:Sanja"], "pages": 10}
