Though some previous works have shown that K-flats doesn't always provide good performance, little effort has been devoted to analyze its inherent deficiency. In this paper, we address this challenge by showing that the deteriorative performance of K-flats can be attributed to the usual reconstruction error measure and the infinitely extending representations of linear models. Then we propose Localized K-flats algorithm (LKF), which introduces localized representations of linear models and a new distortion measure, to remove confusion among different clusters. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, preliminary experiments show that LKF has the potential to group manifolds with nonlinear structure.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "Nanjing University", "National University of Defense Technology", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Yong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yong", "Yuan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0001:Yuan", "Yi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0003:Yi", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
