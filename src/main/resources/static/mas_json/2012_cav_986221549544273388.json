{"title": "Termination Analysis with Algorithmic Learning.", "fields": ["commit", "true quantified boolean formula", "termination analysis", "mathematical proof", "predicate abstraction"], "abstract": "An algorithmic-learning-based termination analysis technique is presented. The new technique combines transition predicate abstraction, algorithmic learning, and decision procedures to compute transition invariants as proofs of program termination. Compared to the previous approaches that mostly aim to find a particular form of transition invariants, our technique does not commit to any particular one. For the examples that the previous approaches simply give up and report failure our technique can still prove the termination. We compare our technique with others on several benchmarks from literature including PolyRank examples, SNU realtime benchmark, and Windows device driver examples. The result shows that our technique outperforms others both in efficiency and effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Academia Sinica", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Wonchan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wonchan", "Bow-Yaw Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Bow=Yaw", "Kwangkeun Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Kwangkeun"], "pages": 17}
