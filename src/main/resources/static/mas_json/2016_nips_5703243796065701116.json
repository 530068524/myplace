We propose a scalable inference and learning algorithm for FHMMs that draws on ideas from the stochastic variational inference, neural network and copula literatures. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed algorithm requires no message passing procedure among latent variables and can be distributed to a network of computers to speed up learning. Our experiments corroborate that the proposed algorithm does not introduce further approximation bias compared to the proven structured mean-field algorithm, and achieves better performance with long sequences and large FHMMs.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Yin Cheng Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Yin_Cheng", "Pawel M.
