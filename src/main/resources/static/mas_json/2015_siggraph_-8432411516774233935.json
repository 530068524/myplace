{"title": "Shadow shooter: 360-degree all-around virtual 3d interactive content.", "fields": ["shadow", "virtual reality", "projector", "storytelling", "digital humanities"], "abstract": "\"Shadow Shooter\" is a VR shooter game that uses the \"e-Yumi 3D\" bow interface and real physical interactive content that changes a 360-degree all-around view in a room into virtual game space (Figure 1). This system was constructed by developing our previous interactive \"Light Shooter\" content based on \"The Electric Bow Interface\" [Yasumoto and Ohta 2013]. Shadow Shooter expands the virtual game space to all the walls in a room just as in Jones' \"Room Alive\" [Jones et al. 2014]; however, it does not require large-scale equipment such as multiple projectors. It only requires the e-Yumi 3D device that consists of a real bow's components added to Willis's interface with a mobile projector [Willis et al. 2013]. Thus, we constructed a unique device for Shadow Shooter that easily changes the 360-degree all-around view into a virtual game space.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Kanagawa Institute of Technology", "Tokyo University of Technology"], "authors": ["Masasuke Yasumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yasumoto:Masasuke", "Takehiro Teraoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teraoka:Takehiro"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
