{"title": "Student athletes on facebook.", "fields": ["athletes", "anticipation", "student engagement", "impression management", "social network"], "abstract": "Student athletes at U.S. universities are bound by rules affecting their participation in their sport and are highly visible to their fellow students and a larger public of fans. This difference makes them more likely than other students to be sensitive to issues of impression management and use of social network sites (SNSs). In this paper, we show how student athletes at a large university engage with the social network site Facebook compared with their fellow students, including differences in the size of their networks, reported uses of the site, and perceptions about their audience. This work shows that while student athletes have a higher anticipation of being watched, they have similar uses and concerns compared to other students.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University"], "authors": ["Cliff Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Cliff", "Nicole B.
