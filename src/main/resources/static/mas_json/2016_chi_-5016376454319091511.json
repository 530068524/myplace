{"title": "Getting Users' Attention in Web Apps in Likable, Minimally Annoying Ways.", "fields": ["centrality", "graphical user interface elements", "intuition", "user interface design", "annoyance"], "abstract": "Web applications often need to present the user new information in the context of their current activity. Designers rely on a range of UI elements and visual techniques to present the new content to users, such as pop-ups, message icons, and marquees. Web designers need to select which technique to use depending on the centrality of the information and how quickly they need a reaction. However, designers often rely on intuition and anecdotes rather than empirical evidence to drive their decision-making as to which presentation technique to use. This work represents an attempt to quantify these presentation style decisions. We present a large ( n = 1505 ) user study that compares 15 visual attention-grabbing techniques with respect to reaction time, noticeability, annoyance, likability, and recall. We suggest glowing shadows and message icons with badges, as well as more possibilities for future work.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dan Tasse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tasse:Dan", "Anupriya Ankolekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ankolekar:Anupriya", "Joshua M.
