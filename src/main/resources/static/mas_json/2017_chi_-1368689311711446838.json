{"title": "SoPhy: A Wearable Technology for Lower Limb Assessment in Video Consultations of Physiotherapy.", "fields": ["interaction design", "user interface", "videoconferencing", "teleconference", "wearable technology"], "abstract": "Physiotherapists are increasingly using video conferencing tools for their teleconsultations. Yet, the assessment of subtle differences in body movements remains a challenge. To support lower limb assessment in video consultations, we present  SoPhy , a wearable technology consisting of a pair of socks with embedded sensors for patients to wear; and a web interface that displays information about range of weight distribution, foot movement, and foot orientation for physiotherapists in real-time. We conducted a laboratory study of 40 video consultations, in which postgraduate physiotherapy students assessed lower limb function. We compare assessment with and without  SoPhy . Findings show that  SoPhy  increased the confidence in assessing squats exercise and fewer repetitions were required to assess patients when using  SoPhy . We discuss the significance of  SoPhy  to address the challenges of assessing bodily information over video, and present considerations for its integration with clinical practices and tools.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "Queensland University of Technology", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Deepti Aggarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aggarwal:Deepti", "Weiyi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Weiyi", "Thuong N.
