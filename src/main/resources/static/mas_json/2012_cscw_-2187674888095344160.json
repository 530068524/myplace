{"title": "'facebooking' towards crisis recovery and beyond: disruption as an opportunity.", "fields": ["socioeconomics", "social network", "norm", "ethnography", "slippage"], "abstract": "This paper reports on an ethnographic study of Facebook use amongst a population living through ongoing disruption. We interviewed 45 Iraqi citizens, as well as received survey responses from 218 individuals, who have been experiencing the current Gulf War since March 2003. We show how people in a society experiencing conflict use Facebook in ways that are different to uses in non-war societies. We find that Facebook supports people living in crisis environments at two levels. First, Facebook aids people directly to recover from disruption. People used Facebook to create \"safe lists\", to seek help and provide assistance, and to re-construct their social scaffolding. But at a deeper level, citizens also used Facebook to maintain and develop new social norms, and to re-direct their country. We discuss how disruption can serve as an opportunity by which people can re-invent their societies and how our understandings of Facebook should evolve.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Bryan C.
