{"title": "Streaming Variational Bayes.", "fields": ["bayesian probability", "inference", "latent dirichlet allocation", "computation", "bayes theorem"], "abstract": "We present SDA-Bayes, a framework for (S)treaming, (D)istributed, (A)synchronous computation of a Bayesian posterior. The framework makes streaming updates to the estimated posterior according to a user-specified approximation batch primitive. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework, with variational Bayes (VB) as the primitive, by fitting the latent Dirichlet allocation model to two large-scale document collections. We demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm over stochastic variational inference (SVI) by comparing the two after a single pass through a known amount of data\u2014a case where SVI may be applied\u2014and in the streaming setting, where SVI does not apply.", "citation": "Citations (179)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Tamara Broderick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broderick:Tamara", "Nicholas Boyd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boyd:Nicholas", "Andre Wibisono.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wibisono:Andre", "Ashia C.
