Multiple Kernel Learning enables to learn the kernel, from an ensemble of basis kernels, whose combination is optimized in the learning process. Here, we propose Composite Kernel Learning to address the situation where distinct components give rise to a group structure among kernels. Our formulation of the learning problem encompasses several setups, putting more or less emphasis on the group structure. We characterize the convexity of the learning problem, and provide a general wrapper algorithm for computing solutions. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of our method on multi-channel data where groups correspond to channels.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Rouen", "Idiap Research Institute", "University of Rouen", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Beijing University of Chemical Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Beijing University of Chemical Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Guangdong University of Technology", "Guangdong University of Technology", "Southeast University", "Southeast University", "Southeast University", "Universit\u00e9 de T ... e cedex, France", "Beijing Science ...
