{"title": "A Two Level Model for Context Sensitive Inference Rules.", "fields": ["rule of inference", "predicate", "pattern recognition", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Automatic acquisition of inference rules for predicates has been commonly addressed by computing distributional similarity between vectors of argument words, operating at the word space level. A recent line of work, which addresses context sensitivity of rules, represented contexts in a latent topic space and computed similarity over topic vectors. We propose a novel two-level model, which computes similarities between word-level vectors that are biased by topic-level context representations. Evaluations on a naturallydistributed dataset show that our model significantly outperforms prior word-level and topic-level models. We also release a first context-sensitive inference rule set.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Stanford University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Stanford University", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Oren Melamud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melamud:Oren", "Jonathan Berant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berant:Jonathan", "Ido Dagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagan:Ido", "Jacob Goldberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldberger:Jacob", "Idan Szpektor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szpektor:Idan"], "pages": 10}
