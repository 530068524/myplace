{"title": "Wireframe: supporting data-dependent parallelism through dependency graph execution in GPUs.", "fields": ["dataflow", "dependency graph", "data dependency", "cuda", "simd"], "abstract": "GPUs lack fundamental support for data-dependent parallelism and synchronization. While CUDA Dynamic Parallelism signals progress in this direction, many limitations and challenges still remain. This paper introduces  Wireframe , a hardware-software solution that enables generalized support for data-dependent parallelism and synchronization. Wireframe enables applications to naturally express execution dependencies across different thread blocks through a  dependency graph  abstraction at run-time, which is sent to the GPU hardware at kernel launch. At run-time, the hardware enforces the dependencies specified in the dependency graph through a dependency-aware thread block scheduler. Overall, Wireframe is able to improve total execution time up to 65.20% with an average of 45.07%.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "authors": ["AmirAli Abdolrashidi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdolrashidi:AmirAli", "Devashree Tripathy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tripathy:Devashree", "Mehmet Esat Belviranli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belviranli:Mehmet_Esat", "Laxmi Narayan Bhuyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhuyan:Laxmi_Narayan", "Daniel Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong_0001:Daniel"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
