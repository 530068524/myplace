{"title": "Synthesizing Certificates in Networks of Timed Automata.", "fields": ["iterative refinement", "reachability", "automata theory", "certificate", "formal verification"], "abstract": "We present an automatic method for the synthesis of certificates for components in embedded real-time systems. A certificate is a small homomorphic abstraction that can transparently replace the component during model checking: if the verification with the certificate succeeds, then the component is guaranteed to be correct; if the verification with the certificate fails, then the component itself must be erroneous. We give a direct construction, based on a forward and backward reachability analysis of the timed system, and an iterative refinement process, which produces a series of successively smaller certificates. In our experiments, model checking the certificate is several orders of magnitude faster than model checking the original system.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "University of Liverpool"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Bernd Finkbeiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finkbeiner:Bernd", "Hans-J\u00f6rg Peter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peter:Hans=J=ouml=rg", "Sven Schewe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schewe:Sven"], "pages": 12}
