Apart from providing a set of built-in refactorings and code inspection functionalities, Wrangler allows users to define refactorings, code inspections, and general program transformations for themselves to suit their particular needs. These are defined using a template- and rule-based program transformation and analysis framework built into Wrangler.     This paper reports an extension to Wrangler's extension framework, supporting the automatic generation of API migration refactorings from a user-defined adapter module.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Kent", "University of Kent"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Huiqing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Huiqing", "Simon J.
