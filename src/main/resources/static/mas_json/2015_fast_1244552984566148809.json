{"title": "ANViL: Advanced Virtualization for Modern Non-Volatile Memory Devices.", "fields": ["snapshot", "journaling file system", "storage virtualization", "virtualization", "data deduplication"], "abstract": "We present a new form of storage virtualization based on block-level address remapping. By allowing the host system to manipulate this address map with a set of three simple operations (clone, move, and delete), we enable a variety of useful features and optimizations to be readily implemented, including snapshots, deduplication, and single-write journaling. We present a prototype implementation called Project ANViL and demonstrate its utility with a set of case studies.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "SanDisk", "SanDisk", "SanDisk", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Zev Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:Zev", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram", "Swaminathan Sundararaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundararaman:Swaminathan", "Nisha Talagala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talagala:Nisha", "Andrea C.
