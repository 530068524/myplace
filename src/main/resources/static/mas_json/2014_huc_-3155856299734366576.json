{"title": "Privacy behaviors of lifeloggers using wearable cameras.", "fields": ["popularity", "wearable computer", "exit interview", "internet privacy", "lifelog"], "abstract": "A number of wearable 'lifelogging' camera devices have been released recently, allowing consumers to capture images and other sensor data continuously from a first-person perspective. Unlike traditional cameras that are used deliberately and sporadically, lifelogging devices are always 'on' and automatically capturing images. Such features may challenge users' (and bystanders') expectations about privacy and control of image gathering and dissemination. While lifelogging cameras are growing in popularity, little is known about privacy perceptions of these devices or what kinds of privacy challenges they are likely to create.   To explore how people manage privacy in the context of lifelogging cameras, as well as which kinds of first-person images people consider 'sensitive,' we conducted an  in situ  user study ( N  = 36) in which participants wore a lifelogging device for a week, answered questionnaires about the collected images, and participated in an exit interview. Our findings indicate that: 1) some people may prefer to manage privacy through  in situ  physical control of image collection in order to avoid later burdensome review of all collected images; 2) a combination of factors including time, location, and the objects and people appearing in the photo determines its 'sensitivity;' and 3) people are concerned about the privacy of bystanders, despite reporting almost no opposition or concerns expressed by bystanders over the course of the study.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Naval Surface Warfare Center", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Dartmouth College", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Roberto Hoyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoyle:Roberto", "Robert Templeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Templeman:Robert", "Steven Armes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Armes:Steven", "Denise Anthony.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anthony:Denise", "David J.
