{"title": "Changes in use and perception of facebook.", "fields": ["user experience design", "user profile", "social computing", "survey data collection", "cyberpsychology"], "abstract": "As social computing systems persist over time, the user experiences and interactions they support may change. One type of social computing system, Social Network Sites (SNSs), are becoming more popular across broad segments of Internet users. Facebook, in particular, has very broad participation amongst college attendees, and has been growing in other populations as well. This paper looks at how use of Facebook has changed over time, as indicated by three consecutive years of survey data and interviews with a subset of survey respondents. Reported uses of the site remain relatively constant over time, but the perceived audience for user profiles and attitudes about the site show differences over the study period.", "citation": "Citations (589)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University"], "authors": ["Cliff Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Cliff", "Nicole B.
