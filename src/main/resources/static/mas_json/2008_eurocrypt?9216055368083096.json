This protocol HB +  is proven secure against active attacks, though preserving HB's advantages: mainly, requiring so few resources to run that it can be implemented on an RFID tag. However, in a wider adversarial model, Gilbert, Robshaw and Sibert exhibit a very effective attack against H + . We here show how a modification of the HB  +  protocol thwarts Gilbert et al's attack. The resulting protocol, HB ++ , remains a good choice for RFID authentication", "citation": "Citations (387)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["SAGEM", "SAGEM", "SAGEM", "University of Oviedo", "University of Oviedo", "University of Oviedo", "University of Oviedo", "University of Oviedo", "Orange S.A.", "Orange S.A.", "Orange S.A.", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "University of Oviedo", "University of Oviedo", "University of Oviedo", "University of Oviedo", "University of Oviedo", "Zhejiang University of Science and Technology", "Zhejiang University", "North Dakota State University", "Maxim Integrated"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Henri Gilbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilbert:Henri", "Matthew J.
