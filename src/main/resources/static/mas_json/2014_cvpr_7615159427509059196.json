This is an extremely difficult problem as no pixel-wise labelings are available, not even at training time. In this paper, we show that this problem can be formalized as an instance of learning in a latent structured prediction framework, where the graphical model encodes the presence and absence of a class as well as the assignments of semantic labels to superpixels. As a consequence, we are able to leverage standard algorithms with good theoretical properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using the challenging SIFT-flow dataset and show average per-class accuracy improvements of 7% over the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jia Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jia", "Alexander G.
