{"title": "TransDec: A spatiotemporal query processing framework for transportation systems.", "fields": ["immersion", "temporal database", "point of interest", "flow network", "visualization"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present TransDec, an end-to-end-data-driven system which enables spatiotemporal queries in transportation systems with dynamic, real-time and historical data. TransDec fuses a variety of real-world spatiotemporal datasets including massive traffic sensor data, trajectory data, transportation network data, and point-of-interest data to create an immersive and realistic virtual model of a transportation system. With TransDec, we address the challenges in visualization, monitoring, querying and analysis of dynamic and large-scale transportation data in both time and space.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Ugur Demiryurek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demiryurek:Ugur", "Farnoush Banaei Kashani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kashani:Farnoush_Banaei", "Cyrus Shahabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahabi:Cyrus"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
