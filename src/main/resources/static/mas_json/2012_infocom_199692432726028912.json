Rate allocation is a key problem in wireless network design, but a very challenging problem because: (i) wireless interference is global, i.e., a transmission interferes all other simultaneous transmissions, and (ii) the rate-power relation is non-convex and non-continuous, where the discontinuity is due to limited number of coding-modulation choices in practical systems. In this paper, we consider a realistic Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio (SINR) based interference model, and assume continuous power space and finite rate options (coding-modulation choices). We propose a distributed power control and coding-modulation adaptation algorithm using annealed Gibbs sampling, which achieves throughput optimality in an arbitrary network topology.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Qualcomm", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Shan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Shan", "Xinzhou Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xinzhou", "Lei Ying.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ying:Lei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
