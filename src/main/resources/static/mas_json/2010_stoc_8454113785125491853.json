Unweighted matroid matching for linear matroids was solved by Lovasz, and the problem is known to be intractable for general matroids. We present a PTAS for unweighted matroid matching for general matroids. In contrast, we show that natural LP relaxations have an \u03a9(n) integrality gap and moreover, \u03a9(n) rounds of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy are necessary to bring the gap down to a constant. More generally, for any fixed k>=2 and e>0, we obtain a (k/2+e)-approximation for matroid matching in k-uniform hypergraphs, also known as the matroid k-parity problem. As a consequence, we obtain a (k/2+e)-approximation for the problem of finding the maximum-cardinality set in the intersection of k matroids. We have also designed a 3/2-approximation for the weighted version of a special case of matroid matching, the matchoid problem.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "University of Warwick", "IBM", "Industrial and  ... ons Engineering"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Jon", "Maxim Sviridenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sviridenko:Maxim", "Jan Vondr\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vondr=aacute=k:Jan"], "pages": 10}
