Informally speaking, a digital watermarking scheme for cryptographic functions embeds information, called a mark, into functions such as (trapdoor) one-way functions and decryption functions of public-key encryption. It is required that a mark-embedded function is functionally equivalent to the original function and it is difficult for adversaries to remove the embedded mark without damaging the function. In spite of its importance and usefulness, there have only been a few theoretical studies on watermarking for functions (or program), and we do not have rigorous and meaningful definitions of watermarking for cryptographic functions and concrete constructions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["NTT Secure Plat ... rm Laboratories"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ryo Nishimaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishimaki:Ryo"], "pages": 15}
