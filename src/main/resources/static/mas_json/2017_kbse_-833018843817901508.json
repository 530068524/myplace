This way, social networks like Twitter or Telegram are used for leisure, and they frequently serve as a discussion media for work-related activities. In this paper, we propose taking advantage of social networks to enable the collaborative creation of models by groups of users. The process is assisted by modelling bots that orchestrate the collaboration and interpret the users' inputs (in natural language) to incrementally build a (meta-)model. The advantages of this modelling approach include ubiquity of use, automation, assistance, natural user interaction, traceability of design decisions, possibility to incorporate coordination protocols, and seamless integration with the user's normal daily usage of social networks. We present a prototype implementation called SOCIO, able to work over several social networks like Twitter and Telegram, and a preliminary evaluation showing promising results.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Madrid", "Autonomous University of Madrid", "Autonomous University of Madrid", "Autonomous University of Madrid"], "authors": ["Sara P\u00e9rez-Soler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=eacute=rez=Soler:Sara", "Esther Guerra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerra:Esther", "Juan de Lara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lara:Juan_de", "Francisco Jurado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurado_0001:Francisco"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
