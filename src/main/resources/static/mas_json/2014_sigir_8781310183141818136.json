We model sequences of interactions with search result and content pages during information search sessions. Two representations are created: the sequences of page use and a cognitive representation of page interactions. The cognitive representation is based on logged eye movement patterns of textual information acquisition via the reading process. Page sequence actions from task sessions (n=109) in a user study are analyzed. The study tasks differed from one another in basic dimensions of complexity, specificity,level, and the type of information product (intellectual or factual). The results show that differences in task types can be measured at both the level of observations of page type sequences and at the level of cognitive activity on the pages. We discuss the implications for personalization of search systems, measurement of task similarity and the development of user-centered information systems that can support the user's current and expected search intentions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Michael J.
