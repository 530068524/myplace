A key source of difficulty is the tyrannical nature of existing approaches to realizing languages -- adding a new language construct means that any tool, document or programmer that works with the language must be prepared to deal with that construct.   A registration-based approach makes it possible to define language constructs that are not tyrannical. They are instead transient -- the program appears to be written using the constructs only so long as a given programmer wants to see it that way. This approach may have the potential to greatly facilitate programming language innovation.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Samuel Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Samuel", "Gregor Kiczales.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiczales:Gregor"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2010", "pages": 20}
