Our approach is based on the maximum likelihood estimator and its convex relaxation, and generalizes recent works in graph clustering to the biclustering setting. In addition to standard biclustering setting where one seeks to discover clustering structure simultaneously in two domain sets, we show that the same algorithm can be as effective when clustering structure only occurs in one domain. This allows for an alternative approach to clustering that is more natural in some scenarios. We present theoretical results that provide sufficient conditions for the recovery of the true underlying clusters under a generalized stochastic block model. These are further validated by our empirical results on both synthetic and real data.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "University of California, Berkeley", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Shiau Hong Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Shiau_Hong", "Yudong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yudong", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan"], "pages": 10}
