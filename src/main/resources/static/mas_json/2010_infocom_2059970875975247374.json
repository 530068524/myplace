Given their potentially devastating impact, we characterize the spread of correlated failures in this paper, which lays the foundation for evaluating and improving the failure resilience of existing wireless networks. We model the failure contagiousness as two generic functions: the failure impact radius distribution function $f_r(x)$ and the failure connection function $g(x)$. By using the percolation theory, we determine the respective characteristic regimes of $f_r(x)$ and $g(x)$ in which correlated failures will and will not percolate in the network. As our model represents various failure scenarios, the results are generally applicable in understanding the spread of a wide range of correlated failures.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Yi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yi", "Wenye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenye"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
