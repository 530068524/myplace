To the best knowledge of the authors, there is no previous work that successfully recognises spontaneous facial micro-expressions. In this paper we show how a temporal interpolation model together with the first comprehensive spontaneous micro-expression corpus enable us to accurately recognise these very short expressions. We designed an induced emotion suppression experiment to collect the new corpus using a high-speed camera. The system is the first to recognise spontaneous facial micro-expressions and achieves very promising results that compare favourably with the human micro-expression detection accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (171)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Tomas Pfister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfister:Tomas", "Xiaobai Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiaobai", "Guoying Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Guoying", "Matti Pietik\u00e4inen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietik=auml=inen:Matti"], "pages": 8}
