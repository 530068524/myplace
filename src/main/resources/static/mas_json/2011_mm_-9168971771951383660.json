In this research, a method has been developed to meet such requirements using the idea of gist and mosaic art so that viewers could understand the meaning of a whole scene without paying much attention in individual details. First, given a photo album, all chronologically ordered images are normalized to a smaller size, and then mosaicked side-by-side to create a signature image representing for that album. Next, by integrating the optimized linear programming with the color descriptor of the signature image, not only the event-type of the album but also all sub-event-types of the sub-sequence photos are decided. More than 19,000 images of five varied event-types have been used to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method could detect events towards annotation and re-organization of personal photo albums with high accuracy at a rapid speed.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento"], "authors": ["Minh-Son Dao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dao:Minh=Son", "Duc-Tien Dang-Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dang=Nguyen:Duc=Tien", "Francesco G.
