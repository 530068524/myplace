{"title": "Integrating local classifiers through nonlinear dynamics on label graphs with an application to image segmentation.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "contextual image classification", "dynamical system", "pairwise comparison", "piecewise"], "abstract": "We present a new method to combine possibly inconsistent locally (piecewise) trained conditional models p(y \u03b1 \u2223x \u03b1 ) into pseudo-samples from a global model. Our method does not require training of a CRF, but instead generates samples by iterating forward a weakly chaotic dynamical system. The new method is illustrated on image segmentation tasks where classifiers based on local appearance cues are combined with pairwise boundary cues.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yutian Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yutian", "Andrew Gelfand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelfand:Andrew", "Charless C.
