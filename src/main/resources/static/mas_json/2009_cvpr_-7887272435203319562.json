{"title": "Visual tracking via geometric particle filtering on the affine group with optimal importance functions.", "fields": ["affine coordinate system", "affine group", "affine shape adaptation", "affine combination", "affine transformation"], "abstract": "We propose a geometric method for visual tracking, in which the 2-D affine motion of a given object template is estimated in a video sequence by means of coordinate-invariant particle filtering on the 2-D affine group Aff(2). Tracking performance is further enhanced through a geometrically defined optimal importance function, obtained explicitly via Taylor expansion of a principal component analysis based measurement function on Aff(2). The efficiency of our approach to tracking is demonstrated via comparative experiments.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Junghyun Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Junghyun", "Kyoung Mu Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyoung_Mu", "Frank Chongwoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Frank_Chongwoo"], "pages": 8}
