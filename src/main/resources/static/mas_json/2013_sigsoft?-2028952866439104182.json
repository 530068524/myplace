We investigate the feasibility of summarizing code examples for better presenting a code example. Our algorithm based on machine learning could approximate summaries in an oracle manually generated by humans with a precision of 0.71. This result is promising as summaries with this level of precision achieved the same level of agreement as human annotators with each other.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Annie T.
