It is often of significant importance to figure out who initially diffuses the information, i.e., finding a rumor source or a trend setter. It is known that such a task is highly challenging and the source detection probability cannot be beyond 31% for regular trees, if we just estimate the source from a given diffusion snapshot. In practice, finding the source often entails the process of querying that asks \u201cAre you the rumor source?\u201d or \u201cWho tells you the rumor?\u201d that would increase the chance of detecting the source. In this paper, we consider two kinds of querying: (a) simple batch querying and (b) interactive querying with direction under the assumption that queriees can be untruthful with some probability. We propose estimation algorithms for those queries, and quantify their detection performance and the amount of extra budget due to untruthfulness, analytically showing that querying significantly improves the detection performance. We perform extensive simulations to validate our theoretical findings over synthetic and real-world social network topologies.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Jaeyoung Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jaeyoung", "Sangwoo Moon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moon:Sangwoo", "Jiin Woo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woo:Jiin", "Kyunghwan Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Kyunghwan", "Jinwoo Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Jinwoo", "Yung Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Yung"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
