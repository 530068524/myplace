{"title": "Computational sprinting on a hardware/software testbed.", "fields": ["context switch", "idle", "passive cooling", "sprint", "dark silicon"], "abstract": "CMOS scaling trends have led to an inflection point where thermal constraints (especially in mobile devices that employ only passive cooling) preclude sustained operation of all transistors on a chip --- a phenomenon called \"dark silicon.\" Recent research proposed computational sprinting --- exceeding sustainable thermal limits for short intervals --- to improve responsiveness in light of the bursty computation demands of many media-rich interactive mobile applications. Computational sprinting improves responsiveness by activating reserve cores (parallel sprinting) and/or boosting frequency/voltage (frequency sprinting) to power levels that far exceed the system's sustainable cooling capabilities, relying on thermal capacitance to buffer heat.   Prior work analyzed the feasibility of sprinting through modeling and simulation. In this work, we investigate sprinting using a hardware/software testbed. First, we study unabridged sprints, wherein the computation completes before temperature becomes critical, demonstrating a 6.3x responsiveness gain, and a 6% energy efficiency improvement by racing to idle. We then analyze truncated sprints, wherein our software runtime system must intervene to prevent overheating by throttling parallelism and frequency before the computation is complete. To avoid oversubscription penalties (context switching inefficiencies after a truncated parallel sprint), we develop a sprint-aware task-based parallel runtime. We find that maximal-intensity sprinting is not always best, introduce the concept of sprint pacing, and evaluate an adaptive policy for selecting sprint intensity. We report initial results using a phase change heat sink to extend maximum sprint duration. Finally, we demonstrate that a sprint-and-rest operating regime can actually outperform thermally-limited sustained execution.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Arun Raghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavan:Arun", "Laurel Emurian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emurian:Laurel", "Lei Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Lei", "Marios C.
