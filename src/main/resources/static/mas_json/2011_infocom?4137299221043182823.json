People with handheld devices can easily interact with the network and collect data. We propose a novel approach for mobile users to collect the network-wide data. The routing structure of data collection is additively updated with the movement of the mobile user. With this approach, we only perform a local modification to update the routing structure while the routing performance is bounded and controlled compared to the optimal performance. The proposed protocol is easy to implement. Our analysis shows that the proposed approach is scalable in maintenance overheads, performs efficiently in the routing performance, and provides continuous data delivery during the user movement. We implement the proposed protocol in a prototype system and test its feasibility and applicability by a 49-node testbed. We further conduct extensive simulations to examine the efficiency and scalability of our protocol with varied network settings.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Nanyang Technological University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Zhenjiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhenjiang", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo", "Jiliang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jiliang", "Zhichao Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Zhichao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
