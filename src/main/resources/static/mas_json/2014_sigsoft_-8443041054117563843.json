{"title": "Speculative reprogramming.", "fields": ["software development", "systems engineering", "reprogramming", "development environment", "computer science"], "abstract": "Although software development involves making numerous decisions amongst alternatives, the design and implementation choices made typically become invisible; what a developer sees in the project's artifacts are the end result of all of the decisions. What if, instead, all of the choices made were tracked and it was easy for a developer to revisit a point where a decision was made and choose another alternative? What if the development environment could detect and suggest alternative choices? What if it was easy and low-cost to try another path? We explore the idea of speculative reprogramming that could support a what-if environment for the programming stages of software development.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "North Carolina State University", "University of Bordeaux"], "authors": ["Marc Palyart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palyart:Marc", "Gail C.
