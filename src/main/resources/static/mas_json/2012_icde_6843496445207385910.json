Our formulation is based on a two-level scheme. In the first level, we use a RP-tree that divides the dataset into sub-groups with bounded aspect ratios and is used to distinguish well-separated clusters. During the second level, we compute a single LSH hash table for each sub-group along with a hierarchical structure based on space-filling curves. Given a query, we first determine the sub-group that it belongs to and perform $k$-nearest neighbor search within the suitable buckets in the LSH hash table corresponding to the sub-group. Our algorithm also maps well to current GPU architectures and can improve the quality of approximate KNN queries as compared to prior LSH-based algorithms. We highlight its performance on two large, high-dimensional image datasets. Given a runtime budget, Bi-level LSH can provide better accuracy in terms of recall or error ration. Moreover, our formulation reduces the variation in runtime cost or the quality of results.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Jia Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Jia", "Dinesh Manocha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manocha:Dinesh"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
