{"title": "Emotional and behavioral responses to haptic stimulation.", "fields": ["stimulus", "subliminal stimuli", "arousal", "haptic technology", "stimulation"], "abstract": "A prototype of friction-based horizontally rotating fingertip stimulator was used to investigate emotional experiences and behavioral responses to haptic stimulation. The rotation style of 12 different stimuli was varied by burst length (i.e., 20, 50, 100 ms), continuity (i.e., continuous and discontinuous), and direction (e.g., forward and backward). Using these stimuli 528 stimulus pairs were presented to 12 subjects who were to distinguish if stimuli in each pair were the same or different. Then they rated the stimuli using four scales measuring the pleasantness, arousal, approachability, and dominance qualities of the 12 stimuli. The results showed that continuous forward-backward rotating stimuli were rated as significantly more unpleasant, arousing, avoidable, and dominating than other types of stimulations (e.g., discontinuous forward rotation). The reaction times to these stimuli were significantly faster than reaction times to discontinuous forward and backward rotating stimuli. The results clearly suggest that even simple haptic stimulation can carry emotional information. The results can be utilized when making use of haptics in human-technology interaction.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Katri Salminen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salminen:Katri", "Veikko Surakka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Surakka:Veikko", "Jani Lylykangas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lylykangas:Jani", "Jukka Raisamo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raisamo:Jukka", "Rami Saarinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saarinen:Rami", "Roope Raisamo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raisamo:Roope", "Jussi Rantala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rantala:Jussi", "Grigori E.
