This tutorial aims to introduce the key technical underpinnings of these deployed systems, to survey current research that addresses related problems within the LDP model, and to identify relevant open problems and research directions for the community.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Warwick", "Purdue University", "AT&T Labs"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Graham Cormode.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cormode:Graham", "Somesh Jha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jha:Somesh", "Tejas Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni:Tejas", "Ninghui Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ninghui", "Divesh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Divesh", "Tianhao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Tianhao"], "pages": 4}
