{"title": "Assumption-Based Argumentation Dialogues.", "fields": ["argumentation theory", "artificial intelligence", "persuasion", "semantics", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We propose a formal model for argumentation-based dialogues between agents, using assumption-based argumentation (ABA). The model is given in terms of ABA-specific utterances, trees drawn from dialogues and legal-move and outcome functions. We prove a formal connection between these dialogues and argumentation semantics. We illustrate persuasion as an application of the dialogue model.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xiuyi Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Xiuyi", "Francesca Toni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toni:Francesca"], "pages": 6}
