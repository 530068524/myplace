We first introduce MoK-SimRank to significantly improve the speed of SimRank, one of the most popular algorithms for computing node similarity in information networks. Next, we propose an algorithm called SimLearn to (1) extend MoK-SimRank to heterogeneous image-rich information network, and (2) account for both link-based and content-based similarities by seamlessly integrating reinforcement learning with feature learning.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Eastman Kodak Company", "Eastman Kodak Company", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Eastman Kodak Company"], "authors": ["Xin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin_0001:Xin", "Jiebo Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jiebo", "Jie Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Jie", "Gang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Gang", "Dhiraj Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi:Dhiraj", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
