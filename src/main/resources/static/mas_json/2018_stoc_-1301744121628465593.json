{"title": "A generalized Tur\u00e1n problem and its applications.", "fields": ["graph property", "hierarchy", "graph", "discrete mathematics", "vertex", "mathematical analysis", "combinatorics", "mathematics", "integer"], "abstract": "Our first theorem in this paper is a hierarchy theorem for the query complexity of testing graph properties with 1-sided error; more precisely, we show that for every sufficiently fast-growing function  f , there is a graph property whose 1-sided-error query complexity is precisely  f (\u0398(1/e)). No result of this type was previously known for  any   f  which is super-polynomial. Goldreich [ECCC 2005] asked to exhibit a graph property whose query complexity is 2 \u0398(1/e) . Our hierarchy theorem partially resolves this problem by exhibiting a property whose 1-sided-error query complexity is 2 \u0398(1/e) . We also use our hierarchy theorem in order to resolve a problem raised by the second author and Alon [STOC 2005] regarding testing relaxed versions of bipartiteness.    Our second theorem states that for any function  f  there is a graph property whose 1-sided-error query complexity is  f (\u0398(1/e)) while its 2-sided-error query complexity is only poly(1/e). This is the first indication of the surprising power that 2-sided-error testing algorithms have over 1-sided-error ones, even when restricted to properties that are testable with 1-sided error. Again, no result of this type was previously known for any  f  that is super polynomial.    The above theorems are derived from a graph theoretic result which we think is of independent interest, and might have further applications. Alon and Shikhelman [JCTB 2016] introduced the following generalized Turan problem: for fixed graphs  H  and  T , and an integer  n , what is the maximum number of copies of  T , denoted by ex( n , T , H ), that can appear in an  n -vertex  H -free graph? This problem received a lot of attention recently, with an emphasis on ex( n , C  3 , C  2l +1 ). Our third theorem in this paper gives tight bounds for ex( n , C   k  , C  l ) for  all  the remaining values of  k  and l.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Lior Gishboliner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gishboliner:Lior", "Asaf Shapira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shapira:Asaf"], "pages": 13}
