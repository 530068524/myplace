A total of 753 patients infected with HIV who were antiretroviral\nnaive were screened and 602 patients entered the study.InterventionPatients were randomized to receive either tenofovir DF (n = 299) or\nstavudine (n = 303), with placebo, in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz.Main Outcome MeasureProportion of patients with HIV RNA levels of less than 400 copies/mL\nat week 48.ResultsIn the primary intent-to-treat analysis in which patients with missing\ndata or who added or switched antiretroviral medications before week 48 were\nconsidered as failures, the proportion of patients with HIV RNA of less than\n400 copies/mL at week 48 was 239 (80%) of 299 in patients receiving tenofovir\nDF and 253 (84%) of 301 in patients receiving stavudine (95% confidence interval,\n\u221210.4% to 1.5%), exceeding the predefined \u221210% limit for equivalence.\nHowever, equivalence was demonstrated in the secondary analyses (HIV RNA <50\ncopies/mL) at week 48 and through 144 weeks. Virologic failure was associated\nmost frequently with efavirenz and lamivudine resistance. Through 144 weeks,\nthe K65R mutation emerged in 8 and 2 patients in the tenofovir DF and stavudine\ngroups, respectively (P = .06). A more favorable\nmean change from baseline in fasting lipid profile was noted in the tenofovir\nDF group at week 144: for triglyceride levels (+1 mg/dL for tenofovir DF [n\n= 170] vs +134 mg/dL for stavudine [n = 162], P<.001),\ntotal cholesterol (+30 mg/dL [n = 170] vs +58 mg/dL [n = 162], P<.001), direct low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+14 mg/dL [n\n= 169] vs +26 mg/dL [n = 161], P<.001), and high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (+9 mg/dL [n = 168] vs +6 mg/dL [n = 154], P = .003). Investigator-reported lipodystrophy was less common in the\ntenofovir DF group compared with the stavudine group (9 [3%] of 299 vs 58\n[19%] of 301, P<.001). The number of bone fractures\nand the renal safety profile were similar between the 2 groups.ConclusionsThrough 144 weeks, the combination of tenofovir DF, lamivudine, and\nefavirenz was highly effective and comparable with stavudine, lamivudine,\nand efavirenz in antiretroviral-naive patients. However, tenofovir DF appeared\nto be associated with better lipid profiles and less lipodystrophy.", "citation": "Citations (1,905)", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Autonomous University of Madrid", "Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "University of Washington", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Harvard University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Yonsei University", "Orlando Immunology Center", "Chelsea and Wes ... inster Hospital", "Chelsea and Wes ... inster Hospital", "Dept. of Electr ... ul, South Korea", "Dept. of Electr ... ul, South Korea", "Dept. of Electr ... ul, South Korea", "Dept. of Electr ... ul, South Korea", "Gilead Sciences", "Agency for Defe ... on, South Korea"], "authors": ["Yabei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yabei", "Junge Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Junge", "Yanhua Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Yanhua", "Kaiqi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Kaiqi", "Tieniu Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Tieniu"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
