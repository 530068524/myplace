{"title": "Multi-Tactic Distance-Based Outlier Detection.", "fields": ["analytics", "workload", "anomaly detection", "distributed database", "outlier"], "abstract": "As datasets increase radically in size, highly scalable algorithms leveraging modern distributed infrastructures need to be developed for detecting outliers in massive datasets. In this work, we present the first distributed distance-based outlier detection approach using the MapReduce-based infrastructure, called DOD. DOD features a single-pass execution framework that minimizes communication overhead. Furthermore, DOD overturns two fundamental assumptions widely adopted in the distributed analytics literature, namely cardinality-based load balancing and one algorithm for all data. The multi-tactic strategy of DOD achieves a truly balanced workload by taking into account the data characteristics in data partitioning and assigns most appropriate algorithm for each partition based on our theoretical cost models established for distinct classes of detection algorithms. Thus, DOD effectively minimizes the end-to-end execution time. Our experimental study confirms the efficiency of DOD and its scalability to terabytes of data, beating the baseline solutions by a factor of 20x.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"], "authors": ["Lei Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Lei", "Yizhou Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Yizhou", "Caitlin Kuhlman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhlman:Caitlin", "Qingyang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qingyang", "Elke A.
