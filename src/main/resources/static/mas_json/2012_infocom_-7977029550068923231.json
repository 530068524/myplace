In particular, we introduce a new control parameter, termed cancellation coefficient, to characterize the performance of full duplex relay transmission mode. For both amplitude-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relay networks, we develop the dynamic hybrid resource allocation policies under full duplex and half duplex transmission modes to maximize the network throughput for the given delay QoS constraint measured by the QoS exponent. The numerical results obtained verify that our proposed resource allocation schemes can support diverse QoS requirements over wireless relay networks under full duplex and half duplex transmission modes. Our analysis indicates that the optimal effective capacity of perfect full duplex transmission mode is not the just twice as much as the optimal effective capacity of half duplex transmission mode. Our numerical analyses also show that the hybrid transmission mode can achieve better performance than just using full duplex or half duplex transmission mode alone.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Xidian University"], "authors": ["Wenchi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wenchi", "Xi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Xi", "Hailin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Hailin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
