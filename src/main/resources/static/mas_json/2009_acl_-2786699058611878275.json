{"title": "A non-contiguous Tree Sequence Alignment-based Model for Statistical Machine Translation.", "fields": ["interval tree", "machine translation", "contiguity", "nist", "multiple sequence alignment"], "abstract": "The tree sequence based translation model allows the violation of syntactic boundaries in a rule to capture non-syntactic phrases, where a tree sequence is a contiguous sequence of subtrees. This paper goes further to present a translation model based on non-contiguous tree sequence alignment, where a non-contiguous tree sequence is a sequence of sub-trees and gaps. Compared with the contiguous tree sequence-based model, the proposed model can well handle non-contiguous phrases with any large gaps by means of non-contiguous tree sequence alignment. An algorithm targeting the noncontiguous constituent decoding is also proposed. Experimental results on the NIST MT-05 Chinese-English translation task show that the proposed model statistically significantly outperforms the baseline systems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jun", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Min", "Chew Lim Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chew_Lim"], "pages": 9}
