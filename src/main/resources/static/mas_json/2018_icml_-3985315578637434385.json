{"title": "Tighter Variational Bounds are Not Necessarily Better.", "fields": ["empirical evidence", "generative grammar", "special case", "inference", "estimator"], "abstract": "We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that using tighter evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) can be detrimental to the process of learning an inference network by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio of the gradient estimator. Our results call into question common implicit assumptions that tighter ELBOs are better variational objectives for simultaneous model learning and inference amortization schemes. Based on our insights, we introduce three new algorithms: the partially importance weighted auto-encoder (PIWAE), the multiply importance weighted auto-encoder (MIWAE), and the combination importance weighted auto-encoder (CIWAE), each of which includes the standard importance weighted auto-encoder (IWAE) as a special case. We show that each can deliver improvements over IWAE, even when performance is measured by the IWAE target itself. Moreover, PIWAE can simultaneously deliver improvements in both the quality of the inference network and generative network, relative to IWAE.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Tom Rainforth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rainforth:Tom", "Adam R.
