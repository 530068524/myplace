Early researchers have presented the mutual reinforcement principle (MR) between sentence and term for simultaneous key phrase and salient sentence extraction in generic single-document summarization. In this work, we extend the MR to the mutual reinforcement chain (MRC) of three different text granularities, i.e., document, sentence and terms. The aim is to provide a general reinforcement framework and a formal mathematical modeling for the MRC. Going one step further, we incorporate the query influence into the MRC to cope with the need for query-oriented multi-document summarization. While the previous summarization approaches often calculate the similarity regardless of the query, we develop a query-sensitive similarity to measure the affinity between the pair of texts. When evaluated on the DUC 2005 dataset, the experimental results suggest that the proposed query-sensitive MRC (Qs-MRC) is a promising approach for summarization.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Wuhan University"], "authors": ["Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu", "Wenjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenjie", "Qin Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Qin", "Yanxiang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yanxiang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
