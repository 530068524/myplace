{"title": "LearnPADS: automatic tool generation from ad hoc data.", "fields": ["tree traversal", "user experience design", "xquery", "parsing", "grammar induction"], "abstract": "In this demonstration, we will present LEARNPADS, a fully automatic system for generating ad hoc data processing tools. When presented with a collection of ad hoc data, the system (1) analyzes the data, (2) infers a PADS [4, 5] description, (3) generates parser, printer, validation and traversal libraries and (4) links these libraries with format-independent tool suites to form stand-alone applications. These applications provide statistical analysis, XML conversion, CSV conversion, the ability to query with the Galax XQuery engine [3], and the ability to graph selected data elements, all directly from ASCII ad hoc data without human intervention. SIGMOD attendees will see both the user experience with LEARNPADS and the internals of the multi-phase inference algorithm which lies at the heart of the system.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["AT&T Labs", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kathleen Fisher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fisher:Kathleen", "David Walker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walker:David", "Kenny Qili Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Kenny_Qili"], "pages": 4}
