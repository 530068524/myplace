We experiment with time-series data from bedside monitoring devices from the available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database (MIMIC). Our results show that not only encoder-decoder LSTM approach works well for detecting the difference between anomalous and normal missing observations in streaming medical data, but also has an imputation potential for the missing data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Oak Ridge National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Michael Bowie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowie:Michael", "Edmon Begoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Begoli:Edmon", "Byung Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Byung"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
