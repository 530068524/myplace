{"title": "Web searching for daily living.", "fields": ["same origin policy", "web query classification", "data web", "static web page", "site map"], "abstract": "The new concept proposed in this paper is a query free web search that automatically retrieves a web page including information related to the daily activity that we are currently engaged in for automatically displaying the page on Internet-connected domestic appliances around us such as televisions. When we are washing a coffee maker, for example, a web page is retrieved that includes tips such as `cleaning a coffee maker with vinegar removes stains well.' A method designed on the basis of this concept automatically searches for a web page by using a query constructed from the use of ordinary household objects that is detected by sensors attached to the objects. An in-situ experiment tests a variety of IR techniques and the experiment confirmed that our daily activities can produce related web pages with high accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone"], "authors": ["Takuya Maekawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maekawa:Takuya", "Yutaka Yanagisawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yanagisawa:Yutaka", "Yasushi Sakurai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakurai:Yasushi", "Yasue Kishino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kishino:Yasue", "Koji Kamei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamei:Koji", "Takeshi Okadome.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okadome:Takeshi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
