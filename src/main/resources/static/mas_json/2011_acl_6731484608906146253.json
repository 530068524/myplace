In this paper, we study how to build a Korean comparison mining system. Our work is composed of two consecutive tasks: 1) classifying comparative sentences into different types and 2) mining comparative entities and predicates. We perform various experiments to find relevant features and learning techniques. As a result, we achieve outstanding performance enough for practical use.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Dong-a University", "Dong-a University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Seon Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Seon", "Youngjoong Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko:Youngjoong"], "pages": 9}
