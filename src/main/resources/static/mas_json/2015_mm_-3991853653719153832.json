{"title": "Intuitive Input Methods for Interactive Segmentation on Mobile Touch-Based Devices.", "fields": ["multimedia", "segmentation", "theoretical computer science", "mobile device", "image segmentation"], "abstract": "Existing interactive image segmentation approaches mainly focus on the algorithms rather than the input methods. The literature regarding the input methods is mainly applied to desktop PCs. However, there is a transition to mobile touch-based devices. In this paper we describe our approach to identify a set of intuitive input methods for interactive segmentation on mobile devices. Preliminary results of two user studies are presented. A description of our planned research is given, divided into initial and refinement input methods and the exploitation of the input for segmentation algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["OFFIS"], "authors": ["Christoph Korinke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korinke:Christoph"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
