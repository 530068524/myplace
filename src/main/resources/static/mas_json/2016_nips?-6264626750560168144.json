The proposed methodology leverages kernel-based multi-task learning to curb the embarrassing phenomenon of quantile crossing, with a one-step estimation procedure and no post-processing. Moreover, this framework comes along with theoretical guarantees and an efficient coordinate descent learning algorithm. Numerical experiments on benchmark and real datasets highlight the enhancements of our approach regarding the prediction error, the crossing occurrences and the training time.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Maxime Sangnier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sangnier:Maxime", "Olivier Fercoq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fercoq:Olivier", "Florence d'Alch\u00e9-Buc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/d=Alch=eacute==Buc:Florence"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
