We thus propose a novel database of 65 cooking activities, continuously recorded in a realistic setting. Activities are distinguished by fine-grained body motions that have low inter-class variability and high intra-class variability due to diverse subjects and ingredients. We benchmark two approaches on our dataset, one based on articulated pose tracks and the second using holistic video features. While the holistic approach outperforms the pose-based approach, our evaluation suggests that fine-grained activities are more difficult to detect and the body model can help in those cases. Providing high-resolution videos as well as an intermediate pose representation we hope to foster research in fine-grained activity recognition.", "citation": "Citations (290)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Marcus Rohrbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rohrbach:Marcus", "Sikandar Amin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amin:Sikandar", "Mykhaylo Andriluka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andriluka:Mykhaylo", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 8}
