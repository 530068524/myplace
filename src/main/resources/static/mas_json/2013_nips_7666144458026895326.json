{"title": "Graphical Models for Inference with Missing Data.", "fields": ["graph", "existential quantification", "inference", "consistent estimator", "graphical model"], "abstract": "We address the problem of recoverability i.e. deciding whether there exists a consistent estimator of a given relation Q, when data are missing not at random. We employ a formal representation called 'Missingness Graphs' to explicitly portray the causal mechanisms responsible for missingness and to encode dependencies between these mechanisms and the variables being measured. Using this representation, we derive conditions that the graph should satisfy to ensure recoverability and devise algorithms to detect the presence of these conditions in the graph.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Karthika Mohan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohan:Karthika", "Judea Pearl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pearl:Judea", "Jin Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Jin"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
