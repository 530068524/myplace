However, many outdoor user-generated videos (UGVs) lack a certain appeal because their soundtracks consist mostly of ambient background noise. Aimed at making UGVs more attractive, we introduce ADVISOR, a personalized video soundtrack recommendation system. We propose a fast and effective heuristic ranking approach based on heterogeneous late fusion by jointly considering three aspects: venue categories, visual scene, and user listening history. Specifically, we combine confidence scores, produced by SVMhmm models constructed from geographic, visual, and audio features, to obtain different types of video characteristics. Our contributions are threefold. First, we predict scene moods from a real-world video dataset that was collected from users' daily outdoor activities. Second, we perform heuristic rankings to fuse the predicted confidence scores of multiple models, and third we customize the video soundtrack recommendation functionality to make it compatible with mobile devices. A series of extensive experiments confirm that our approach performs well and recommends appealing soundtracks for UGVs to enhance the viewing experience.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Rajiv Ratn Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Rajiv_Ratn", "Yi Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Yi", "Roger Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann:Roger"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
