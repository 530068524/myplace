In many real-world applications, data can be represented in various heterogeneous features or views. Different views often provide different aspects of information that are complementary to each other. Several previous methods of clustering have demonstrated that better accuracy can be achieved using integrated information of all the views than just using each view individually. One important class of such methods is multi-view spectral clustering, which is based on graph Laplacian. However, existing methods are not applicable to large-scale problem for their high computational complexity. To this end, we propose a novel large-scale multi-view spectral clustering approach based on the bipartite graph. Our method uses local manifold fusion to integrate heterogeneous features. To improve efficiency, we approximate the similarity graphs using bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we show that our method can be easily extended to handle the out-of-sample problem. Extensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, where our method runs up to nearly 3000 times faster than the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Yeqing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yeqing", "Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Heng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heng", "Junzhou Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Junzhou"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
