{"title": "Towards Distributed Software Model-Checking Using Decision Diagrams.", "fields": ["symbolic trajectory evaluation", "binary decision diagram", "pointer", "symbolic computation", "symbolic data analysis"], "abstract": "Symbolic data structures such as Decision Diagrams have proved successful for model-checking. For high-level specifications such as those used in programming languages, especially when manipulating pointers or arrays, building and evaluating the transition is a challenging problem that limits wider applicability of symbolic methods.\n\nWe propose a new symbolic algorithm, EquivSplit, allowing an efficient and fully symbolic manipulation of transition relations on Data Decision Diagrams. It allows to work with equivalence classes of states rather than individual states. Experimental evidence on the concurrent software oriented benchmark BEEM shows that this approach is competitive.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Paris", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Maximilien Colange.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colange:Maximilien", "Souheib Baarir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baarir:Souheib", "Fabrice Kordon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kordon:Fabrice", "Yann Thierry-Mieg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thierry=Mieg:Yann"], "pages": 16}
