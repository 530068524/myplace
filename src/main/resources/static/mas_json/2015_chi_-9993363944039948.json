While we have a good understanding of the challenges of video conferencing in office or home environments, we do not fully understand the mechanics of camera work-how people use mobile devices to communicate with one another-during mobile video calls. To provide an understanding of what people do in mobile video collaboration, we conducted an observational study where pairs of participants completed tasks using a mobile video conferencing system. Our analysis suggests that people use the camera view deliberately to support their interactions-for example, to convey a message or to ask questions-but the limited field of view, and the lack of camera control can make it a frustrating experience.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Prince Edward Island", "Simon Fraser University", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Brennan Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones:Brennan", "Anna Witcraft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Witcraft:Anna", "Scott Bateman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bateman:Scott", "Carman Neustaedter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neustaedter:Carman", "Anthony Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Anthony"], "pages": 10}
