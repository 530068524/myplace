We show that parametric effect monads admit analogues of the structures and concepts that exist for monads, such as Kleisli triples, the state monad and the continuation monad, Plotkin and Power's algebraic operations, and the categorical \u252c\u252c-lifting. We also show a systematic method to generate both effects and a parametric effect monad from a monad morphism. Finally, we introduce two effect systems with explicit and implicit subeffecting, and discuss their denotational semantics and the soundness of effect systems.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Kyoto Univeristy, Kyoto, Japan"], "authors": ["Shin-ya Katsumata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katsumata:Shin=ya"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2014", "pages": 14}
