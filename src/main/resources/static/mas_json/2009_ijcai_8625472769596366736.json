However, most dimension reduction approaches are driven by objective functions that may not or only partially suit the end users requirements. In this work, we show how to incorporate general-purpose domain expertise encoded as a graph into dimension reduction in way that lends itself to an elegant generalized eigenvalue problem. We call our approach Graph-Driven Constrained Dimension Reduction via Linear Projection (GCDR-LP) and show that it has several desirable properties.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Ian Davidson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davidson:Ian"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
