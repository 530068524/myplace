{"title": "STRALE: Mobility-aware PHY rate and frame aggregation length adaptation in WLANs.", "fields": ["frame aggregation", "protocol overhead", "phy", "protocol data unit", "wi fi"], "abstract": "IEEE 802.11n/ac wireless local area network (WLAN) supports frame aggregation, called aggregate medium access control (MAC) protocol data unit (A-MPDU), to enhance MAC efficiency by reducing protocol overhead. However, the current channel estimation process conducted only once during the preamble reception is known to be insufficient to ensure robust delivery of long A-MPDU frames in mobile environments. To cope with this problem, we first build a model which represents the impact of mobility with a noise vector in the I-Q plane, and then analyze how the mobility affects the A-MPDU reception performance. Based on our analysis, we develop STRALE, a standard-compliant and mobility-aware PHY rate and A-MPDU length adaptation scheme with ease of implementation. Through extensive simulations with 802.11ac using ns-3 and prototype implementation with commercial 802.11n devices, we demonstrate that STRALE achieves up to 2.9x higher throughput, compared to a fixed duration setting according to IEEE 802.11 standard.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Seongho Byeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Byeon:Seongho", "Kangjin Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Kangjin", "Changmok Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Changmok", "Sunghyun Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Sunghyun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
