{"title": "Finding optimum abstractions in parametric dataflow analysis.", "fields": ["dataflow", "counterexample", "abstraction", "java", "parametric statistics"], "abstract": "We propose a technique to efficiently search a large family of abstractions in order to prove a query using a parametric dataflow analysis. Our technique either finds the cheapest such abstraction or shows that none exists. It is based on counterexample-guided abstraction refinement but applies a novel meta-analysis on abstract counterexample traces to efficiently find abstractions that are incapable of proving the query. We formalize the technique in a generic framework and apply it to two analyses: a type-state analysis and a thread-escape analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on a suite of Java benchmark programs.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Xin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xin", "Mayur Naik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naik:Mayur", "Hongseok Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Hongseok"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
