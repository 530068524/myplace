We define the size of the formula as the number of leaves in it. Proving that some explicit function (in P or NP) requires a large formula is a central open question in computational complexity. While we believe that some explicit functions require exponential formula size, currently the best lower bound for an explicit function is the I\u00a9( n  3 ) lower bound for Andreev\u00e2  s function.   A long line of work in quantum query complexity, culminating in the work of Reichardt [SODA, 2011], proved that for any formula of size  s , there exists a polynomial of degree at most  O (\u00e2   s ) that approximates the formula up to a small point-wise error. This is a classical theorem, arguing about polynomials and formulae, however the only known proof for it involves quantum algorithms.   We apply Reichardt result to obtain the following:   (1) We show how to trade average-case hardness in exchange for size. More precisely, we show that if a function  f  cannot be computed correctly on more than 1/2 + 2 \u00e2   k   of the inputs by any formula of size at most  s , then computing  f  exactly requires formula size at least I\u00a9( k ) \ufffd\u00b7  s . As an application, we improve the state of the art formula size lower bounds for explicit functions by a factor of I\u00a9(log n ).   (2) We prove that the bipartite formula size of the Inner-Product function is I\u00a9( n  2 ). (A bipartite formula on Boolean variables  x  1 , \u00e2 \ufffd,  x   n   and  y  1 , \u00e2 \ufffd,  y   n   is a binary tree whose internal nodes are marked with AND or OR gates and whose leaves can compute any function of either the  x  or  y  variables.) We show that any bipartite formula for the Inner-Product modulo 2 function, namely  IP ( x , y ) = \u00e2    i =1   n    x   i    y   i   ( mod  2), must be of size I\u00a9( n  2 ), which is tight up to logarithmic factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first super-linear lower bound on the bipartite formula complexity of any explicit function.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["IAS, USA"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Avishay Tal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tal:Avishay"], "pages": 13}
