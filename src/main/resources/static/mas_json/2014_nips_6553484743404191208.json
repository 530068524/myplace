Our original method is inspired by group testing theory, under which the feature selection procedure consists of a collection of randomized tests to be performed in parallel. Each test corresponds to a subset of features, for which a scoring function may be applied to measure the relevance of the features in a classification task. We develop a general theory providing sufficient conditions under which true features are guaranteed to be correctly identified. Superior performance of our method is demonstrated on a challenging relation extraction task from a very large data set that have both redundant features and sample size in the order of millions. We present comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art feature selection methods on a range of data sets, for which our method exhibits competitive performance in terms of running time and accuracy. Moreover, it also yields substantial speedup when used as a pre-processing step for most other existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University at Buffalo", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yingbo Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yingbo", "Utkarsh Porwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porwal:Utkarsh", "Ce Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ce", "Hung Q.
