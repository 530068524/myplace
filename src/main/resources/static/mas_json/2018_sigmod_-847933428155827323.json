Dialog interface enables users to automatically exploit the semantic context of the conversation while asking natural language queries over RDBMS, thereby making it simpler to express complex questions in a natural, piece-wise manner. We propose novel ontology-driven techniques for addressing each of the dialog-specific challenges such as co-reference resolution, ellipsis resolution, and query disambiguation, and use them in determining the overall intent of the user query. We demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of dialog interface over two different domains viz. finance and healthcare.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ashish R.
