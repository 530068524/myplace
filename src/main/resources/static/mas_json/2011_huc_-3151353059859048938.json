Although many current solutions exist to provide ubiquitous access to one's data, users continue to struggle with cross-device tasks. These solutions often require them to plan ahead for their information needs. In this paper, we present Myngle, a device-agnostic system that lets users quickly find the information they are looking for from previously visited web pages without having to plan ahead. Myngle provides a unified web history from multiple personal devices, and allows users to filter their history based on high-level categories influenced by common mobile information need categories (e.g., address, phone number). We evaluated Myngle with 32 users and found that our category-based method of filtering eases the burden of continuing cross-device tasks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Nokia", "University of Toronto", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Timothy Sohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohn:Timothy", "Frank Chun Yat Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Frank_Chun_Yat", "Agathe Battestini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Battestini:Agathe", "Vidya Setlur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Setlur:Vidya", "Koichi Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Koichi", "Hiroshi Horii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horii:Hiroshi"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
