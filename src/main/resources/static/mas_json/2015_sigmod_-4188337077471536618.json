In this tutorial, we survey recent developments in the emerging area of database systems tailored for data exploration. We discuss new ideas on how to store and access data as well as new ideas on how to interact with a data system to enable users and applications to quickly figure out which data parts are of interest. In addition, we discuss how to exploit lessons-learned from past research, the new challenges data exploration crafts, emerging applications and future research directions.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Brandeis University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Stratos Idreos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Idreos:Stratos", "Olga Papaemmanouil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papaemmanouil:Olga", "Surajit Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Surajit"], "pages": 5}
