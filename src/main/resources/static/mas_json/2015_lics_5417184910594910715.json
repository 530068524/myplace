{"title": "Programs for Cheap!", "fields": ["operator", "recursion", "correctness", "semantics", "automated theorem proving"], "abstract": "Write down the definition of a recursion operator on a piece of paper. Tell me its type, but be careful not to let me see the operator's definition. I will tell you an optimization theorem that the operator satisfies. As an added bonus, I will also give you a proof of correctness for the optimisation, along with a formal guarantee about its effect on performance. The purpose of this paper is to explain these tricks.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Jennifer Hackett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hackett:Jennifer", "Graham Hutton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hutton:Graham"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
