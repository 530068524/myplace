We explore this question in the context of tweet search and temporal feedback: starting with an initial set of results from a baseline retrieval model, we estimate the temporal density of relevant documents, which is then used for result reranking. Our contributions lie in a method to characterize this temporal density function using kernel density estimation, with and without human relevance judgments, and an approach to integrating this information into a standard retrieval model. Experiments on TREC datasets confirm that our temporal feedback formulation improves search effectiveness, thus providing support for our hypothesis. Our approach out-performs both a standard baseline and previous temporal retrieval models. Temporal feedback improves over standard lexical feedback (with and without human judgments), illus- trating that temporal relevance signals exist independently of document content.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica"], "authors": ["Miles Efron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efron:Miles", "Jimmy J.
