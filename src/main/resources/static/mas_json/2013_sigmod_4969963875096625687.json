Many of these data sources can be modeled as multi-relational graphs. Mining and searching for subgraph patterns in a continuous setting requires an efficient approach to incremental graph search. The goal of our work is to enable real-time search capabilities for graph databases. This demonstration will present a dynamic graph query system that leverages the structural and semantic characteristics of the underlying multi-relational graph.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Washington State University", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Washington State University", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sutanay Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Sutanay", "Lawrence B.
