{"title": "An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores.", "fields": ["source lines of code", "kernel", "htree", "scalability", "linux kernel"], "abstract": "This paper analyzes the scalability of seven system applications (Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce) running on Linux on a 48- core computer. Except for gmake, all applications trigger scalability bottlenecks inside a recent Linux kernel. Using mostly standard parallel programming techniques-- this paper introduces one new technique, sloppy counters-- these bottlenecks can be removed from the kernel or avoided by changing the applications slightly. Modifying the kernel required in total 3002 lines of code changes. A speculative conclusion from this analysis is that there is no scalability reason to give up on traditional operating system organizations just yet.", "citation": "Citations (396)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Silas Boyd-Wickizer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boyd=Wickizer:Silas", "Austin T.
