While context models have been quite popular, previous works mainly concentrate onco-occurrence relationship within classes and few of them focus on contextualization from a top-down perspective, i.e. high-level task context. In this paper, our system adopts a new method for adaptive context modeling and iterative boosting. First, the contextualized support vector machine (Context-SVM) is proposed, where the context takes the role of dynamically adjusting the classification score based on the sample ambiguity, and thus the context-adaptive classifier is achieved. Then, an iterative training procedure is presented. In each step, Context-SVM, associated with the output context from one task (object classification or detection), is instantiated to boost the performance for the other task, whose augmented outputs are then further used to improve the former task by Context-SVM. The proposed solution is evaluated on the object classification and detection tasks of PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge (VOC) 2007, 2010 and SUN09 data sets, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.", "citation": "Citations (250)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IBM", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Panasonic", "Panasonic", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Panasonic", "Panasonic", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zheng Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Zheng", "Qiang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0007:Qiang", "ZhongYang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:ZhongYang", "Yang Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Yang", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng"], "pages": 8}
