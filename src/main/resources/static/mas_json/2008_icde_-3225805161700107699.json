In this paper we provide an analytical explanation for this phenomenon. In a first large-scale study of the space complexity of evaluating XPath queries over indexed XML documents we show the space to depend on three factors: (1) whether the query is a path or a tree; (2) the types of axes occurring in the query and their occurrence pattern; and (3) the mode of query evaluation (filtering, full- fledged, or \"pattern matching\"). Our lower bounds imply that evaluation of a large class of queries that have child-axis nodes indeed requires large space. Our study also reveals that on some queries there is a large gap between the space needed for pattern matching and the space needed for full-fledged evaluation or filtering. This implies that many existing twig join algorithms, which work in the pattern matching mode, incur significant space overhead. We present a new twig join algorithm that avoids this overhead. On certain queries our algorithm is exceedingly more space-efficient than existing algorithms, sometimes bringing the space down from linear in the document size to constant.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mirit Shalem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalem:Mirit", "Ziv Bar-Yossef.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bar=Yossef:Ziv"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
