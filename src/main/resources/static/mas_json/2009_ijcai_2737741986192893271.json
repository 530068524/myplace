{"title": "K-Swaps: Cooperative Negotiation for Solving Task-Allocation Problems.", "fields": ["negotiation", "distributed algorithm", "swap", "computation", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study distributed algorithms for cooperative agents that allow them to exchange their assigned tasks in order to reduce their team cost. We define a new type of contract, called K-swaps, that describes multiple task exchanges among multiple agents at a time, which generalizes the concept of single task exchanges. We design a distributed algorithm that constructs all possible K-swaps that reduce the team cost of a given task allocation and show that each agent typically only needs to communicate a small part of its local computation results to the other agents. We then demonstrate empirically that K-swaps can reduce the team costs of several existing task-allocation algorithms significantly even if K is small.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Xiaoming Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Xiaoming", "Sven Koenig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koenig:Sven"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
