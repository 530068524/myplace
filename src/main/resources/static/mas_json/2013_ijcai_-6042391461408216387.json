Qualitative algebras are used as spatial and temporal knowledge representation languages. The intuition behind this adaptation approach is to apply a substitution and then repair potential inconsistencies, thanks to belief revision on qualitative algebras. A temporal example from the cooking domain is given.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Lorraine", "University of Strasbourg", "University of Lorraine", "Aster"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Valmi Dufour-Lussier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dufour=Lussier:Valmi", "Florence Le Ber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ber:Florence_Le", "Jean Lieber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lieber:Jean", "Laura Martin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martin:Laura"], "pages": 5}
