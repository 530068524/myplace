In order to be effective, a heuristic must be efficient to compute, as well as provide useful information to the search algorithm. However, some well-known heuristics which do well in reducing backtracking are so heavy that the gain of deploying them in a search algorithm might be outweighed by their overhead.\n\nWe propose a rational metareasoning approach to decide when to deploy heuristics, using CSP backtracking search as a case study. In particular, a value of information approach is taken to adaptive deployment of solution-count estimation heuristics for value ordering. Empirical results show that indeed the proposed mechanism successfully balances the tradeoff between decreasing backtracking and heuristic computational overhead, resulting in a significant overall search time reduction.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["David Tolpin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tolpin:David", "Solomon Eyal Shimony.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimony:Solomon_Eyal"], "pages": 7}
