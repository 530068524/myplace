The paper studies how design projects proceed from the fuzzy early phases towards the issues of central relevance to designing. A central concept is framing, and it is elaborated with examples from two case studies. Several aspects of framing are explicated, exploratory, anticipatory and social framing, and related concepts of 'focusing', 'priming', and 'grounding' are explained. The paper concludes that understanding designing as a situated and constructive making of meaning has bearings on how designing needs to be supported.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "The University  ... lsinki, Finland"], "authors": ["Salu Ylirisku.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ylirisku:Salu", "Virtu Halttunen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halttunen:Virtu", "Johanna Nuojua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nuojua:Johanna", "Antti Juustila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juustila:Antti"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
