Different from previous works, we consider a scenario where the eavesdroppers can be located anywhere inside the communication region of the source, no location information of the eavesdroppers is available and no constraint on the number of eavesdroppers is presupposed. The basic idea is to transmit the message in multiple rounds and exploit the helpful interference from the source and the destination to jam the eavesdroppers in close proximity. Stochastic geometry based analytic results as well as Monte Carlo simulations are presented to illustrate the achievable secrecy performances.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Xidian University", "Xidian University", "Tohoku University", "Xidian University", "Xidian University"], "authors": ["Zhihong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhihong", "Jiajia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jiajia", "Nei Kato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kato:Nei", "Jianfeng Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Jianfeng", "Qiping Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Qiping"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
