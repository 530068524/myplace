{"title": "VRRRRoom: Virtual Reality for Radiologists in the Reading Room.", "fields": ["interaction design", "immersion", "virtual reality", "multimedia", "human computer interaction"], "abstract": "Reading room conditions such as illumination, ambient light, human factors and display luminance, play an important role on how radiologists analyze and interpret images. Indeed, serious diagnostic errors can appear when observing images through everyday monitors. Typically, these occur whenever professionals are ill-positioned with respect to the display or visualize images under improper light and luminance conditions. In this work, we show that virtual reality can assist radiodiagnostics by considerably diminishing or cancel out the effects of unsuitable ambient conditions. Our approach combines immersive head-mounted displays with interactive surfaces to support professional radiologists in analyzing medical images and formulating diagnostics. We evaluated our prototype with two senior medical doctors and four seasoned radiology fellows. Results indicate that our approach constitutes a viable, flexible, portable and cost-efficient option to traditional radiology reading rooms.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Lisbon", "University of Lisbon", "INESC-ID", "University of Lisbon", "University of Lisbon"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Maur\u00edcio Sousa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sousa:Maur=iacute=cio", "Daniel Mendes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mendes:Daniel", "Soraia Paulo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paulo:Soraia", "Nuno Matela.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matela:Nuno", "Joaquim A.
