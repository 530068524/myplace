In contrast, we define and offer solutions to why-not questions on MPRQ. Given an original metric probabilistic range query and a why-not set W of uncertain objects that are absent from the query result, a why-not question on MPRQ explains why the uncertain objects in W do not appear in the query result, and provides refinements of the original query and/or W with the minimal penalty, so that the uncertain objects in W appear in the result of the refined query. Specifically, we propose a framework that consists of three efficient solutions, one that modifies the original query, one that modifies the why-not set, and one that modifies both the original query and the why-not set. Extensive experiments using both real and synthetic data sets offer insights into the properties of the proposed algorithms, and show that they are effective and efficient.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Aalborg University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Lu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lu", "Yunjun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yunjun", "Kai Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kai", "Christian S.
