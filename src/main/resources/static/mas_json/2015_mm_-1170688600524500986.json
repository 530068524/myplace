{"title": "Image2Scene: Transforming Style of 3D Room.", "fields": ["computer vision", "multimedia", "computer graphics images", "computer science", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "We propose a style transformation system to transform a 3D room into one that resembles the style of a photograph. We focus on two major components of interior scene style: layout and color. Using an interior image database, we learn the related style guidelines. Given a reference image and a 3D room of two different interior rooms, we first establish semantic correspondence between the two scenes. The styles of the reference image are then extracted in the form of layout constraints and color schemes. Finally, our framework performs layout rearrangement followed by recoloring of the scene to match the learned style of the reference image. We show style transformation results on numerous examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beijing Union University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University"], "authors": ["Xiaowu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiaowu", "Jianwei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianwei", "Qing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qing", "Bo Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Bo", "Dongqing Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou:Dongqing", "Qinping Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Qinping"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
