Sparsity pattern recovery arises in a number of settings including statistical model selection, pattern detection, and image acquisition. The main results in this paper are necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotically-reliable sparsity pattern recovery in terms of the dimensions m, n and k as well as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the minimum-to-average ratio (MAR) of the nonzero entries of the signal. We show that m > 2k log(n - k)/(SNR \u00b7 MAR) is necessary for any algorithm to succeed, regardless of complexity; this matches a previous sufficient condition for maximum likelihood estimation within a constant factor under certain scalings of k, SNR and MAR with n. We also show a sufficient condition for a computationally-trivial thresholding algorithm that is larger than the previous expression by only a factor of 4(1 + SNR) and larger than the requirement for lasso by only a factor of 4/MAR. This provides insight on the precise value and limitations of convex programming-based algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Qualcomm", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alyson K.
