The theorem states that for every fixed-size grid  H , every graph whose treewidth is large enough, contains  H  as a minor. This theorem has found many applications in graph theory and algorithms. Let  f ( k ) denote the largest value, such that every graph of treewidth  k  contains a grid minor of size  f ( k ) \u00d7  f ( k ). The best current quantitative bound, due to recent work of Kawarabayashi and Kobayashi [15], and Leaf and Seymour [18], shows that  f ( k ) = \u03a9(\u221alog k /loglog k ). In contrast, the best known upper bound implies that  f ( k ) =  O (\u221a k /log k ) [22]. In this paper we obtain the first polynomial relationship between treewidth and grid-minor size by showing that  f ( k ) = \u03a9( k   \u0394  ) for some fixed constant  \u0394  > 0, and describe an algorithm, whose running time is polynomial in | V  ( G )| and  k , that finds a model of such a grid-minor in  G .", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Chandra Chekuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chekuri:Chandra", "Julia Chuzhoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuzhoy:Julia"], "pages": 10}
