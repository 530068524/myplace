{"title": "A Layered Fabric 3D Printer for Soft Interactive Objects.", "fields": ["laser cutting", "3d printing", "rapid prototyping", "led display", "layer by layer"], "abstract": "We present a new type of 3D printer that can form precise, but soft and deformable 3D objects from layers of off-the-shelf fabric. Our printer employs an approach where a sheet of fabric forms each layer of a 3D object. The printer cuts this sheet along the 2D contour of the layer using a laser cutter and then bonds it to previously printed layers using a heat sensitive adhesive. Surrounding fabric in each layer is temporarily retained to provide a removable support structure for layers printed above it. This process is repeated to build up a 3D object layer by layer. Our printer is capable of automatically feeding two separate fabric types into a single print. This allows specially cut layers of conductive fabric to be embedded in our soft prints. Using this capability we demonstrate 3D models with touch sensing capability built into a soft print in one complete printing process, and a simple LED display making use of a conductive fabric coil for wireless power reception.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Disney Research"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Huaishu Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Huaishu", "Jennifer Mankoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mankoff:Jennifer", "Scott E.
