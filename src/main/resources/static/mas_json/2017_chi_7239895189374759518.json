However, these kits present a high barrier of entry for some users, particularly young children (K-6). In this paper, we introduce MakerWear, a new wearable construction kit for children that uses a tangible, modular approach to wearable creation. We describe our participatory design process, the iterative development of MakerWear, and results from single- and multi-session workshops with 32 children (ages 5-12; M=8.3 years). Our findings reveal how children engage in wearable design, what they make (and want to make), and what challenges they face. As a secondary analysis, we also explore age-related differences.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Majeed Kazemitabaar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazemitabaar:Majeed", "Jason McPeak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McPeak:Jason", "Alexander Jiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiao:Alexander", "Liang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Liang", "Thomas Outing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Outing:Thomas", "Jon E.
