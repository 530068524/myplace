The main contribution of the paper is to propose a novel CSMA policy, called Unlocking CSMA (U-CSMA), that enables to obtain both high throughput and low packet delays in large wireless networks. More precisely, we show that for torus interference graph topologies with one-hop traffic, U-CSMA is throughput optimal and achieves order-optimal delay. For one-hop traffic, the delay performance is defined to be order-optimal if the delay stays bounded as the network-size increases. Simulations that we conducted suggest that (a) U-CSMA is throughput-optimal and achieves order-optimal delay for general geometric interference graphs and (b) that U-CSMA can be combined with congestion control algorithms to maximize the network-wide utility and obtain order-optimal delay. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a simple distributed scheduling policy has been proposed that is both throughput/utility optimal and achieves order-optimal delay.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mahdi Lotfinezhad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lotfinezhad:Mahdi", "Peter Marbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marbach:Peter"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
