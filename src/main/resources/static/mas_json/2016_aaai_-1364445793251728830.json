TFPGs are a very rich formalism: they allow to model Boolean combinations of faults and events, also dependent on the operational modes of the system and quantitative delays between them. TFPGs are often produced manually, from a given dynamic system of greater complexity, as abstract representations of the system behavior under specific faulty conditions.\n\nIn this paper we tackle two key difficulties in this process: first, how to make sure that no important behavior of the system is overlooked in the TFPG, and that no spurious, nonexistent behavior is introduced; second, how to devise the correct values for the delays between events. We propose a model checking approach to automatically validate the completeness and tightness of a TFPG for a given infinite-state dynamic system, and a procedure for the automated synthesis of the delay parameters. The proposed approach is evaluated on a number of synthetic and industrial benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler"], "authors": ["Benjamin Bittner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bittner:Benjamin", "Marco Bozzano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bozzano:Marco", "Alessandro Cimatti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cimatti:Alessandro", "Gianni Zampedri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zampedri:Gianni"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
