{"title": "How small can you go?: analyzing the effect of visual angle in pointing tasks.", "fields": ["wireless", "visual angle", "minute of arc", "computer vision", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "People are increasingly using wireless mice from across rooms as they use computers as entertainment centers. As a consequence, they often have to point at targets occupying small visual angles. In this note we present the results of a study on pointing performance for targets occupying small visual angles. Our results suggest there is a steep degradation of pointing performance in both accuracy and speed for targets occupying a visual angle below 3 minutes of arc.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Iowa", "University of Iowa"], "authors": ["Juan Pablo Hourcade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hourcade:Juan_Pablo", "Natasha E.
