{"title": "When Social Influence Meets Item Inference.", "fields": ["statistical inference", "viral marketing", "maximization", "baseline", "inference"], "abstract": "Research issues and data mining techniques for product recommendation and viral marketing have been widely studied. Existing works on seed selection in social networks do not take into account the effect of product recommendations in e-commerce stores. In this paper, we investigate the seed selection problem for viral marketing that considers both effects of social influence and item inference (for product recommendation). We develop a new model,  Social Item Graph (SIG) , that captures both effects in the form of hyperedges. Accordingly, we formulate a seed selection problem, called  Social Item Maximization Problem (SIMP) , and prove the hardness of SIMP. We design an efficient algorithm with performance guarantee, called Hyperedge-Aware Greedy (HAG), for SIMP and develop a new index structure, called SIG-index, to accelerate the computation of diffusion process in HAG. Moreover, to construct realistic SIG models for SIMP, we develop a statistical inference based framework to learn the weights of hyperedges from data. Finally, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on our proposals with various baselines. Experimental result validates our ideas and demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithms over baselines.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Hui-Ju Hung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hung:Hui=Ju", "Hong-Han Shuai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shuai:Hong=Han", "De-Nian Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:De=Nian", "Liang-Hao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Liang=Hao", "Wang-Chien Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wang=Chien", "Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian", "Ming-Syan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ming=Syan"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
