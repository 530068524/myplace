{"title": "Coming of Age (Digitally): An Ecological View of Social Media Use among College Students.", "fields": ["social media", "ecological psychology", "distraction", "mood", "entertainment"], "abstract": "We take an ecological approach to studying social media use and its relation to mood among college students. We conducted a mixed-methods study of computer and phone logging with daily surveys and interviews to track college students' use of social media during all waking hours over seven days. Continual and infrequent checkers show different preferences of social media sites. Age differences also were found. Lower classmen tend to be heavier users and to primarily use Facebook, while upper classmen use social media less frequently and utilize sites other than Facebook more often. Factor analysis reveals that social media use clusters into patterns of content-sharing, text-based entertainment/discussion, relationships, and video consumption. The more constantly one checks social media daily, the less positive is one's mood. Our results suggest that students construct their own patterns of social media usage to meet their changing needs in their environment. The findings can inform further investigation into social media use as a benefit and/or distraction for students.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Yiran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yiran", "Melissa Niiya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niiya:Melissa", "Gloria Mark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mark:Gloria", "Stephanie M.
