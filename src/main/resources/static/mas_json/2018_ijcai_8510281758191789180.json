{"title": "Hi-Fi: Hierarchical Feature Integration for Skeleton Detection.", "fields": ["machine learning", "convolutional neural network", "skeleton", "semantics", "architecture"], "abstract": "In natural images, skeleton scales (thickness) may significantly vary among objects and object parts. Thus, robust skeleton detection requires more powerful multi-scale feature integration ability than other vision tasks. In this paper, we present a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture by introducing a novel hierarchical feature integration mechanism, named Hi-Fi, to address the object skeleton detection problem. CNNs can capture high-level semantics from deeper layers as well as low-level details from shallower layers. \nBy hierarchically integrating convolutional features with bi-direction guidance, our approach (1) enables mutual refinement across features of different levels, and (2) possesses strong ability to capture both rich object context and high-resolution details. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectively fusing features from very different scales, as evidenced by a considerable performance improvement on skeleton detection. Our method also refreshes the state-of-the-art performance of boundary detection task.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nankai University", "Shanghai University", "Nankai University", "Shanghai University", "Nankai University"], "authors": ["Kai Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Kai", "Wei Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Wei", "Shanghua Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Shanghua", "Dandan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dandan", "Ming-Ming Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Ming=Ming"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
