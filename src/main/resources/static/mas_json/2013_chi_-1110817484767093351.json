{"title": "VideoKheti: making video content accessible to low-literate and novice users.", "fields": ["agricultural extension", "graphics", "information and communications technology", "ranging", "literacy"], "abstract": "Designing ICT systems for rural users in the developing world is difficult for a variety of reasons ranging from problems with infrastructure to wide differences in user contexts and capabilities. Developing regions may include huge variability in spoken languages, and users are often low- or non-literate, with very little experience interacting with digital technologies. Researchers have explored the use of text-free graphical interfaces as well as speech-based applications to overcome some of the issues related to language and literacy. While there are benefits and drawbacks to each of these approaches, they can be complementary when used together. In this work, we present VideoKheti, a mobile system using speech, graphics, and touch interaction for low-literate farmers in rural India. VideoKheti helps farmers to find and watch agricultural extension videos in their own language and dialect. In this paper, we detail the design and development of VideoKheti and report on a field study with 20 farmers in rural India who were asked to find videos based on a scenario. The results show that farmers could use VideoKheti, but their success still greatly depended on their education level. While participants were enthusiastic about using the system, the multimodal interface did not overcome many obstacles for low-literate users.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["S\u00e9bastien Cuendet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cuendet:S=eacute=bastien", "Indrani Medhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medhi:Indrani", "Kalika Bali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bali:Kalika", "Edward Cutrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cutrell:Edward"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
