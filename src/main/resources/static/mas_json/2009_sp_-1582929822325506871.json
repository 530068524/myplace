Native Client aims to give browser-based applications the computational performance of native applications without compromising safety. Native Client uses software fault isolation and a secure runtime to direct system interaction and side effects through interfaces managed by Native Client. Native Client provides operating system portability for binary code while supporting performance-oriented features generally absent from web application programming environments, such as thread support, instruction set extensions such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and hand-coded assembler. We combine these properties in an open architecture that encourages community review and 3rd-party tools.", "citation": "Citations (660)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Bennet Yee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yee:Bennet", "David Sehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sehr:David", "Gregory Dardyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dardyk:Gregory", "J.
