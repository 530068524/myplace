{"title": "Approximating Hierarchical MV-sets for Hierarchical Clustering.", "fields": ["hierarchical clustering of networks", "graph", "density estimation", "hierarchical clustering", "convex optimization"], "abstract": "The goal of hierarchical clustering is to construct a cluster tree, which can be viewed as the modal structure of a density. For this purpose, we use a convex optimization program that can efficiently estimate a family of hierarchical dense sets in high-dimensional distributions. We further extend existing graph-based methods to approximate the cluster tree of a distribution. By avoiding direct density estimation, our method is able to handle high-dimensional data more efficiently than existing density-based approaches. We present empirical results that demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing ones.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Assaf Glazer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glazer:Assaf", "Omer Weissbrod.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weissbrod:Omer", "Michael Lindenbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindenbaum:Michael", "Shaul Markovitch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markovitch:Shaul"], "pages": 9}
