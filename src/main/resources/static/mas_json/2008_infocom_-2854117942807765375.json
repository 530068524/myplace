The Controller has a limitation on the amount of information it can conceal. We formulate this problem as a game and compute the most harmful behavior of the Controller and the best choice of a resource for the Actor. We identify cases in which the exact solution is computationally intractable, and provide approximate solutions with polynomial complexity.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Citigroup"], "authors": ["Saswati Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar:Saswati", "Eitan Altman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altman:Eitan", "Rachid El Azouzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azouzi:Rachid_El", "Yezekael Hayel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayel:Yezekael"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
