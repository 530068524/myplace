{"title": "Accuracy-Aware Uncertain Stream Databases.", "fields": ["query optimization", "tuple", "end user", "raw data", "view"], "abstract": "Previous work has introduced probability distributions as first-class components in uncertain stream database systems. A lacking element is the fact of how accurate these probability distributions are. This indeed has a profound impact on the accuracy of query results presented to end users. While there is some previous work that studies unreliable intermediate query results in the tuple uncertainty model, to the best of our know-ledge, we are the first to consider an uncertain stream database in which accuracy is taken into consideration all the way from the learned distributions based on raw data samples to the query results. We perform an initial study of various components in an accuracy-aware uncertain stream database system, including the representation of accuracy information and how to obtain query results' accuracy. In addition, we propose novel predicates based on hypothesis testing for decision-making using data with limited accuracy. We augment our study with a comprehensive set of experimental evaluations.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Kentucky", "University of Kentucky"], "authors": ["Tingjian Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Tingjian", "Fujun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Fujun"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
