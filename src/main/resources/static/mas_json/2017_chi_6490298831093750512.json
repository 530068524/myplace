Flexibles add expressive deformation input to interaction with on-screen tangibles. Based on different types of deformation mapping, we contribute a set of 3D-printable mechanisms that capture pressing, squeezing, and bending input with multiple levels of intensities. They can be integrated into 3D printed objects with custom geometries and on different locations. A Flexible is printed in a single pass on a consumer-level 3D printer without requiring further assembly. Through a series of interactive prototypes, example applications and a technical evaluation, we show the technical feasibility and the wide applicability of Flexibles.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Saarland University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Synaptics, Zug, Switzerland"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Martin Schmitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmitz:Martin", "J\u00fcrgen Steimle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steimle:J=uuml=rgen", "Jochen Huber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huber:Jochen", "Niloofar Dezfuli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dezfuli:Niloofar", "Max M\u00fchlh\u00e4user.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=hlh=auml=user:Max"], "pages": 14}
