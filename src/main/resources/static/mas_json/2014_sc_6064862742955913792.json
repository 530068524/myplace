{"title": "Petascale High Order Dynamic Rupture Earthquake Simulations on Heterogeneous Supercomputers.", "fields": ["coprocessor", "multiphysics", "petascale computing", "discontinuous galerkin method", "xeon phi"], "abstract": "We present an end-to-end optimization of the innovative Arbitrary high-order DERivative Discontinuous Galerkin (ADER-DG) software SeisSol targeting Intel \u00ae  Xeon Phi \u2122  coprocessor platforms, achieving unprecedented earthquake model complexity through coupled simulation of full frictional sliding and seismic wave propagation. SeisSol exploits unstructured meshes to flexibly adapt for complicated geometries in realistic geological models. Seismic wave propagation is solved simultaneously with earthquake faulting in a multiphysical manner leading to a heterogeneous solver structure. Our architecture-aware optimizations deliver up to 50% of peak performance, and introduce an efficient compute--communication overlapping scheme shadowing the multiphysics computations. SeisSol delivers near-optimal weak scaling, reaching 8.6 DP-PFLOPS on 8,192 nodes of the Tianhe-2 supercomputer. Our performance model projects reaching 18--20 DP-PFLOPS on the full Tianhe-2 machine. Of special relevance to modern civil engineering needs, our pioneering simulation of the 1992 Landers earthquake shows highly detailed rupture evolution and ground motion at frequencies up to 10 Hz.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Alexander Heinecke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinecke:Alexander", "Alexander Breuer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Breuer:Alexander", "Sebastian Rettenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rettenberger:Sebastian", "Michael Bader.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bader:Michael", "Alice-Agnes Gabriel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gabriel:Alice=Agnes", "Christian Pelties.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pelties:Christian", "Arndt Bode.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bode:Arndt", "William Barth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barth:William", "Xiangke Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Xiangke", "Karthikeyan Vaidyanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaidyanathan:Karthikeyan", "Mikhail Smelyanskiy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smelyanskiy:Mikhail", "Pradeep Dubey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dubey:Pradeep"], "pages": 12}
