{"title": "Materializing Inferred and Uncertain Knowledge in RDF Datasets.", "fields": ["query optimization", "schema", "rdf", "inference", "bit array"], "abstract": "There is a growing need for efficient and scalable semantic web queries that handle inference. There is also a growing interest in representing uncertainty in semantic web knowledge bases. In this paper, we present a bit vector schema specifically designed for RDF (Resource Description Framework) datasets. We propose a system for materializing and storing inferred knowledge using this schema. We show experimental results that demonstrate that our solution drastically improves the performance of inference queries. We also propose a solution for materializing uncertain information and probabilities using multiple bit vectors and thresholds.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["James P.
