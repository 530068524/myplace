{"title": "Facilitating fashion camouflage art.", "fields": ["face detection", "painting", "digital art", "facial recognition system", "camouflage"], "abstract": "Artists and fashion designers have recently been creating a new form of art -- Camouflage Art -- which can be used to prevent computer vision algorithms from detecting faces. This digital art technique combines makeup and hair styling, or other modifications such as facial painting to help avoid automatic face-detection. In this paper, we first study the camouflage interference and its effectiveness on several current state of art techniques in face detection/recognition; and then present a tool that can facilitate digital art design for such camouflage that can fool these computer vision algorithms. This tool can find the prominent or decisive features from facial images that constitute the face being recognized; and give suggestions for camouflage options (makeup, styling, paints) on particular facial features or facial parts. Testing of this tool shows that it can effectively aid the artists or designers in creating camouflage-thwarting designs. The evaluation on suggested camouflages applied on 40 celebrities across eight different face recognition systems (both non-commercial or commercial) shows that 82.5% ~ 100% of times the subject is unrecognizable using the suggested camouflage.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Ranran Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Ranran", "Balakrishnan Prabhakaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakaran:Balakrishnan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
