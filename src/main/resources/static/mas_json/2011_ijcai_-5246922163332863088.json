{"title": "Manipulation in Group Argument Evaluation.", "fields": ["social choice theory", "argumentation theory", "argumentation framework", "pareto principle", "group decision making"], "abstract": "Given an argumentation framework and a group of agents, the individuals may have divergent opinions on the status of the arguments. If the group needs to reach a common position on the argumentation framework, the question is how the individual evaluations can be mapped into a collective one. This problem has been recently investigated by Caminada and Pigozzi. In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of two of such operators from a social choice-theoretic point of view. In particular, we study under which conditions these operators are Pareto optimal and whether they are manipulable.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University", "University of Luxembourg", "Paris Dauphine University", "University of Luxembourg", "SnT, Universit\u00e9 ... rg, Luxembourg", "ILIAS / SnT, Un ... rg, Luxembourg"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Martin Caminada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caminada:Martin", "Gabriella Pigozzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pigozzi:Gabriella", "Mikolaj Podlaszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podlaszewski:Mikolaj"], "pages": 6}
