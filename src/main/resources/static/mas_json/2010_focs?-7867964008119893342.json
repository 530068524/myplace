A branching program is regular if the in-degree of every vertex in it is either $0$ or $2$. For every width $d$ and length $n$, our pseudorandom generator uses a seed of length $O((\\log d + \\log\\log n + \\log(1/\\epsilon))\\log n)$ to produce $n$ bits that cannot be distinguished from a uniformly random string by any regular width $d$ length $n$ read-once branching program, except with probability $\\epsilon$. We also give a result for general read-once branching programs, in the case that there are no vertices that are reached with small probability. We show that if a (possibly non-regular) branching program of length $n$ and width $d$ has the property that every vertex in the program is traversed with probability at least $\\gamma$ on a uniformly random input, then the error of the generator above is at most $2 \\epsilon/\\gamma^2$.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Washington", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "University of Washington", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Mark Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Mark", "Anup Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Anup", "Ran Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Ran", "Amir Yehudayoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yehudayoff:Amir"], "pages": 8}
