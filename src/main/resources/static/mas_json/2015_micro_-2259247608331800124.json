{"title": "CLEAN-ECC: high reliability ECC for adaptive granularity memory system.", "fields": ["uniform memory access", "interleaved memory", "registered memory", "memory protection", "granularity"], "abstract": "Adaptive-granularity memory architectures have been considered mainly because of main memory bottleneck and power efficiency. Meanwhile, highly reliable protection schemes are getting popular especially in large computing systems. Unfortunately, conventional ECC mechanisms including  Chipkill  require a large number of symbols to guarantee strong protection with acceptable overhead. We propose a novel memory protection scheme called CLEAN (Chipkill-LEvel reliable and Access granularity Negotiable), which enables us to balance the contradicting demands of fine-grained (FG) access and strong & efficient ECC. To close a potentially significant detection coverage gap due to CLEAN's detection mechanism coupled with permanent faults, we design a simple mechanism access granularity enforcement. By enforcing coarse-grained (CG) access, we can get only the advantage of higher protection comparable to  Chipkill  instead of achieving the adaptive access granularity together. CLEAN showed  Chipkill  level reliability as well as improvement in performance, system and memory power efficiency by up to 11.8%, 10.8% and 64.9% with mixes of SPEC2006 benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Nvidia", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Seong-Lyong Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Seong=Lyong", "Minsoo Rhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhu:Minsoo", "Jungrae Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jungrae", "Jinsuk Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Jinsuk", "Mattan Erez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erez:Mattan"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
