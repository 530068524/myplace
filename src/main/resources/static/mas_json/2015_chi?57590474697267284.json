{"title": "Mediating Attention for Second Screen Companion Content.", "fields": ["multimedia", "human computer interaction", "broadcasting", "second screen", "computer science"], "abstract": "There is increasing interest in providing content to users on secondary devices while they watch TV. This material, termed companion content, can be anything from textual information, to interactive quiz games. It can be delivered throughout a broadcast and often directly relates to specific scenes in a show. This new scenario has exposed a challenging design space for creators of both the content and the enabling technology. A key question when introducing content on a secondary device is how much it detracts from, or enhances, the show the user is currently engaged with. To examine this, we investigated methods for mediating attention from the TV and onto a secondary device. By examining a typical use case we have been able to gain new insights into how best to design additional stimuli to alert users to companion content from both a broadcasting, and an HCI perspective.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Swansea University", "Swansea University", "BBC Research & Development"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Timothy Neate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neate:Timothy", "Matt Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones_0001:Matt", "Michael Evans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Evans:Michael"], "pages": 4}
