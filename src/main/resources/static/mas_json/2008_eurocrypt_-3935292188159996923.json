We show that any 2n-bit to n-bit compression function will have unacceptable collision resistance it makes fewer than three n-bit permutation invocations, and any 3n-bit to 2n-bit compression function will have unacceptable security if it makes fewer than five n-bit permutation invocations. Any rate-a hash function built from n-bit permutations can be broken, in the sense of finding preimages as well as collisions, in about N1-\u03b1 queries, where N = 2n. Our results provide guidance when trying to design or analyze a permutation-based hash function about the limits of what can possibly be done.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Phillip Rogaway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogaway:Phillip", "John P.
