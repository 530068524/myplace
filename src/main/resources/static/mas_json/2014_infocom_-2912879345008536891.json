Leveraging the elastic resource provisioning of the cloud, it is believed that VoD applications should attain high performance cost-effectively. In this paper we propose an approach that aims to solve the fundamental resource reservation and scheduling problem of configuring the cloud utility to meet SLAs for VoD applications at a modest cost. First, we devise a constraint-based model that describes the relationship among channel placement, user groups\u2019 bandwidth allocation, operating costs and QoS constraints. Second, we present a distributed heuristic algorithm, called DREAM, that solves the model and produces a budget solution that reserves and allocates cloud bandwidth, and determines the channel layout among datacenters. Simulations driven by data traces collected from a commercial VoD system demonstrate that DREAM provides much better access locality and data availability than and comparable streaming quality to state-of-the-art solutions at lower cloud operating costs.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Virginia Commonwealth University"], "authors": ["Yuhong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yuhong", "Hong Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0001:Hong", "Ke Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ke", "Zhijie Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zhijie", "Ping Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ping"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
