By placing interpretability criteria directly into the model, we allow for the model to both optimize parameters related to interpretability and to directly report a global set of distinguishable dimensions to assist with further data exploration and hypothesis generation. MGM extracts distinguishing features on real-world datasets of animal features, recipes ingredients, and disease co-occurrence. It also maintains or improves performance when compared to related approaches. We perform a user study with domain experts to show the MGM's ability to help with dataset exploration.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Been Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Been", "Julie A.
