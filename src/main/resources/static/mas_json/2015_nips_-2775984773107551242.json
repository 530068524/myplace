The price to pay for perfect calibration is that these probabilistic predictors produce imprecise (in practice, almost precise for large data sets) probabilities. When these imprecise probabilities are merged into precise probabilities, the resulting predictors, while losing the theoretical property of perfect calibration, are consistently more accurate than the existing methods in empirical studies.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Royal Holloway, University of London", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "Yandex"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Vladimir Vovk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vovk:Vladimir", "Ivan Petej.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petej:Ivan", "Valentina Fedorova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fedorova:Valentina"], "pages": 9}
