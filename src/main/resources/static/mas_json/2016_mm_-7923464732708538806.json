In this paper, we propose a novel and general hashing framework, which simultaneously considers a new linear pair-wise distance preserving objective and point-wise constraint. The direct distance preserving objective aims to keep the linear relationships between the Euclidean distance and the Hamming distance of data points. Based on different point-wise constraints, we propose two methods to instantiate this framework. The first one is a pseudo-supervised hashing method, which uses existing unsupervised hashing methods to generate binary codes as pseudo-supervised information. The second one is an unsupervised hashing method, in which quantization loss is considered. We validate our framework on two large-scale datasets. The experiments demonstrate that our pseudo-supervised method achieves consistent improvement for the state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods, while our unsupervised method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Texas at San Antonio", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Min Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Min", "Wengang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Wengang", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi", "Zheng-Jun Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Zheng=Jun", "Houqiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Houqiang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
