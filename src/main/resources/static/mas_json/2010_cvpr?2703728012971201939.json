We show that the noise variance in interpolated pixels becomes smaller than that of directly observed pixels without interpolation. Our method capitalizes on the spatial variation of image noise variance in demosaiced images to estimate the color filter array patterns and demosaicing algorithms. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method using various images demosaiced with different demosaicing algorithms extensively.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jun Takamatsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takamatsu:Jun", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki", "Tsukasa Ogasawara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogasawara:Tsukasa", "Katsushi Ikeuchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikeuchi:Katsushi"], "pages": 8}
