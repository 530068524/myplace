At each step the agent must select both which action to use and which parameters to use with that action. We introduce the Q-PAMDP algorithm for learning in these domains, show that it converges to a local optimum, and compare it to direct policy search in the goal-scoring and Platform domains.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of the Witwatersrand", "University of the Witwatersrand", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Warwick Masson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masson:Warwick", "Pravesh Ranchod.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranchod:Pravesh", "George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
