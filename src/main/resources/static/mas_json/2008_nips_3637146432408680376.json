We explore a hybrid model framework for utilizing partially labeled data that integrates a generative topic model for image appearance with discriminative label prediction. We propose three alternative formulations for imposing a spatial smoothness prior on the image labels. Tests of the new models and some baseline approaches on three real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the latent structure.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Xuming He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xuming", "Richard S.
