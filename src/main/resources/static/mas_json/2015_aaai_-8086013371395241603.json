{"title": "Extracting Verb Expressions Implying Negative Opinions.", "fields": ["adjective", "sentiment analysis", "verb", "expression", "adverb"], "abstract": "Identifying aspect-based opinions has been studied extensively in recent years. However, existing work primarily focused on adjective, adverb, and noun expressions. Clearly, verb expressions can imply opinions too. We found that in many domains verb expressions can be even more important to applications because they often describe major issues of products or services. These issues enable brands and businesses to directly improve their products or services. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not received much attention in the literature. In this paper, we make an attempt to solve this problem. Our proposed method first extracts verb expressions from reviews and then employs Markov Networks to model rich linguistic features and long distance relationships to identify negative issue expressions. Since our training data is obtained from titles of reviews whose labels are automatically inferred from review ratings, our approach is applicable to any domain without manual involvement. Experimental results using real-life review datasets show that our approach outperforms strong baselines.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Houston", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Institute for I ... rch, Singapore"], "authors": ["Huayi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Huayi", "Arjun Mukherjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukherjee:Arjun", "Jianfeng Si.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Si:Jianfeng", "Bing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Bing"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
