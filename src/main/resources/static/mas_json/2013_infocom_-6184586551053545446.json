In this paper, we propose a scheme to allow two cars to extract a secret key from RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values in such a way that nearby cars cannot obtain the same secret. Our solution can be executed in noisy, outdoor vehicular environments. We also propose an online parameter learning mechanism to adapt to different channel conditions. We conduct extensive realworld experiments to validate our solution.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "Temple University", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Xiaojun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Xiaojun", "Fengyuan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Fengyuan", "Edmund Novak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novak:Edmund", "Chiu Chiang Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chiu_Chiang", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun", "Guihai Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Guihai"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
