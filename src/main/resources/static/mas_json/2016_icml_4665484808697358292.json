This paper examines discrete distribution estimation under local privacy, a setting wherein service providers can learn the distribution of a categorical statistic of interest without collecting the underlying data. We present new mechanisms, including hashed k-ary Randomized Response (k-RR), that empirically meet or exceed the utility of existing mechanisms at all privacy levels. New theoretical results demonstrate the order-optimality of k-RR and the existing RAPPOR mechanism at different privacy regimes.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Peter Kairouz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kairouz:Peter", "Keith Bonawitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonawitz:Keith", "Daniel Ramage.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramage:Daniel"], "pages": 9}
