This approach begins with a highly abstract agent placement problem and the rapid computation of an initial solution, which is then improved upon using a hill climbing algorithm for a less abstract problem; finally, the solution is fine-tuned within the original problem space. Empirical results demonstrate that this multiabstraction approach significantly outperforms a conventional hill climbing algorithm and an approximate mixed-integer linear programming approach.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Chongjie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chongjie", "Julie A.
