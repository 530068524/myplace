{"title": "On the Satisfiability of Some Simple Probabilistic Logics.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "bounded function", "probabilistic ctl", "boolean satisfiability problem", "decidability"], "abstract": "This paper shows that the satisfiability problems for a bounded fragment of probabilistic CTL (called bounded PCTL) and an extension of the modal \u03bc-calculus with probabilistic quantification over next-modalities (called P\u03bcTL) are decidable. For bounded PCTL we provide an NEXPTIME-algorithm for the satisfiability problem and show that the logic has a small model property where the model size is independent from the probability bounds in the formula. We show that the satisfiability problem of a simple sub-logic of bounded PCTL is PSPACE-complete. We prove that P\u03bcTL has a small model property and that a decision procedure using 2 player parity games can be employed for the satisfiability problem of P\u03bcTL. These results imply that P\u03bcTL and qualitative PCTL formulas with only thresholds >0 and =1---are incomparable. We also establish that---in contrast to PCTL---every satisfiable P\u03bcTL-formula has a rational model, a model with rational probabilities only.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Souymodip Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty:Souymodip", "Joost-Pieter Katoen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katoen:Joost=Pieter"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
