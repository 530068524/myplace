As its foundation, we have designed and implemented a high-quality music engraver, capable of real-time interactive rendering on mobile devices, as well as an intuitive user interface based on multi-touch, both built from scratch using Objective-C and Cocoa Touch. To make  MusicScore  appealing to the general population for their practice and fun, we have introduced a unique auditory capability to  MusicScore , so that it can \"listen\" to and analyze live instrument performance in real time. In order to compensate for the imperfect audio sensing system on mobile devices, we have proposed a collaborative sensing solution to better capture music signals in real time. To maximize the accuracy of live progress tracking and performance evaluation using a mobile device, we have designed a collection of note detection and tempo-based note matching algorithms, using a combination of microphone and accelerometer sensors. Based on our real-world implementation of MusicScore, extensive evaluation results show that  MusicScore  can achieve acceptably low error ratios, even for music pieces performed by highly inexperienced players.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Zimu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zimu", "Yuan Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Yuan", "Baochun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baochun"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
