Another time consuming step is the required individualized adaptation to the BCI user, which involves another 30 minutes calibration for assessing a subject's brain signature. In this paper we aim to also remove this calibration proceedure from BCI setup time by means of machine learning. In particular, we harvest a large database of EEG BCI motor imagination recordings (83 subjects) for constructing a library of subject-specific spatio-temporal filters and derive a subject independent BCI classifier. Our offline results indicate that BCI-native users could start real-time BCI use with no prior calibration at only a very moderate performance loss.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Siamac Fazli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fazli:Siamac", "Cristian Grozea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grozea:Cristian", "M\u00e1rton Dan\u00f3czy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dan=oacute=czy:M=aacute=rton", "Benjamin Blankertz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blankertz:Benjamin", "Florin Popescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popescu:Florin", "Klaus-Robert M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Klaus=Robert"], "pages": 9}
