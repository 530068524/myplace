However, a key challenge is to elicit work that is sufficient and focused where needed. We address this challenge in a geographic open content community, the Cyclopath bicycle route finding system. We devised two techniques to elicit and focus user work, one using familiarity to direct work opportunities and another visually highlighting them. We conducted a field experiment, finding that (a) the techniques succeeded in eliciting user work, (b) the distribution of work across users was highly unequal, and (c) user work benefitted the community (reducing the length of the average computed route by 1 kilometer).", "citation": "Citations (43)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Reid Priedhorsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Priedhorsky:Reid", "Mikhil Masli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masli:Mikhil", "Loren G.
