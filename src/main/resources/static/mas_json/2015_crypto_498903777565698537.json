{"title": "Last Fall Degree, HFE, and Weil Descent Attacks on ECDLP.", "fields": ["field equation", "heuristic", "equation solving", "discrete logarithm", "public key cryptography"], "abstract": "Weil descent methods have recently been applied to attack the Hidden Field Equation (HFE) public key systems and solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) in small characteristic. However the claims of quasi-polynomial time attacks on the HFE systems and the subexponential time algorithm for the ECDLP depend on various heuristic assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "TL@NTU", "I2R"], "authors": ["Ming-Deh A.
