This is the first sub-polynomial approximation algorithm for this problem that runs in near-linear time, improving on the state-of-the-art n (1/3+o(1))  approximation. Previously, approximation of 2 O \u221alog n)  was known only for embedding edit distance into l 1 , and it is not known if that embedding can be computed in less than a quadratic time.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Alexandr Andoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andoni:Alexandr", "Krzysztof Onak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onak:Krzysztof"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
