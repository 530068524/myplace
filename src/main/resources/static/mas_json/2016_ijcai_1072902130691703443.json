{"title": "Conservative Rewritability of Description Logic TBoxes.", "fields": ["rewriting", "inverse", "description logic", "algorithm", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "We investigate the problem of conservative rewritability of a TBox T in a description logic (DL) L into a TBox T\u2032 in a weaker DL L\u2032. We focus on model-conservative rewritability (T\u2032 entails T and all models of T are expandable to models of T\u2032), subsumption-conservative rewritability (T\u2032 entails T and all subsumptions in the signature of T entailed by T\u2032 are entailed by T), and standard DLs between ALC and ALCQI. We give model-theoretic characterizations of conservative rewritability via bisimulations, inverse p-morphisms and generated subinterpretations, and use them to obtain a few rewriting algorithms and complexity results for deciding rewritability.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Liverpool", "University of Bremen", "University of Liverpool", "Birkbeck, University of London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Boris Konev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konev:Boris", "Carsten Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Carsten", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank", "Michael Zakharyaschev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zakharyaschev:Michael"], "pages": 7}
