Our algorithm does not need to store old statistics for all data. The proposed algorithm is much faster than a batch algorithm and is comparable to the batch algorithm in terms of perplexity in experiments.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Google", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Issei Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Issei", "Kenichi Kurihara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurihara:Kenichi", "Hiroshi Nakagawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakagawa:Hiroshi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
