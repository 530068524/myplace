{"title": "Non-elementary complexities for branching VASS, MELL, and extensions.", "fields": ["intermediate logic", "resolution", "modal \u03bc calculus", "zeroth order logic", "propositional variable"], "abstract": "We study the complexity of reachability problems on branching extensions of vector addition systems, which allows us to derive new non-elementary complexity bounds for fragments and variants of propositional linear logic. We show that provability in the multiplicative exponential fragment is Tower-hard already in the affine case---and hence non-elementary. We match this lower bound for the full propositional affine linear logic, proving its Tower-completeness. We also show that provability in propositional contractive linear logic is Ackermann-complete.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Ranko Lazic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazic:Ranko", "Sylvain Schmitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmitz:Sylvain"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
