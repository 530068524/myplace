{"title": "S-gram: towards semantic-aware security auditing for Ethereum smart contracts.", "fields": ["symbolic execution", "program analysis", "solidity", "security token", "database transaction"], "abstract": "Smart contracts, as a promising and powerful application on the Ethereum blockchain, have been growing rapidly in the past few years. Since they are highly vulnerable to different forms of attacks, their security becomes a top priority. However, existing security auditing techniques are either limited in fnding vulnerabilities (rely on pre-defned bug paterns) or very expensive (rely on program analysis), thus are insufcient for Ethereum.     To mitigate these limitations, we proposed a novel semanticaware security auditing technique called S-gram for Ethereum. The key insight is a combination of N-gram language modeling and lightweight static semantic labeling, which can learn statistical regularities of contract tokens and capture high-level semantics as well (e.g., flow sensitivity of a transaction). S-gram can be used to predict potential vulnerabilities by identifying irregular token sequences and optimize existing in-depth analyzers (e.g., symbolic execution engines, fuzzers etc.). We have implemented S-gram for Solidity smart contracts in Ethereum. The evaluation demonstrated the potential of S-gram in identifying possible security issues.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Peking University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Ant Financial, China"], "authors": ["Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Han", "Chao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chao", "Wenqi Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wenqi", "Yu Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0001:Yu", "Jiaguang Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jiaguang"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
