We present a novel probabilistic framework for QPP that gives rise to an important aspect that was not addressed in previous work; namely, the extent to which the query effectively represents the information need for retrieval. Accordingly, we devise a few query-representativeness measures that utilize relevance language models. Experiments show that integrating the most effective measures with state-of-the-art predictors in our framework often yields prediction quality that significantly transcends that of using the predictors alone.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mor Sondak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sondak:Mor", "Anna Shtok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shtok:Anna", "Oren Kurland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurland:Oren"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
