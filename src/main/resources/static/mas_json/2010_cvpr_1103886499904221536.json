This definition differs from previous definitions whose goal is to either identify fixation points or detect the dominant object. In accordance with our saliency definition, we present a detection algorithm which is based on four principles observed in the psychological literature. The benefits of the proposed approach are evaluated in two applications where the context of the dominant objects is just as essential as the objects themselves. In image retargeting, we demonstrate that using our saliency prevents distortions in the important regions. In summarization, we show that our saliency helps to produce compact, appealing, and informative summaries.", "citation": "Citations (1,953)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Stas Goferman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goferman:Stas", "Lihi Zelnik-Manor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zelnik=Manor:Lihi", "Ayellet Tal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tal:Ayellet"], "pages": 8}
