{"title": "Cryptographically Secure Information Flow Control on Key-Value Stores.", "fields": ["information flow", "internet privacy", "cryptography", "cryptographic primitive", "key"], "abstract": "We present Clio, an information flow control (IFC) system that transparently incorporates cryptography to enforce confidentiality and integrity policies on untrusted storage. Clio insulates developers from explicitly manipulating keys and cryptographic primitives by leveraging the policy language of the IFC system to automatically use the appropriate keys and correct cryptographic operations. We prove that Clio is secure with a novel proof technique that is based on a proof style from cryptography together with standard programming languages results. We present a prototype Clio implementation and a case study that demonstrates Clio's practicality.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Chalmers University of Technology", "Harvard University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Lucas Waye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waye:Lucas", "Pablo Buiras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buiras:Pablo", "Owen Arden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arden:Owen", "Alejandro Russo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Russo:Alejandro", "Stephen Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Stephen"], "pages": 15}
