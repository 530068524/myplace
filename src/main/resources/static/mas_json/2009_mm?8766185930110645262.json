{"title": "TAPESTREA: a new way to design sound.", "fields": ["soundscape", "sound design", "workbench", "digital audio", "sonic interaction design"], "abstract": "TAPESTREA is a sound design and composition framework that facilitates the creation of new sound from existing digital audio recordings, through interactive analysis, transformation and re-synthesis. During analysis, sound templates of different types are extracted using a variety of techniques. Each extracted template is transformed and synthesized independently, allowing specialized transformations on each template based on its type. The user interacts with TAPESTREA via a set of graphical interfaces that offer parametric control over every stage of analysis, transformation and re-synthesis. Synthesis is further controlled through ChucK scripts. These combined techniques form a workbench for completely transforming a sound scene, dynamically generating soundscapes, or creating musical tapestries by weaving together transformed elements from different recordings. Thus, TAPESTREA introduces a new paradigm for composition, sound design, and sonic sculpting tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Stanford University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Ananya Misra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Misra:Ananya", "Ge Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Ge", "Perry R.
