{"title": "RECONTEST: Effective Regression Testing of Concurrent Programs.", "fields": ["shared memory", "test case", "regression testing", "backtracking", "software bug"], "abstract": "Concurrent programs proliferate as multi-core technologies advance. The regression testing of concurrent programs often requires running a failing test for weeks before catching a faulty interleaving, due to the myriad of possible interleavings of memory accesses arising from concurrent program executions. As a result, the conventional approach that selects a sub-set of test cases for regression testing without considering interleavings is insufficient In this paper we present R e C on T est  to address the problem by selecting the new interleavings that arise due to code changes. These interleavings must be explored in order to uncover regression bugs. R e C on T est  efficiently selects new interleavings by first identifying shared memory accesses that are affected by the changes, and then exploring only those problematic interleavings that contain at least one of these accesses. We have implemented R e C on T est  as an automated tool and evaluated it using 13 real-world concurrent program subjects. Our results show that R e C on T est  can significantly reduce the regression testing cost without missing any faulty interleavings induced by code changes.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Valerio Terragni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terragni:Valerio", "Shing-Chi Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Shing=Chi", "Charles Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Charles"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
