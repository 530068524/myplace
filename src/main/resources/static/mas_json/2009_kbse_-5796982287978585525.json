The AI search finds the key factors that predict for the success of agile or traditional plan-based software developments. According to our simulations and AI search algorithm: (1) in no case did agile methods perform worse than plan-based approaches; (2) in some cases, agile performed best. Hence, we recommend that the default development practice for organizations be an agile method. The simplicity of this style of analysis begs the question: why is so much time wasted on evidence-less debates on software process when a simple combination of simulation plus automatic search can mature the dialog much faster?", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["West Virginia University", "West Virginia University", "West Virginia University", "West Virginia University", "West Virginia University"], "authors": ["Bryan Lemon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lemon:Bryan", "Aaron Riesbeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riesbeck:Aaron", "Tim Menzies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menzies:Tim", "Justin Price.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Price:Justin", "Joseph D'Alessandro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=Alessandro:Joseph", "Rikard Carlsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carlsson:Rikard", "Tomi Prifiti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prifiti:Tomi", "Fayola Peters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peters:Fayola", "Huihua Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Huihua", "Daniel Port.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Port:Daniel"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
