It becomes more perplexing in multi-agent settings, since the action of an agent may be partially observable to other agents. In this paper, we present a general approach to reasoning about actions and belief change in multi-agent settings. Our approach is based on a multi-agent extension to the situation calculus, augmented by a plausibility relation over situations and another one over actions, which is used to represent agents' different perspectives on actions. When an action is performed, we update the agents' plausibility order on situations by giving priority to the plausibility order on actions, in line with the AGM approach of giving priority to new information. We show that our notion of belief satisfies KD45 properties. As to the special case of belief change of a single agent, we show that our framework satisfies most of the classical AGM, KM, and DP postulates. We also present properties concerning the change of common knowledge and belief of a group of agents.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Liangda Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Liangda", "Yongmei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Yongmei"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
