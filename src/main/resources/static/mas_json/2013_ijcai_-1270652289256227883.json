In this paper, we propose a novel cluster ensemble method from probabilistic perspective. It assumes that each clustering solution is generated from a latent cluster model, under the control of two probabilistic parameters. Thus, the cluster ensemble problem is reformulated into an optimization problem of maximum likelihood. An EM-style algorithm is designed to solve this problem. It can determine the number of clusters automatically. Experimenal results have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods including EAC-AL, CSPA, HGPA, and MCLA. Furthermore, it has been shown that our algorithm is stable in the predicted numbers of clusters.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhipeng Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Zhipeng", "Rui Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Rui", "Zhengheng Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Zhengheng", "Zhenying He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Zhenying", "Weidong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Weidong"], "pages": 7}
