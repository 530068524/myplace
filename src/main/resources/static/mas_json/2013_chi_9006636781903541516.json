In the context of novel interfaces where different modes, available through the environment and context, mediate the interaction, understanding methodological approaches is critical. This paper examines alternative methods of data collection for exploring student's embodied interaction with novel technology in a learning context. Specifically it analyses non-facilitated interaction in a tangible learning environment, in conjunction with three different post activity interview approaches: semi-structured interviews; semi-structured interview with video prompted recall; and interviews using the technology itself. Findings suggest that the different interview approaches change the nature of information elicited, and that non-facilitated interaction offers clearer insight into interpretation, both in terms of the meaning that emerges through, and is, therefore, embodied in the interaction, and in terms of representation, directly informing design.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Institute of Education", "Institute of Education"], "authors": ["Sara Price.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Price:Sara", "Carey Jewitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jewitt:Carey"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
