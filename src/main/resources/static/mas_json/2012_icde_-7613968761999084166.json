{"title": "AutoDict: Automated Dictionary Discovery.", "fields": ["text mining", "hidden markov model", "data modeling", "data model", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "An attribute dictionary is a set of attributes together with a set of common values of each attribute. Such dictionaries are valuable in understanding unstructured or loosely structured textual descriptions of entity collections, such as product catalogs. Dictionaries provide the supervised data for learning product or entity descriptions. In this demonstration, we will present Auto Dict, a system that analyzes input data records, and discovers high quality dictionaries using information theoretic techniques. To the best of our knowledge, Auto Dict is the first end-to-end system for building attribute dictionaries. Our demonstration will showcase the different information analysis and extraction features within Auto Dict, and highlight the process of generating high quality attribute dictionaries.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Fei Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang:Fei", "Periklis Andritsos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andritsos:Periklis", "Erkang Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Erkang", "Ren\u00e9e J.
