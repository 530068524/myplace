{"title": "Blast: Accelerating high-performance data analytics applications by optical multicast.", "fields": ["xcast", "core network", "protocol independent multicast", "pragmatic general multicast", "source specific multicast"], "abstract": "Multicast data dissemination is the performance bottleneck for high-performance data analytics applications in cluster computing, because terabytes of data need to be distributed routinely from a single data source to hundreds of computing servers. The state-of-the-art solutions for delivering these massive data sets all rely on application-layer overlays, which suffer from inherent performance limitations. This paper presents Blast, a system for accelerating data analytics applications by optical multicast. Blast leverages passive optical power splitting to duplicate data at line rate on a physical-layer broadcast medium separate from the packet-switched network core. We implement Blast on a small-scale hardware testbed. Multicast transmission can start 33ms after an application issues the request, resulting in a very small control overhead. We evaluate Blast's performance at the scale of thousands of servers through simulation. Using only a 10Gbps optical uplink per rack, Blast achieves upto 102\u00d7 better performance than the state-of-the-art solutions even when they are used over a non-blocking core network with a 400Gbps uplink per rack.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Yiting Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Yiting", "T.
