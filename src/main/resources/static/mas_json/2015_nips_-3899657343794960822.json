We introduce a new parallel shared-memory recursive best-first AND/OR search algorithm, called SPRBFAOO, that explores the search space in a best-first manner while operating with restricted memory. Our experiments show that SPRBFAOO is often superior to the current state-of-the-art sequential AND/OR search approaches, leading to considerable speed-ups (up to 7-fold with 12 threads), especially on hard problem instances.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Akihiro Kishimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kishimoto:Akihiro", "Radu Marinescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinescu_0002:Radu", "Adi Botea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Botea:Adi"], "pages": 9}
