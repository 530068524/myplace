{"title": "Co-Designing with Preschoolers Using Fictional Inquiry and Comicboarding.", "fields": ["multimedia", "participatory design", "early childhood", "computer science"], "abstract": "In this case study, we describe a design workshop with 7 children age 4-6 using existing co-design techniques known to elicit design insights in older individuals. We found that our 5- and 6-year-old participants successfully generated design ideas using these methods, while 4-year-olds were unable to use create solutions in a traditional format. How-ever, these younger children enthusiastically offered opportunities where, with methodological guidance, the research-er could have followed the child's lead and shifted the design question to one that was potentially more meaningful for the participant. We propose a future work to examine the effectiveness of giving these younger participants great-er authority in defining and scoping the problem space.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alexis Hiniker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hiniker:Alexis", "Kiley Sobel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sobel:Kiley", "Bongshin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Bongshin"], "pages": 6}
