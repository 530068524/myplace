The extended cascading Indian buffet process (eCIBP) essentially consists in adding an extra sampling step to the CIBP to generate connections between nonconsecutive layers. In the context of graphical model structure learning, the proposed approach allows learning structures having an unbounded number of hidden random variables and automatically selecting the model complexity. We evaluated the extended process on multivariate density estimation and structure identification tasks by measuring the structure complexity and predictive performance. The results suggest the extension leads to extracting simpler graphs without scarifying predictive precision.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Laval University", "Laval University", "Laval University"], "authors": ["Patrick Dallaire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dallaire:Patrick", "Philippe Gigu\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gigu=egrave=re:Philippe", "Brahim Chaib-draa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaib=draa:Brahim"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
