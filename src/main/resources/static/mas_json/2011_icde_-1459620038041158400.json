In order to share computation, prior proposals have suggested instantiating certain intermediate aggregates which are then used to generate the final answers for input queries. In this work, we make a number of important contributions aimed at improving the execution and generation of query plans containing intermediate aggregates. These include: (1) a different hashing model, which has low eviction rates, and also allows us to accurately estimate the number of evictions, (2) a comprehensive query execution cost model based on these estimates, (3) an efficient greedy heuristic for constructing good low-cost query plans, (4) provably near-optimal and optimal algorithms for allocating the available memory to aggregates in the query plan when the input data distribution is Zipf-like and Uniform, respectively, and (5) a detailed performance study with real-life IP flow data sets, which show that our multiple aggregates computation techniques consistently outperform the best-known approach.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Google"], "authors": ["K.
