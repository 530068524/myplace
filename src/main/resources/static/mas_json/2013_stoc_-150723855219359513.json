We obtain a communication lower bound of Omega(\u221a(n)/2 k *k) bits, which is essentially optimal. Proving it was a longstanding open problem even in restricted settings, such as one-way classical protocols with k=4 parties (Wigderson 1997). The proof contributes a novel technique for lower bounds on multiparty communication, based on directional derivatives of communication protocols over the reals.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Alexander A.
