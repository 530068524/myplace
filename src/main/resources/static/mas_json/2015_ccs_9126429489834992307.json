We propose a new approach for secure three-party computation (3PC) that improves security while maintaining practical efficiency that is competitive with traditional information-theoretic protocols. Our protocol is based on garbled circuits and provides security against a single, malicious corrupt party. Unlike information-theoretic 3PC protocols, ours uses a constant number of rounds. Our protocol only uses inexpensive symmetric-key cryptography: hash functions, block ciphers, pseudorandom generators (in particular, no oblivious transfers) and has performance that is comparable to that of Yao's (semi-honest) 2PC protocol.   We demonstrate the practicality of our protocol with an implementation based on the JustGarble framework of Bellare et al. (S&P 2013). The implementation incorporates various optimizations including the most recent techniques for efficient circuit garbling. We perform experiments on several benchmarking circuits, in different setups. Our experiments confirm that, despite providing a more demanding security guarantee, our protocol has performance comparable to existing information-theoretic 3PC.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Oregon State University", "Google"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Payman Mohassel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohassel:Payman", "Mike Rosulek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosulek:Mike", "Ye Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ye"], "pages": 12}
