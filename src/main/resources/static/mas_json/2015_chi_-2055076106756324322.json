To achieve this, we introduce a novel Non-linear Spatial Sampling (NSS) technique that significantly cuts down the number of required infrared sensors and emitters. These can be arranged in many different configurations; for example, number of sensor emitter units can be as minimal as one sensor and two emitters. We implemented different configurations of zSense on smart wearables such as smartwatches, smartglasses and smart rings. These configurations naturally fit into the flat or curved surfaces of such devices, providing a wide scope of zSense enabled application scenarios. Our evaluations reported over 94.8% gesture recognition accuracy across all configurations.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Anusha I.
