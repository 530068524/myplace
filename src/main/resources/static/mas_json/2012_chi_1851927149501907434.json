{"title": "Interchangeability of computer and paper based questionnaires in gathering computer experience data from young children.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "computer experiment", "multimedia", "interchangeability", "computer science"], "abstract": "The study compares self-reported computer experience (CE) obtained from children in computer-assisted and paper-and-pencil self-administered questionnaires. Twenty primary school children aged between 8 and 9 years completed a set of CE questions in both forms of administration in a Latin-square order. Findings show that young children can use both methods, and that they are able to answer a computer-based questionnaire just as consistently as a paper-based questionnaire.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Central Lancashire", "University of Central Lancashire"], "authors": ["Akiyo Kano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kano:Akiyo", "Janet C.
