We ran a controlled, between-subjects experiment with 45 participants. We found that the task completion rates were significantly higher with dialed input, particularly for subjects under age 30 and those with less than an eighth grade education. Additionally, participants using dialed input demonstrated a significantly greater performance improvement from the first to final task, and reported less difficulty providing input to the system.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Development Sup ... hmedabad, India"], "authors": ["Neil Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Neil", "Sheetal K.
