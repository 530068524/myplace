In this paper, we go beyond the unsupervised estimation of concept weights, and propose a parameterized concept weighting model. In our model, the weight of each query concept is determined using a parameterized combination of diverse importance features. Unlike the existing supervised ranking methods, our model learns importance weights not only for the explicit query concepts, but also for the latent concepts that are associated with the query through pseudo-relevance feedback. The experimental results on both newswire and web TREC corpora show that our model consistently and significantly outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art retrieval models. In addition, our model significantly reduces the number of latent concepts used for query expansion compared to the non-parameterized pseudo-relevance feedback based models.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Southern California", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Michael Bendersky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bendersky:Michael", "Donald Metzler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Metzler:Donald", "W.
