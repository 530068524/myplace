{"title": "Spatial Processes for Recommender Systems.", "fields": ["recommender system", "machine learning", "data mining", "gaussian", "estimation theory"], "abstract": "Spatial processes are typically used to analyse and predict geographic data. This paper adapts such models to predicting a user's interests (i. e., implicit item ratings) within a recommender system in the museum domain. We present the theoretical framework for a model based on Gaussian spatial processes, and discuss efficient algorithms for parameter estimation. Our model was evaluated with a real-world dataset collected by tracking visitors in a museum, attaining a higher predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art collaborative filters.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Monash University, Clayton campus", "Monash University, Clayton campus", "Monash University, Clayton campus"], "authors": ["Fabian Bohnert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bohnert:Fabian", "Daniel Francis Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Daniel_Francis", "Ingrid Zukerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zukerman:Ingrid"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
