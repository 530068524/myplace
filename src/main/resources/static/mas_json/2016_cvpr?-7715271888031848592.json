{"title": "What Players do with the Ball: A Physically Constrained Interaction Modeling.", "fields": ["trajectory", "computer vision", "basketball", "motion blur", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Tracking the ball is critical for video-based analysis of team sports. However, it is difficult, especially in lowresolution images, due to the small size of the ball, its speed that creates motion blur, and its often being occluded by players. In this paper, we propose a generic and principled approach to modeling the interaction between the ball and the players while also imposing appropriate physical constraints on the ball's trajectory. We show that our approach, formulated in terms of a Mixed Integer Program, is more robust and more accurate than several state-of-the-art approaches on real-life volleyball, basketball, and soccer sequences.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Andrii Maksai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maksai:Andrii", "Xinchao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinchao", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal"], "pages": 10}
