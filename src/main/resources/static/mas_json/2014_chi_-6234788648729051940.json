{"title": "Exploring the usefulness of finger-based 3D gesture menu selection.", "fields": ["gesture recognition", "interaction technique", "finger counting", "gesture", "3d interaction"], "abstract": "Counting using one's fingers is a potentially intuitive way to enumerate a list of items and lends itself naturally to gesture-based menu systems. In this paper, we present the results of the first comprehensive study on Finger-Count menus to investigate its usefulness as a viable option for 3D menu selection tasks. Our study compares 3D gesture-based finger counting (Finger Count menus) with two gesture-based menu selection techniques (Hand-n-Hold, Thumbs-Up), derived from existing motion-controlled video game menu selection strategies, as well as 3D Marking menus. We examined selection time, selection accuracy and user preference for all techniques. We also examined the impact of different spatial layouts for menu items and different menu depths. Our results indicate that Finger-Count menus are significantly faster than the other menu techniques we tested and are the most liked by participants. Additionally, we found that while Finger-Count menus and 3D Marking menus have similar selection accuracy, Finger-Count menus are almost twice as fast compared to 3D Marking menus.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Arun Kulshreshth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulshreshth:Arun", "Joseph J.
