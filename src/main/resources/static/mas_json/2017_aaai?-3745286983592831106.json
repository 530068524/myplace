{"title": "Multiwinner Approval Rules as Apportionment Methods.", "fields": ["proportional representation", "apportionment", "management science", "economics", "public economics", "mathematical economics", "approval voting"], "abstract": "We establish a link between multiwinner elections and apportionment problems by showing how approval-based multiwinner election rules can be interpreted as methods of apportionment. We consider several multiwinner rules and observe that they induce apportionment methods that are well-established in the literature on proportional representation. For instance, we show that Proportional Approval Voting induces the D'Hondt method and that Monroe's rule induces the largest reminder method. We also consider properties of apportionment methods and exhibit multiwinner rules that induce apportionment methods satisfying these properties.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Paris School of Economics", "University of Warsaw", "Technical University of Berlin", "Paris School of Economics", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Markus Brill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brill:Markus", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Laslier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laslier:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois", "Piotr Skowron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skowron:Piotr"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
