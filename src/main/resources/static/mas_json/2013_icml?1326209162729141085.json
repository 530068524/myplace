{"title": "Large-Scale Learning with Less RAM via Randomization.", "fields": ["memory footprint", "randomization", "regret", "randomized rounding", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We reduce the memory footprint of popular large-scale online learning methods by projecting our weight vector onto a coarse discrete set using randomized rounding. Compared to standard 32-bit float encodings, this reduces RAM usage by more than 50% during training and by up to 95% when making predictions from a fixed model, with almost no loss in accuracy. We also show that randomized counting can be used to implement percoordinate learning rates, improving model quality with little additional RAM. We prove these memory-saving methods achieve regret guarantees similar to their exact variants. Empirical evaluation confirms excellent performance, dominating standard approaches across memory versus accuracy tradeoffs.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Daniel Golovin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovin:Daniel", "D.
