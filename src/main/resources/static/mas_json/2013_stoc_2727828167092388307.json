Simple examples show that a similar theorem is impossible in the node-capacitated setting. Nevertheless, we prove that an approximate flow/cut theorem does hold: For some universal $$\\varepsilon > 0$$?>0, if the node cut conditions are satisfied, then one can simultaneously route an $$\\varepsilon $$?-fraction of all the demands. This answers a question of Chekuri and Kawarabayashi. More generally, we show that this holds in the setting of the multi-commodity polymatroid networks introduced by Chekuri et al. (ITCS, pp 399---408, 2012). In their framework, one associates to each node a submodular function on the adjacent edges that dictates the types of flows the node can support. In order to round the convex programs corresponding to node and polymatroid-capacitated flows, we devise a new type of random metric embedding that preserves some of the combinatorial structure of the underlying graph.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Open University of Israel", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Open University of Israel", "University of Washington"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["James R.
