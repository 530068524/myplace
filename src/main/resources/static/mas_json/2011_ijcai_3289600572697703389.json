The existing concept of learning to rank assumes that each training sample is associated with an instance and a reliable label. However, in practice, this assumption does not necessarily hold true. This study focuses on the learning to rank when each training instance is labeled by multiple annotators that may be unreliable. In such a scenario, no accurate labels can be obtained. This study proposes two learning approaches. One is to simply estimate the ground truth first and then to learn a ranking model with it. The second approach is a maximum likelihood learning approach which estimates the ground truth and learns the ranking model iteratively. The two approaches have been tested on both synthetic and real-world data. The results reveal that the maximum likelihood approach outperforms the first approach significantly and is comparable of achieving results with the learning model considering reliable labels. Further more, both the approaches have been applied for ranking the Web visual clutter.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ou Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ou", "Weiming Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Weiming", "Jun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jun"], "pages": 6}
