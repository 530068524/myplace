We gained user-defined gestures that would help with the design and implementation of deformation-based interface, without considering current technical limitations. We found that when a display material gave more freedom from deformation, the level of consensus of gestures among the users as well as the intuitiveness and preferences were all enhanced. This study offers implications for deformation-based interaction which will be helpful for both designers and engineers who are trying to set the direction for future interface and technology development.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Sang-Su Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sang=Su", "Sohyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sohyun", "Bipil Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Bipil", "Eunji Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Eunji", "Boa Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Boa", "Xu Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Xu", "Daeeop Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Daeeop", "Kun-Pyo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kun=Pyo"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
