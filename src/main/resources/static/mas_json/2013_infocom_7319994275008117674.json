When clicking on a Web page, the user expects that the page gets rendered quickly, otherwise be will lose interest and may abort the page load. The causes for a Webpage to load slowly are multiple and not easy to comprehend for an end-user. In this paper, we present FireLog, a plugin for the Firefox Web browser that relies on passive measurements during users' browsing, and helps identify why a web page loads slowly. We present details of our methodology and illustrate it in a case study with real users.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Institut Eur\u00e9com", "Institut Eur\u00e9com"], "authors": ["Heng Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Heng", "Ernst Biersack.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biersack:Ernst"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
