They enable robots to acquire richer functionalities and open the way for the composition of a variety of robotic services with three functions: semantic perception, reasoning and actuation. This paper introduces the recent challenges and future trends of these topics.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Paris Est Cr\u00e9te ... versity, France", "Paris Est Cr\u00e9te ... versity, France", "Paris Est Cr\u00e9te ... versity, France", "ATR Intelligent ... ratories, Japan"], "authors": ["Abdelghani Chibani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chibani:Abdelghani", "Yacine Amirat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amirat:Yacine", "Samer Mohammed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohammed:Samer", "Norihiro Hagita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hagita:Norihiro", "Eric T.
