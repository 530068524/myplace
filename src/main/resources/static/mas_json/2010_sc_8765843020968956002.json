{"title": "Reducing Cache Pollution Through Detection and Elimination of Non-Temporal Memory Accesses.", "fields": ["cache invalidation", "page cache", "bus sniffing", "smart cache", "cache pollution"], "abstract": "Contention for shared cache resources has been recognized as a major bottleneck for multicores--especially for mixed workloads of independent applications. While most modern processors implement instructions to manage caches, these instructions are largely unused due to a lack of understanding of how to best leverage them. This paper introduces a classification of applications into four cache usage categories. We discuss how applications from different categories affect each other's performance indirectly through cache sharing and devise a scheme to optimize such sharing. We also propose a low-overhead method to automatically find the best per-instruction cache management policy. We demonstrate how the indirect cache-sharing effects of mixed workloads can be tamed by automatically altering some instructions to better manage cache resources. Practical experiments demonstrate that our software-only method can improve application performance up to 35% on x86 multicore hardware.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "Uppsala University"], "authors": ["Andreas Sandberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandberg:Andreas", "David Eklov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eklov:David", "Erik Hagersten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hagersten:Erik"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2010", "pages": 11}
