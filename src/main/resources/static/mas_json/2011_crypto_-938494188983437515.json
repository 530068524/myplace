The aim is to use the geographical position of a party as its only credential. On the negative side, we show that if adversaries are allowed to share an arbitrarily large entangled quantum state, the task of secure position-verification is impossible. To this end, we prove the following very general result. Assume that Alice and Bob hold respectively subsystems $A$ and $B$ of a (possibly) unknown quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle \\in {\\cal H}_A \\otimes {\\cal H}_B$. Their goal is to calculate and share a new state $|\\varphi\\rangle = U|\\psi\\rangle$, where $U$ is a fixed unitary operation. The question that we ask is how many rounds of mutual communication are needed. It is easy to achieve such a task using two rounds of classical communication, whereas, in general, it is impossible with no communication at all. Surprisingly, in case Alice and Bob share enough entanglement to start with and we allow an arbitrarily small failure probability,...", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Harry Buhrman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buhrman:Harry", "Nishanth Chandran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandran:Nishanth", "Serge Fehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fehr:Serge", "Ran Gelles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelles:Ran", "Vipul Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Vipul", "Rafail Ostrovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrovsky:Rafail", "Christian Schaffner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaffner:Christian"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2011", "pages": 18}
