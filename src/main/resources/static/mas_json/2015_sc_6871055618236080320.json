{"title": "STS-k: a multilevel sparse triangular solution scheme for NUMA multicores.", "fields": ["memory architecture", "reference implementation", "locality of reference", "sparse matrix", "small number"], "abstract": "We consider techniques to improve the performance of parallel sparse triangular solution on non-uniform memory architecture multicores by extending earlier coloring and level set schemes for single-core multiprocessors. We develop STS-k, where k represents a small number of transformations for latency reduction from increased spatial and temporal locality of data accesses. We propose a graph model of data reuse to inform the development of STS-k and to prove that computing an optimal cost schedule is NP-complete. We observe significant speed-ups with STS-3 on 32-core Intel Westmere-Ex and 24-core AMD `MagnyCours' processors. Incremental gains solely from the 3-level transformations in STS-3 for a fixed ordering, correspond to reductions in execution times by factors of 1.4(Intel) and 1.5(AMD) for level sets and 2(Intel) and 2.2(AMD) for coloring. On average, execution times are reduced by a factor of 6(Intel) and 4(AMD) for STS-3 with coloring compared to a reference implementation using level sets.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Sandia National Laboratories", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "University of Tennessee"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Humayun Kabir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kabir:Humayun", "Joshua Dennis Booth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Booth:Joshua_Dennis", "Guillaume Aupy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aupy:Guillaume", "Anne Benoit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benoit:Anne", "Yves Robert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robert:Yves", "Padma Raghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavan:Padma"], "pages": 11}
