{"title": "iCaRL: Incremental Classifier and Representation Learning.", "fields": ["open problem", "deep learning", "external data representation", "feature learning", "small number"], "abstract": "A major open problem on the road to artificial intelligence is the development of incrementally learning systems that learn about more and more concepts over time from a stream of data. In this work, we introduce a new training strategy, iCaRL, that allows learning in such a class-incremental way: only the training data for a small number of classes has to be present at the same time and new classes can be added progressively. iCaRL learns strong classifiers and a data representation simultaneously. This distinguishes it from earlier works that were fundamentally limited to fixed data representations and therefore incompatible with deep learning architectures. We show by experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 data that iCaRL can learn many classes incrementally over a long period of time where other strategies quickly fail.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rebuffi:Sylvestre=Alvise", "Alexander Kolesnikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolesnikov:Alexander", "Georg Sperl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sperl:Georg", "Christoph H.
