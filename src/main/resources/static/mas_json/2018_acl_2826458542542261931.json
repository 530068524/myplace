{"title": "A Structured Variational Autoencoder for Contextual Morphological Inflection.", "fields": ["open research", "inflection", "autoencoder", "exploit", "generative grammar"], "abstract": "Statistical morphological inflectors are typically trained on fully supervised, type-level data. One remaining open research question is the following: How can we effectively exploit raw, token-level data to improve their performance? To this end, we introduce a novel generative latent-variable model for the semi-supervised learning of inflection generation. To enable posterior inference over the latent variables, we derive an efficient variational inference procedure based on the wake-sleep algorithm. We experiment on 23 languages, using the Universal Dependencies corpora in a simulated low-resource setting, and find improvements of over 10% absolute accuracy in some cases.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University College London", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jason Naradowsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naradowsky:Jason", "Ryan Cotterell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cotterell:Ryan", "Sebastian J.
