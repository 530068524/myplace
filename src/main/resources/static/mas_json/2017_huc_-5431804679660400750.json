In the former, it contributes to the timely detection and treatment of emotional and mental disorders, and in the latter, it enables indigenous interaction and enhanced user experience. We present an inter-domain study for affect recognition on seven different datasets, recorded with six different sensors, three different sensor placements, 211 subjects and nearly 1000 hours of labelled data. The datasets are processed and translated into a common spectro-temporal space. The data represented in the common spectro-temporal space is used to train a deep neural network (DNN) for arousal recognition that benefits from the large amounts of data even when the data are heterogeneous (i.e., different sensors and different datasets). The DNN approach outperforms the classical machine-learning approaches in six out of seven datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Sussex", "Jo\u017eef Stefan In ... ljana, Slovenia", "Jo\u017eef Stefan In ... ljana, Slovenia", "Jo\u017eef Stefan In ... ljana, Slovenia"], "authors": ["Martin Gjoreski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gjoreski:Martin", "Hristijan Gjoreski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gjoreski:Hristijan", "Mitja Lustrek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lustrek:Mitja", "Matjaz Gams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gams:Matjaz"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
