{"title": "Cord input: an intuitive, high-accuracy, multi-degree-of-freedom input method for mobile devices.", "fields": ["mobile interaction", "cord", "input method", "input device", "headphones"], "abstract": "A cord, although simple in form, has many interesting physical affordances that make it powerful as an input device. Not only can a length of cord be grasped in different locations, but also pulled, twisted and bent---four distinct and expressive dimensions that could potentially act in concert. Such an input mechanism could be readily integrated into headphones, backpacks, and clothing. Once grasped in the hand, a cord can be used in an eyes-free manner to control mobile devices, which often feature small screens and cramped buttons. In this note, we describe a proof-of-concept cord-based sensor, which senses three of the four input dimensions we propose. In addition to a discussion of potential uses, we also present results from our preliminary user study. The latter sought to compare the targeting performance and selection accuracy of different cord-based input modalities. We conclude with brief set of design recommendations drawn upon results from our study.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Julia Schwarz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwarz:Julia", "Chris Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Chris", "Scott E.
