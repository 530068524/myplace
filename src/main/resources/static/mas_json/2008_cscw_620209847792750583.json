In this paper, we present evidence of ICT use for re-orientation toward the community and for the production of public goods in the form of information dissemination during disasters. Results from this study of information seeking practices by members of the public during the October 2007 Southern California wildfires suggest that ICT use provides a means for communicating community-relevant information especially when members become geographically dispersed, leveraging and even building community resources in the process. In the presence of pervasive ICT, people are developing new practices for emergency response by using ICT to address problems that arise from information dearth and geographical dispersion. In doing so, they find community by reconnecting with others who share their concern for the locale threatened by the hazard.", "citation": "Citations (317)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Irina Shklovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shklovski:Irina", "Leysia Palen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palen:Leysia", "Jeannette Sutton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sutton:Jeannette"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
