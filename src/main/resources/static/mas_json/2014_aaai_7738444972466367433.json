However, the state-of-the-art methods for this problem suffer from high time complexity--quadratic or cubic in n (the number of data instances). In this paper we exploit a data selection algorithm to speedup computation and the robust principal component analysis to strengthen robustness. Accordingly, we devise a scalable and robust subspace clustering method which costs time only linear in n. We prove theoretically that under certain mild assumptions our method solves the subspace clustering problem exactly even for grossly corrupted data. Our algorithm is based on very simple ideas, yet it is the only linear time algorithm with noiseless or noisy recovery guarantee. Finally, empirical results verify our theoretical analysis.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Shusen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shusen", "Bojun Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Bojun", "Congfu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Congfu", "Zhihua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 8}
