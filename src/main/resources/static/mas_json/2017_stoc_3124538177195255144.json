Unconditional constructions of such functions are known from before (Goldmann et al., IPL \u00e2  94), but these have been canonical functions that have not found further use, while our functions are closely related to well-studied problems and have considerable algebraic structure.   Based on the average-case hardness and structural properties of our functions, we outline the construction of a  Proof of Work  scheme and discuss possible approaches to constructing fine-grained One-Way Functions. We also show how our reductions make conjectures regarding the worst-case hardness of the problems we reduce from (and consequently the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis)  heuristically falsifiable  in a sense similar to that of (Naor, CRYPTO \u00e2  03).   We prove our hardness results in each case by showing fine-grained reductions from solving one of three problems \u00e2   namely, Orthogonal Vectors (OV), 3SUM, and All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) \u00e2   in the worst case to computing our function correctly on a uniformly random input. The conjectured hardness of OV and 3SUM then gives us functions that require  n  2\u00e2   o (1)  time to compute on average, and that of APSP gives us a function that requires  n  3\u00e2   o (1)  time. Using the same techniques we also obtain a conditional average-case time hierarchy of functions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya", "University of California, Berkeley", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Marshall Ball.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ball:Marshall", "Alon Rosen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosen:Alon", "Manuel Sabin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabin:Manuel", "Prashant Nalini Vasudevan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasudevan:Prashant_Nalini"], "pages": 14}
