Within the Medical VR and MxR groups at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, we have been leveraging the technology of the Microsoft Kinect 3D depth-sensing camera. Our Kinect-based rehabilitation game \u201cJewelMine\u201d consists of a set of static balance training exercises which encourage the players to reach out of their base of support. We plan to demonstrate a sophisticated post-session analysis tool and several content themes which can be changed dynamically during a therapy session.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Belinda Lange.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lange:Belinda", "Sebastian Koenig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koenig:Sebastian", "Eric McConnell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McConnell:Eric", "Chien-Yen Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Chien=Yen", "Rick Juang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juang:Rick", "Evan A.
