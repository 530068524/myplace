This inverse maintenance problem is the computational bottleneck in solving multiple optimization problems. We show how to solve this problem with O(nnz(A)+da#x03A9) preprocessing time and amortized O(nnz(A)+d2) time per round, improving upon previous running times. Consequently, we obtain the fastest known running times for solving multiple problems including, linear programming, computing a rounding of a polytope, and sampling a point in a polytope. In particular given a feasible point in a linear program with n variables, d constraints, and constraint matrix A a#x03B5; R{d\u00d7n}, we show how to solve the linear program in time O((nnz(A)+d2)a#x221A;d log(a#x03B5; -- 1)). We achieve our results through a novel combination of classic numerical techniques of low rank update, preconditioning, and fast matrix multiplication as well as recent work on subspace embeddings and spectral sparsification that we hope will be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "Aaron Sidford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sidford:Aaron"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
