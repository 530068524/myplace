While very efficient algorithms already exist for the unweighted case, the calculation of signatures for weighted sets is still a time consuming task. BagMinHash is a new algorithm that can be orders of magnitude faster than current state of the art without any particular restrictions or assumptions on weights or data dimensionality. Applied to the special case of unweighted sets, it represents the first efficient algorithm producing independent signature components. A series of tests finally verifies the new algorithm and also reveals limitations of other approaches published in the recent past.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dynatrace, Linz, Austria"], "authors": ["Otmar Ertl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ertl:Otmar"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
