This is for good reason: usability evaluation has a significant role to play when conditions warrant it. Yet evaluation can be ineffective and even harmful if naively done 'by rule' rather than 'by thought'. If done during early stage design, it can mute creative ideas that do not conform to current interface norms. If done to test radical innovations, the many interface issues that would likely arise from an immature technology can quash what could have been an inspired vision. If done to validate an academic prototype, it may incorrectly suggest a design's scientific worthiness rather than offer a meaningful critique of how it would be adopted and used in everyday practice. If done without regard to how cultures adopt technology over time, then today's reluctant reactions by users will forestall tomorrow's eager acceptance. The choice of evaluation methodology - if any - must arise from and be appropriate for the actual problem or research question under consideration.", "citation": "Citations (498)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Saul Greenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenberg:Saul", "William Buxton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buxton:William"], "pages": 10}
