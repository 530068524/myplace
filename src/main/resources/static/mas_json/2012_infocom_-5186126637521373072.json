K-anonymity is an important measure for privacy to prevent the disclosure of personal data. In this paper, we propose a mechanism based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to partition user locations into groups each containing at least K users (called spatial cloaks). The mechanism is shown to preserve both locality and K-anonymity. We then devise an efficient algorithm to answer kNN queries for any point in the spatial cloaks of arbitrary polygonal shape. Extensive simulation study shows that both algorithms have superior performance with moderate computation complexity.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "departments": ["University of Houston", "University of Houston", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Khuong Vu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vu:Khuong", "Rong Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Rong", "Jie Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jie"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
