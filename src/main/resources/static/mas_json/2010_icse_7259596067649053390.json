{"title": "A degree-of-knowledge model to capture source code familiarity.", "fields": ["codebase", "kpi driven code analysis", "expertise finding", "code review", "internal documentation"], "abstract": "The size and high rate of change of source code comprising a software system make it difficult for software developers to keep up with who on the team knows about particular parts of the code. Existing approaches to this problem are based solely on authorship of code. In this paper, we present data from two professional software development teams to show that both authorship and interaction information about how a developer interacts with the code are important in characterizing a developer's knowledge of code. We introduce the degree-of-knowledge model that computes automatically a real value for each source code element based on both authorship and interaction information. We show that the degree-of-knowledge model can provide better results than an existing expertise finding approach and also report on case studies of the use of the model to support knowledge transfer and to identify changes of interest.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Thomas Fritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fritz:Thomas", "Jingwen Ou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ou:Jingwen", "Gail C.
