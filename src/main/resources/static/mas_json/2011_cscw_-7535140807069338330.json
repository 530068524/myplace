This paper describes research in progress to explore how new forms of collaborative learning in scientific fieldwork can be supported. We describe field trials of a prototype system designed to connect higher education students engaged in earth science fieldwork with peers based in a 'mission control' type environment. We discuss how analysis of these trials is leading us to identify new requirements to support effective collaboration between users based across contrasting locations, including issues of spatial coherence, deictic communication and reflection.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Open University", "Open University", "Open University", "Open University", "Open University"], "authors": ["Tim Coughlan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coughlan:Tim", "Anne Adams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adams:Anne", "Trevor D.
