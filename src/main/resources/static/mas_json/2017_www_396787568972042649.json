{"title": "Who Controls the Internet?: Analyzing Global Threats using Property Graph Traversals.", "fields": ["graph", "great cannon", "root cause", "denial of service attack", "javascript"], "abstract": "The Internet is built on top of intertwined network services, e.g., email, DNS, and content distribution networks operated by private or governmental organizations. Recent events have shown that these organizations may, knowingly or unknowingly, be part of global-scale security incidents including state-sponsored mass surveillance programs and large-scale DDoS attacks. For example, in March 2015 the Great Cannon attack has shown that an Internet service provider can weaponize millions of Web browsers and turn them into DDoS bots by injecting malicious JavaScript code into transiting TCP connections.\n\nWhile attack techniques and root cause vulnerabilities are routinely studied, we still lack models and algorithms to study the intricate dependencies between services and providers, reason on their abuse, and assess the attack impact. To close this gap, we present a technique that models services, providers, and dependencies as a property graph. Moreover, we present a taint-style propagation-based technique to query the model, and present an evaluation of our framework on the top 100k Alexa domains.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "authors": ["Milivoj Simeonovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simeonovski:Milivoj", "Giancarlo Pellegrino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pellegrino:Giancarlo", "Christian Rossow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossow:Christian", "Michael Backes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Backes_0001:Michael"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
