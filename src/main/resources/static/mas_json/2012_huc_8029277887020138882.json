In this paper, we propose a novel method using magnetometer embedded in the mobile phone to recognize activities by detecting household appliance usage. The key idea of our approach is that when the mobile phone user performs a certain activity at home, the embedded magnetometer is capable of capturing the changes of the magnetic field strength around the mobile phone caused by the household appliance in operation. Our mobile application uses these changes as magnetic signatures for each of these appliance such that the daily household acitivities associated with these appliance such as cooking can be recognized.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Mi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Mi", "Alexander A.
