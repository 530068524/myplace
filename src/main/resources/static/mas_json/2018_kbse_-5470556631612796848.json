It leverages the efficient transformation and runtime features of PITest. The demonstration compares Descartes with Gregor, the default mutation engine provided by PITest, in a set of real open source projects. It considers the execution time, number of mutants created and the relationship between the mutation scores produced by both engines. It provides some insights on the main features exposed byDescartes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Oscar Luis Vera-P\u00e9rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vera=P=eacute=rez:Oscar_Luis", "Martin Monperrus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monperrus:Martin", "Benoit Baudry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudry:Benoit"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
