However, it is not always easy to know what to compare and what are the alternatives. In this paper, we present a novel way to automatically mine comparable entities from comparative questions that users posted online to address this difficulty. To ensure high precision and high recall, we develop a weakly supervised bootstrapping approach for comparative question identification and comparable entity extraction by leveraging a large collection of online question archive. The experimental results show our method achieves F1-measure of 82.5 percent in comparative question identification and 83.3 percent in comparable entity extraction. Both significantly outperform an existing state-of-the-art method. Additionally, our ranking results show highly relevance to user's comparison intents in web.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Beihang University", "National University of Defense Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Beihang University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shasha Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shasha", "Chin-Yew Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chin=Yew", "Young-In Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Young=In", "Zhoujun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhoujun"], "pages": 9}
