{"title": "Bespoke tools: adapted to the concepts developers know.", "fields": ["program analysis", "development environment", "computer engineering", "bespoke", "software"], "abstract": "Even though different developers have varying levels of expertise, the tools in one developer's integrated development environment (IDE) behave the same as the tools in every other developers' IDE. In this paper, we propose the idea of automatically customizing development tools by modeling what a developer knows about software concepts. We then sketch three such ``bespoke'' tools and describe how development data can be used to infer what a developer knows about relevant concepts. Finally, we describe our ongoing efforts to make bespoke program analysis tools that customize their notifications to the developer using them.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Brittany Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Brittany", "Rahul Pandita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandita:Rahul", "Emerson R.
