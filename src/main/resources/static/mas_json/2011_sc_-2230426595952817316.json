{"title": "Hadoop acceleration through network levitated merge.", "fields": ["serialization", "merge algorithm", "cpu time", "programming paradigm", "server"], "abstract": "Hadoop is a popular open-source implementation of the MapReduce programming model for cloud computing. However, it faces a number of issues to achieve the best performance from the underlying system. These include a serialization barrier that delays the reduce phase, repetitive merges and disk access, and lack of capability to leverage latest high speed interconnects. We describe Hadoop-A, an acceleration framework that optimizes Hadoop with plugin components implemented in C++ for fast data movement, overcoming its existing limitations. A novel network-levitated merge algorithm is introduced to merge data without repetition and disk access. In addition, a full pipeline is designed to overlap the shuffle, merge and reduce phases. Our experimental results show that Hadoop-A doubles the data processing throughput of Hadoop, and reduces CPU utilization by more than 36%.", "citation": "Citations (141)", "departments": ["Auburn University", "Auburn University", "Auburn University", "Mellanox Technologies", "Mellanox Technologies"], "authors": ["Yandong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yandong", "Xinyu Que.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Que:Xinyu", "Weikuan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Weikuan", "Dror Goldenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldenberg:Dror", "Dhiraj Sehgal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sehgal:Dhiraj"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
