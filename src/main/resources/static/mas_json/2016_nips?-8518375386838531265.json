{"title": "The Sound of APALM Clapping: Faster Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization with Stochastic Asynchronous PALM.", "fields": ["optimization problem", "convergence", "matrix decomposition", "speedup", "asynchronous communication"], "abstract": "We introduce the Stochastic Asynchronous Proximal Alternating Linearized Minimization (SAPALM) method, a block coordinate stochastic proximal-gradient method for solving nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problems. SAPALM is the first asynchronous parallel optimization method that provably converges on a large class of nonconvex, nonsmooth problems. We prove that SAPALM matches the best known rates of convergence --- among synchronous or asynchronous methods --- on this problem class. We provide upper bounds on the number of workers for which we can expect to see a linear speedup, which match the best bounds known for less complex problems, and show that in practice SAPALM achieves this linear speedup. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several matrix factorization problems.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Damek Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Damek", "Brent Edmunds.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edmunds:Brent", "Madeleine Udell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Udell:Madeleine"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
