The existing efforts, despite being numerous, have primarily centered around owner-operated data centers (e.g., Google), leaving another critical data center segment \u2014 colocation data center (e.g., Equinix) which rents out physical space to multiple tenants for housing their own servers \u2014 much less explored. Colocations have a major barrier to achieve cost efficiency: server power management by individual tenants is uncoordinated. This paper proposes RECO (REward for COst reduction), which shifts tenants' power management from uncoordinated to coordinated, using financial reward as a lever. RECO pays (voluntarily participating) tenants for energy reduction such that the colocation operator's overall cost is minimized. RECO incorporates the time-varying operation environment (e.g., cooling efficiency, intermittent renewables), addresses the peak power demand charge, and also proactively learns tenants' unknown responses to the offered reward. RECO includes a new feedback-based online algorithm to optimize the reward without far future offline information. We evaluate RECO using both scaled-down prototype experiments and simulations. Our results show that RECO is \"win-win\" and can successfully reduce the colocation operator's overall cost, by up to 27% compared to the no-incentive baseline case. Further, tenants receive financial rewards (up to 15% of their colocation costs) for \"free\" without violating Service Level Agreements.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Mohammad A.
