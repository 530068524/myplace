{"title": "Coordination Policies for Co-located Collaborative Travel.", "fields": ["collaborative software", "virtual machine", "swap", "collaborative learning", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "To make virtual environment experiences more engaging, we propose to use multiple interaction devices and to support collaborative travel for co-located groups of users. Results of a preliminary pilot study of a collaborative travel task for pairs of users in a projection-based display system suggest that the use of multiple controllers is much more effective and satisfying than swapping and sharing a single device. The study also highlights functional differences between coordination policies for collaborative travel.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["FHNW Academy of ... simon@gmail.com", "FHNW Academy of ... rn@ifi.unizh.ch"], "authors": ["Andreas Simon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simon:Andreas", "Christian Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Christian"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
