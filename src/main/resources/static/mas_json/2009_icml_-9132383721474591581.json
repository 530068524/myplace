{"title": "The graphlet spectrum.", "fields": ["strength of a graph", "simplex graph", "quartic graph", "coxeter graph", "integral graph"], "abstract": "Current graph kernels suffer from two limitations: graph kernels based on counting particular types of subgraphs ignore the relative position of these subgraphs to each other, while graph kernels based on algebraic methods are limited to graphs without node labels. In this paper we present the  graphlet spectrum , a system of graph invariants derived by means of group representation theory that capture information about the number as well as the position of labeled subgraphs in a given graph. In our experimental evaluation the graphlet spectrum outperforms state-of-the-art graph kernels.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Gatsby Computat ...
