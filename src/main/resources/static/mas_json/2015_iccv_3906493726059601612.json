In this paper, we formulate the segmentation of a video sequence based on point trajectories as a minimum cost multicut problem. Unlike the commonly used spectral clustering formulation, the minimum cost multicut formulation gives natural rise to optimize not only for a cluster assignment but also for the number of clusters while allowing for varying cluster sizes. In this setup, we provide a method to create a long-term point trajectory graph with attractive and repulsive binary terms and outperform state-of-the-art methods based on spectral clustering on the FBMS-59 dataset and on the motion subtask of the VSB100 dataset.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "External Organizations"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Margret Keuper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keuper:Margret", "Bjoern Andres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andres:Bjoern", "Thomas Brox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brox:Thomas"], "pages": 9}
