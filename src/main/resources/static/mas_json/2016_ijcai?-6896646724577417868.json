{"title": "Scalable Greedy Algorithms for Task/Resource Constrained Multi-Agent Stochastic Planning.", "fields": ["machine learning", "multi agent planning", "resource allocation", "scalability", "greedy algorithm"], "abstract": "Synergistic interactions between task/resource allocation and stochastic planning exist in many environments such as transportation and logistics, UAV task assignment and disaster rescue. Existing research in exploiting these synergistic interactions between the two problems have either only considered domains where tasks/resources are completely independent of each other or have focussed on approaches with limited scalability. In this paper, we address these two limitations by introducing a generic model for task/resource constrained multi-agent stochastic planning, referred to as TasC-MDPs. We provide two scalable greedy algorithms, one of which provides posterior quality guarantees. Finally, we illustrate the high scalability and solution performance of our approaches in comparison with existing work on two benchmark problems from the literature.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "New Mexico State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Pritee Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Pritee", "Pradeep Varakantham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varakantham:Pradeep", "William Yeoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeoh_0001:William"], "pages": 7}
