The dynamics of community formation is framed as a strategic game called community formation game: Given a social network, each node is selfish and selects communities to join or leave based on her own utility measurement. A community structure can be interpreted as an equilibrium of this game.\n\nWe formulate the agents' utility by the combination of a gain function and a loss function. Each agent can select multiple communities, which naturally captures the concept of \"overlapping communities\". We propose a gain function based on Newman's modularity function and a simple loss function that reflects the intrinsic costs incurred when people join the communities. We conduct extensive experiments under this framework; our results show that our algorithm is effective in identifying overlapping communities, and is often better than other algorithms we evaluated especially when many people belong to multiple communities.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Harvard University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Wei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0013:Wei", "Zhenming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhenming", "Xiaorui Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Xiaorui", "Yajun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Yajun"], "pages": 6}
