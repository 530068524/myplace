To minimize the storage requirement, it is worthwhile to compress such data as much as possible. However, existing algorithms tend to com-press floating-point data relatively poorly. As a remedy, we have developed FPcrush, a tool that automatically synthesizes an optimized compressor for each given input. The synthesized algorithms are lossless and parallelized using OpenMP. This paper describes how FPcrush is able to perform this synthesis in real-time, i.e., even when accounting for the synthesis overhead, it compresses the 16 tested real-world single- and double-precision data files more quickly than parallel bzip2. Decompression is an order of magnitude faster and exceeds the throughput of multi-core implementations of bzip2, gzip, and FPC. On all but two of the tested files, as well as on average, the customized algorithms deliver higher compression ratios than the other three tools.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Texas State University", "Texas State University", "Texas State University", "Texas State University"], "authors": ["Martin Burtscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burtscher:Martin", "Hari Mukka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukka:Hari", "Annie Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Annie", "Farbod Hesaaraki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hesaaraki:Farbod"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
