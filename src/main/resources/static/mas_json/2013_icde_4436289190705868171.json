There are two approaches to identify the best plan: bottom-up and top-down join enumeration. But only the top-down approach allows for branch-and-bound pruning, which can improve compile time by several orders of magnitude while still preserving optimality. For both optimization strategies, efficient enumeration algorithms have been published. However, there are two severe limitations for the top-down approach: The published algorithms can handle only (1) simple (binary) join predicates and (2) inner joins. Since real queries may contain complex join predicates involving more than two relations, and outer joins as well as other non-inner joins, efficient top-down join enumeration cannot be used in practice yet. We develop a novel top-down join enumeration algorithm that overcomes these two limitations. Furthermore, we show that our new algorithm is competitive when compared with the state of the art in bottom-up processing even without playing out its advantage by making use of its branch-and-bound pruning capabilities.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Mannheim", "University of Mannheim"], "authors": ["Pit Fender.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fender:Pit", "Guido Moerkotte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moerkotte:Guido"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
