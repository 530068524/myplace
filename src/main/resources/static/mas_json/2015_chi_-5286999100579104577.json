{"title": "ImmerseBoard: Immersive Telepresence Experience using a Digital Whiteboard.", "fields": ["immersion", "rendering", "whiteboard", "immersive technology", "gesture"], "abstract": "ImmerseBoard is a system for remote collaboration through a digital whiteboard that gives participants a 3D immersive experience, enabled only by an RGBD camera (Microsoft Kinect) mounted on the side of a large touch display. Using 3D processing of the depth images, life-sized rendering, and novel visualizations, ImmerseBoard emulates writing side-by-side on a physical whiteboard, or alternatively on a mirror. User studies involving three tasks show that compared to standard video conferencing with a digital whiteboard, ImmerseBoard provides participants with a quantitatively better ability to estimate their remote partners' eye gaze direction, gesture direction, intention, and level of agreement. Moreover, these quantitative capabilities translate qualitatively into a heightened sense of being together and a more enjoyable experience. ImmerseBoard's form factor is suitable for practical and easy installation in homes and offices.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Keita Higuchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Higuchi:Keita", "Yinpeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yinpeng", "Philip A.
