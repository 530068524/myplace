We observe, however, that the challenge is similar in many respects to that of testing real CPUs. We thus propose to apply the testing environment of CPU vendors to hypervisors. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposal by adapting Intel's testing facility to the Linux KVM hypervisor. We uncover and fix 117 bugs, six of which are security vulnerabilities. We further find four flaws in Intel virtualization technology, causing a disparity between the observable behavior of code running on virtual and bare-metal servers.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Nadav Amit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amit:Nadav", "Dan Tsafrir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsafrir:Dan", "Assaf Schuster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuster:Assaf", "Ahmad Ayoub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ayoub:Ahmad", "Eran Shlomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shlomo:Eran"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2015", "pages": 17}
