We first make a novel analysis of the working mechanism of the diffusion matrix, which reveals the close relationship between saliency diffusion and spectral clustering. Following this analysis, we propose to re-synthesize the diffusion matrix from the most discriminative eigenvectors after adaptive re-weighting. Further, we propose to generate the seed vector based on the readily available diffusion maps, avoiding extra computation for color-based seed search. As a particular instance, we use inverse normalized Laplacian matrix as the original diffusion matrix and promote the corresponding salient object detection algorithm, which leads to superior performance as experimentally demonstrated.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Shandong University", "University of California, San Diego", "Shandong University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Peng Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Peng", "Nuno Vasconcelos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasconcelos:Nuno", "Jingliang Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Jingliang"], "pages": 9}
