{"title": "Beyond QWERTY: augmenting touch screen keyboards with multi-touch gestures for non-alphanumeric input.", "fields": ["alphanumeric", "punctuation", "multimedia", "gesture", "multi touch"], "abstract": "Although many techniques have been proposed to improve text input on touch screens, the vast majority of this research ignores non-alphanumeric input ( i.e. , punctuation, symbols, and modifiers). To support this input, widely adopted commercial touch-screen interfaces require mode switches to alternate keyboard layouts for most punctuation and symbols. Our approach is to  augment  existing ten-finger QWERTY keyboards with multi-touch gestural input that can exist as a complement to the moded-keyboard approach. To inform our design, we conducted a study to elicit user-defined gestures from 20 participants. The final gesture set includes both multi-touch and single-touch gestures for commonly used non-alphanumeric text input. We implemented and conducted a preliminary evaluation of a touch-screen keyboard augmented with this technique. Findings show that using gestures for non-alphanumeric input is no slower than using keys, and that users strongly prefer gestures to a moded-keyboard interface.", "citation": "Citations (119)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Leah Findlater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Findlater:Leah", "Ben Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Ben", "Jacob O.
