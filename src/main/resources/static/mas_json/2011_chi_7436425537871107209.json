{"title": "MoBoogie: creative expression through whole body musical interaction.", "fields": ["mobile interaction", "dance", "information system", "expression", "musical"], "abstract": "In this paper we describe MoBoogie, an application that allows users to manipulate and arrange music through movement. MoBoogie is designed to foster experiences in creative expression for children and potentially adults. The application responds to users' movements by changing variables in a continuous stream of music loops. Results from this study suggest that the creative expressions arose in the joint space of movement and music, and did not primarily have to be in one form or the other. This allowed users with limited experience in dance and music making to be creative in such forms of expression.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Stockholm University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Megan K.
