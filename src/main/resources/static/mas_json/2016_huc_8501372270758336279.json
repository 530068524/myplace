To improve user experience, LBSs often provide personalized recommendations to users by mining their activity (i.e., check-in) data from location-based social networks. However, releasing user check-in data makes users vulnerable to inference attacks, as private data (e.g., gender) can often be inferred from the users' check-in data. In this paper, we propose PrivCheck, a customizable and continuous privacy-preserving check-in data publishing framework providing users with continuous privacy protection against inference attacks. The key idea of PrivCheck is to obfuscate user check-in data such that the privacy leakage of user-specified private data is minimized under a given data distortion budget, which ensures the utility of the obfuscated data to empower personalized LBSs. Since users often give LBS providers access to both their historical check-in data and future check-in streams, we develop two data obfuscation methods for historical and online check-in publishing, respectively. An empirical evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that our framework can efficiently provide effective and continuous protection of user-specified private data, while still preserving the utility of the obfuscated data for personalized LBSs.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Peking University", "University of Rennes", "University of Fribourg", "eUniversity of  ... rg, Switzerland"], "authors": ["Dingqi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Dingqi", "Daqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Daqing", "Bingqing Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Bingqing", "Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cudr=eacute==Mauroux:Philippe"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
