However, it is not always clear what should be the exact nature of such a logic, and how to choose one for a specific application. In this paper, we formulate a list of desirable properties of \"ideal\" logics for reasoning with inconsistency, identify a variety of logics that have these properties, and provide a systematic way of constructing, for every n > 2, a family of such n-valued logics.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "School of Compu ... l-Aviv, Israel"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ofer Arieli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arieli:Ofer", "Arnon Avron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avron:Arnon", "Anna Zamansky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zamansky:Anna"], "pages": 6}
