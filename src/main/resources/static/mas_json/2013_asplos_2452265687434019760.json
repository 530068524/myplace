{"title": "ConAir: featherweight concurrency bug recovery via single-threaded idempotent execution.", "fields": ["correctness", "bebugging", "idempotence", "generality", "static analysis"], "abstract": "Many concurrency bugs are hidden in deployed software and cause severe failures for  end-users . When they finally manifest and become known by  developers , they are difficult to fix correctly. To support end-users, we need techniques that help software survive hidden concurrency bugs during production runs. To help developers, we need techniques that fix exposed concurrency bugs.   The state-of-the-art techniques on concurrency-bug fixing and survival only satisfy a subset of four important properties: compatibility, correctness, generality, and performance.We aim to develop a system that satisfies all of these four properties. To achieve this goal, we leverage two observations: (1) rolling back a  single  thread is sufficient to recover from most concurrency-bug failures; (2) reexecuting an  idempotent  region, which requires no memory-state checkpoint, is sufficient to recover from many concurrency-bug failures. Our system ConAir includes a static analysis component that automatically identifies potential failure sites, a static analysis component that automatically identifies the idempotent code regions around every failure site, and a code-transformation component that inserts rollback-recovery code around the identified idempotent regions.   We evaluated ConAir on 10 real-world concurrency bugs in widely used C/C++ open-source applications. These bugs cover different types of failure symptoms and root causes. Quantitatively, ConAir helps software survive failures caused by all of these bugs with negligible run-time overhead (", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0022:Wei", "Marc de Kruijf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kruijf:Marc_de", "Ang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ang", "Shan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Shan", "Karthikeyan Sankaralingam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankaralingam:Karthikeyan"], "pages": 14}
