Such systems aim to reduce users' cognitive and physical workload, and improve well-being. While the benefits of these systems are clear, recent studies suggest that users may misconstrue their performance of tasks. We see an opportunity in designing interaction techniques that improve how users perceive the performance of such systems. We report two lab studies (N=16 each) designed to investigate whether showing physical motion, which is showing the process of a system through movement (that is intrinsic to the system's task), of an autonomous system as it completes its task, affects how users perceive its performance. To ensure our studies are ecologically valid and to motivate participants to provide thoughtful responses we adopted consensus-oriented financial incentives. Our results suggest that physical presence does yield higher performance ratings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Pedro Garcia Garcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia:Pedro_Garcia", "Enrico Costanza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costanza:Enrico", "Sarvapali D.
