Our framework is based on the theory of random atomic measures, with the prior specified by a gamma process. We derive a posterior characterization and a simple and effective Gibbs sampler for posterior simulation. We develop a time-varying extension of our model, and apply it to the New York Times lists of weekly bestselling books.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Francois Caron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caron:Francois", "Yee Whye Teh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teh:Yee_Whye"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
