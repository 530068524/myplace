{"title": "Bilateral Multi-Perspective Matching for Natural Language Sentences.", "fields": ["sentence", "natural language", "paraphrase", "inference", "encoder"], "abstract": "Natural language sentence matching is a fundamental technology for a variety of tasks. Previous approaches either match sentences from a single direction or only apply single granular (word-by-word or sentence-by-sentence) matching. In this work, we propose a bilateral multi-perspective matching (BiMPM) model under the \"matching-aggregation\" framework. Given two sentences $P$ and $Q$, our model first encodes them with a BiLSTM encoder. Next, we match the two encoded sentences in two directions $P \\rightarrow Q$ and $P \\leftarrow Q$. In each matching direction, each time step of one sentence is matched against all time-steps of the other sentence from multiple perspectives. Then, another BiLSTM layer is utilized to aggregate the matching results into a fix-length matching vector. Finally, based on the matching vector, the decision is made through a fully connected layer. We evaluate our model on three tasks: paraphrase identification, natural language inference and answer sentence selection. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all tasks.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["IBM"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhiguo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhiguo", "Wael Hamza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamza:Wael", "Radu Florian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Florian:Radu"], "pages": 7}
