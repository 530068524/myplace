This report summarizes the answers from a distinguished group of thought leaders representing key software vendors in the data mining industry.   Supporting open standards and the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) in particular, the panel members discuss topics regarding the adoption of prevailing standards, benefits of interoperability for business users, and the practical application of predictive models. We conclude with an assessment of emerging technology trends and the impact that cloud computing will have on applications as well as licensing models for the predictive analytics industry.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["IBM", "KXEN Inc.", "Zementis, San Diego, CA, USA", "Open Data Group ...
