Route redistribution provides a tool, used in many enterprise networks, to either partition a network into multiple routing domains or merge previously independent networks. However, no general technique exists for changing a live network\u2019s route redistribution configuration without incurring packet losses and service disruptions. In this paper, we study the problem of how to safely transition between route redistribution configurations. We investigate what anomalies may occur in the reconfiguration process, showing that many long-lasting forwarding loops can and do occur if naive techniques are applied. We devise new sufficient conditions for anomaly-free reconfigurations, and we leverage them to build provably safe and practical reconfiguration procedures. Our procedures enable seamless network re-organizations to accomplish both short-term objectives, such as local repair or traffic engineering, and long-term requirement changes.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Princeton University", "Roma Tre University", "Naval Postgraduate School", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"], "authors": ["Stefano Vissicchio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vissicchio:Stefano", "Laurent Vanbever.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanbever:Laurent", "Luca Cittadini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cittadini:Luca", "Geoffrey G.
