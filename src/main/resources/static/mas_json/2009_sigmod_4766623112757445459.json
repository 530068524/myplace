Perm  is capable of computing, storing and querying provenance information for the relational data model. Provenance is computed by using query rewriting techniques to annotate tuples with provenance information. Thus, provenance data and provenance computations are represented as relational data and queries and, hence, can be queried, stored and optimized using standard relational database techniques. This demo shows the complete  Perm  system and lets attendants examine in detail the process of query rewriting and provenance retrieval in  Perm , the most complete data provenance system available today. For example,  Perm  supports lazy and eager provenance computation, external provenance and various  contribution  semantics.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Boris Glavic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glavic:Boris", "Gustavo Alonso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alonso:Gustavo"], "pages": 4}
