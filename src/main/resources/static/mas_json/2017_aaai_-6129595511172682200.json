Both latent representations and associations of different modalities are proposed to be jointly learned through an adapted variational auto-encoder. The implementation and results are demonstrated in a robotic handwriting scenario, where the visual sensory input and the arm joint writing motion are learned and coupled. We show the latent representations successfully construct a task manifold for the observed sensor modalities. Moreover, the learned associations can be exploited to directly synthesize arm joint handwriting motion from an image input in an end-to-end manner. The advantages of learning associative latent encodings are further highlighted with the examples of inferring upon incomplete input images. A comparison with alternative methods demonstrates the superiority of the present approach in these challenging tasks.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Lisbon", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Lisbon"], "authors": ["Hang Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Hang", "Francisco S.
