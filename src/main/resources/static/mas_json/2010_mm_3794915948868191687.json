We aim to build rich responsive spaces that sustain the  free improvisation of collectively or individually meaningful non-linguistic gesture . Ozone provides an expressive way to compose the potential \"landscape\" of an event evolving according to the designer's intent as well as contingent activity. A potential-energy engine evolves superposed states over simplicial complexes modeling the topological space of metaphorical states.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Concordia University"], "authors": ["Sha Xin Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Sha_Xin", "Michael Fortin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fortin:Michael", "Navid Navab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navab:Navid", "Timothy Sutton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sutton:Timothy"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
