{"title": "Geometric Deep Learning on Graphs and Manifolds Using Mixture Model CNNs.", "fields": ["deep learning", "mixture model", "convolutional neural network", "shape analysis", "manifold"], "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local, stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph-and 3D shape analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Lugano"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Federico Monti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monti:Federico", "Davide Boscaini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boscaini:Davide", "Jonathan Masci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masci:Jonathan", "Emanuele Rodol\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodol=agrave=:Emanuele", "Jan Svoboda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svoboda:Jan", "Michael M.
