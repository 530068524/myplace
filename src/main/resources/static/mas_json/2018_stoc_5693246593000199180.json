Our main result is an  O ( k  min{1 p ,12} )-distortion embedding. For  p =1, this is a super-exponential improvement over the best previous bound of Lee and Sidiropoulos. Our distortion bound is asymptotically tight for any fixed  p  >1.    Our result is obtained via a novel embedding technique that is based on low depth decompositions of a graph via shortest paths. The core new idea is that given a geodesic shortest path  P , we can probabilistically embed all points into 2 dimensions with respect to  P . For  p >2 our embedding also implies improved distortion on bounded treewidth graphs ( O (( k log n ) 1 p  )). For asymptotically large  p , our results also implies improved distortion on graphs excluding a minor.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["VMware", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ittai Abraham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abraham:Ittai", "Arnold Filtser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filtser:Arnold", "Anupam Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Anupam", "Ofer Neiman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neiman:Ofer"], "pages": 12}
