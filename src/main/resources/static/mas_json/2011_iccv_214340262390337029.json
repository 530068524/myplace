This framework uses a log-Fourier representation of signals/images in which the set of all possible Gaussian blurs of a signal, i.e. its orbits under semigroup action of Gaussian blur functions, is a straight line. Using a set of Riemannian metrics under which the group actions are by isometries, the orbits are compared via distances between orbits. We demonstrate this framework using a number of experimental results involving 1D signals and 2D images.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Zhengwu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhengwu", "Eric Klassen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klassen:Eric", "Anuj Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Anuj", "Pavan K.
