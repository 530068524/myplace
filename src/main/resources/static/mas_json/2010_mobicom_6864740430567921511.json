The design uses a combination of RF and baseband techniques to achieve full-duplexing with minimal effect on link reliability. Experiments on real nodes show the full-duplex prototype achieves median performance that is within 8% of an ideal full-duplexing system.   This paper presents  Antenna Cancellation , a novel technique for self-interference cancellation. In conjunction with existing RF interference cancellation and digital baseband interference cancellation, antenna cancellation achieves the amount of self-interference cancellation required for full-duplex operation.   The paper also discusses potential MAC and network gains with full-duplexing. It suggests ways in which a full-duplex system can solve some important problems with existing wireless systems including hidden terminals, loss of throughput due to congestion, and large end-to-end delays.", "citation": "Citations (1,335)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Jung Il Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jung_Il", "Mayank Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Mayank", "Kannan Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Kannan", "Philip Levis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levis:Philip", "Sachin Katti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katti:Sachin"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
