The input is a set of range measurements that cover large-scale urban environment. The desired output is a set of parse trees, such that each tree represents a semantic decomposition of a building \u2013 the nodes are roof surfaces as well as volumetric parts inferred from the observable surfaces. We model the above problem using a simple and generic grammar and use an efficient dependency parsing algorithm to generate the desired semantic description. We show how to learn the parameters of this simple grammar in order to produce correct parses of complex structures. We are able to apply our model on large point clouds and parse an entire city.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "Stevens Institute of Technology", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Alexander Toshev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toshev:Alexander", "Philippos Mordohai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mordohai:Philippos", "Ben Taskar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taskar:Ben"], "pages": 8}
