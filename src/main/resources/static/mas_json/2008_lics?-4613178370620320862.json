Explicit bounds can be given. Developing a suitable notation system for Bounded Arithmetic, and applying these bounds, all the known results on definable functions of certain such theories can be reobtained in a uniform way.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Swansea University", "Swansea University", "Swansea University", "Swansea University"], "authors": ["Klaus Aehlig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aehlig:Klaus", "Arnold Beckmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beckmann:Arnold"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
