There are important factors to synthesize realistic scenes in 3D CG which are decayed materials such as dead trees, weathered statues, rusty metals and so on. We are interested in the methodology for simulating its decaying processes. In this paper, we propose a simple method for rust aging simulation based on a probabilistic cellular automaton model taking into account object's geometries.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tokyo Denki University", "Tokyo Denki University", "Tokyo Denki University", "Tokyo Healthcar ... y, Tokyo, Japan"], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Katsuhisa Kanazawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanazawa:Katsuhisa", "Ryoma Tanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanabe:Ryoma", "Tomoaki Moriya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moriya:Tomoaki", "Tokiichiro Takahashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takahashi:Tokiichiro"], "pages": 1}
