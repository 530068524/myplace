{"title": "Automatic Entity Recognition and Typing in Massive Text Data.", "fields": ["text corpus", "schema", "ranging", "knowledge extraction", "entity linking"], "abstract": "In today's computerized and information-based society, individuals are constantly presented with vast amounts of text data, ranging from news articles, scientific publications, product reviews, to a wide range of textual information from social media. To extract value from these large, multi-domain pools of text, it is of great importance to gain an understanding of entities and their relationships. In this tutorial, we introduce data-driven methods to recognize typed entities of interest in massive, domain-specific text corpora. These methods can automatically identify token spans as entity mentions in documents and label their fine-grained types (e.g., people, product and food) in a scalable way. Since these methods do not rely on annotated data, predefined typing schema or hand-crafted features, they can be quickly adapted to a new domain, genre and language. We demonstrate on real datasets including various genres (e.g., news articles, discussion forum posts, and tweets), domains (general vs. bio-medical domains) and languages (e.g., English, Chinese, Arabic, and even low-resource languages like Hausa and Yoruba) how these typed entities aid in knowledge discovery and management.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xiang Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiang", "Ahmed El-Kishky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/El=Kishky:Ahmed", "Heng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Heng", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "pages": 5}
