{"title": "Large-scale assessment of mobile notifications.", "fields": ["internet privacy", "multimedia", "mobile phone", "computer science"], "abstract": "Notifications are a core feature of mobile phones. They inform users about a variety of events. Users may take immediate action or ignore them depending on the importance of a notification as well as their current context. The nature of notifications is manifold, applications use them both sparsely and frequently. In this paper we present the first large-scale analysis of mobile notifications with a focus on users' subjective perceptions. We derive a holistic picture of notifications on mobile phones by collecting close to 200 million notifications from more than 40,000 users. Using a data-driven approach, we break down what users like and dislike about notifications. Our results reveal differences in importance of notifications and how users value notifications from messaging apps as well as notifications that include information about people and events. Based on these results we derive a number of findings about the nature of notifications and guidelines to effectively use them.", "citation": "Citations (187)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "Telef\u00f3nica", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alireza Sahami Shirazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shirazi:Alireza_Sahami", "Niels Henze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henze:Niels", "Tilman Dingler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dingler:Tilman", "Martin Pielot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pielot:Martin", "Dominik Weber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weber:Dominik", "Albrecht Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt_0001:Albrecht"], "pages": 10}
