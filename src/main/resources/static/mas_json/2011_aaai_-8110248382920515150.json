Unfortunately, most of the existing solution approaches do not model two key uncertainties of the real-world: there may be noise in the defender's execution of the suggested mixed strategy and/or the observations made by an attacker can be noisy. In this paper, we provide a framework to model these uncertainties, and demonstrate that previous strategies perform poorly in such uncertain settings. We also provide RECON, a novel algorithm that computes strategies for the defender that are robust to such uncertainties, and provide heuristics that further improve RE-CON's efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Computer Scienc ... os Angeles, CA", "Computer Scienc ... os Angeles, CA", "Computer Scienc ... os Angeles, CA"], "authors": ["Zhengyu Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Zhengyu", "Manish Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Manish", "Milind Tambe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tambe:Milind", "Fernando Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ord=oacute==ntilde=ez:Fernando"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
