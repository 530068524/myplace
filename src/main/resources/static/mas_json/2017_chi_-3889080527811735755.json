{"title": "All about Acceptability?: Identifying Factors for the Adoption of Data Glasses.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "augmented reality", "computer science", "usability"], "abstract": "Innovations often trigger objections before becoming widely accepted. This paper assesses whether a familiarisation over time can be expected for data glasses, too. While user attitudes towards those devices have been reported to be prevalently negative [14], it is still unclear, to what extent this initial, negative user attitude might impede adoption. However, indepth understanding is crucial for reducing barriers early in order to gain access to potential benefits from the technology. With this paper we contribute to a better understanding of factors affecting data glasses adoption, as well as current trends and opinions. Our multiple-year case study (N=118) shows, against expectations, no significant change towards a more positive attitude between 2014 and 2016. We complement these findings with an expert survey (N=51) investigating prognoses, challenges and discussing the relevance of social acceptability. We elicit and contrast a controversial spectrum of expert opinions, and assess whether initial objections can be overwritten. Our analysis shows that while social acceptability is considered relevant for the time being, utility and usability are more valued for long-term adoption.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Oldenburg", "University of Oldenburg", "OFFIS", "OFFIS", "University of Oldenburg"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Marion Koelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koelle:Marion", "Abdallah El Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Abdallah_El", "Vanessa Cobus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cobus:Vanessa", "Wilko Heuten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heuten:Wilko", "Susanne C.
