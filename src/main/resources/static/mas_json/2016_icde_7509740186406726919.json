In this paper, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet Process Multinomial Mixture model for text clustering (abbr. to GSDPMM) which does not need to specify the number of clusters in advance and can cope with the high-dimensional problem of text clustering. Our extensive experimental study shows that GSDPMM can achieve significantly better performance than three other clustering methods and can achieve high consistency on both long and short text datasets. We found that GSDPMM has low time and space complexity and can scale well with huge text datasets. We also propose some novel and effective methods to detect the outliers in the dataset and obtain the representative words of each cluster.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jianhua Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Jianhua", "Jianyong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jianyong"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
