{"title": "Decaf: Eliminating Cofactors Through Point Compression.", "fields": ["random oracle", "prime", "covert channel", "elliptic curve", "compression"], "abstract": "We propose a new unied point compression format for Ed- wards, Twisted Edwards and Montgomery curves over large-characteristic elds, which eectively divides the curve's cofactor by 4 at very little cost to performance. This allows cofactor-4 curves to eciently implement prime-order groups.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Cryptography Research"], "authors": ["Mike Hamburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamburg:Mike"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 19}
