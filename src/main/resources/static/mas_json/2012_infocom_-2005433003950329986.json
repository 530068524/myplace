This paper introduces the notion of wireless MAC processors. Instead of implementing a specific MAC protocol stack, Wireless MAC processors do support a set of Medium Access Control \u201ccommands\u201d which can be run-time composed (programmed) through software-defined state machines, thus providing the desired MAC protocol operation. We clearly distinguish from related work in this area as, unlike other works which rely on dedicated DSPs or programmable hardware platforms, we experimentally prove the feasibility of the wireless MAC processor concept over ultra-cheap commodity WLAN hardware cards. Specifically, we reflash the firmware of the commercial Broadcom AirForce54G off-the-shelf chipset, replacing its 802.11 WLAN MAC protocol implementation with our proposed extended state machine execution engine. We prove the flexibility of the proposed approach through three use-case implementation examples.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "departments": ["University of Palermo", "University of Palermo", "University of Palermo", "University of Palermo", "CNIT / Universi ...
