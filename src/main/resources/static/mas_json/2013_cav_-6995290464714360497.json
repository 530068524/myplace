The starting point is to fix the alphabet: the set of statements of the given program. We show how automata over the alphabet of statements can help to decompose the main problem in software model checking, which is to find the right abstraction of a program for a given correctness property.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Matthias Heizmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heizmann:Matthias", "Jochen Hoenicke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoenicke:Jochen", "Andreas Podelski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podelski:Andreas"], "pages": 17}
