Our framework is inspired by recent work that uses nonlocal means filtering to regularize depth maps in order to maintain fine detail and structure. Our framework extends this regularization with an additional edge weighting scheme based on several image features based on the additional high-resolution RGB input. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method outperforms existing approaches for 3D-ToF upsampling. We describe the complete process for this system, including device calibration, scene warping for input alignment, and even how the results can be further processed using simple user markup.", "citation": "Citations (367)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "National University of Singapore", "KAIST"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jaesik Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jaesik", "Hyeongwoo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyeongwoo", "Yu-Wing Tai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tai:Yu=Wing", "Michael S.
