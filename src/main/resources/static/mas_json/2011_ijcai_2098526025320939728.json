Our reformulations have the property that unit-propagation in the ASP solver achieves well defined local consistency properties like arc, bound and range consistency. Experiments demonstrate the computational value of this approach.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Christian Drescher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drescher:Christian", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "pages": 6}
