A key feature of this approach is that grammar induction is driven by the extended domain of locality principle of TAG (Tree Adjoining Grammar); and that it takes into account both syntactic and semantic information. The resulting extracted TAG includes a unification based semantics and can be used by an existing surface realiser to generate sentences from KB data. Experimental evaluation on the KBGen data shows that our model outperforms a data-driven generate-and-rank approach based on an automatically induced probabilistic grammar; and is comparable with a handcrafted symbolic approach.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Laboratoire Lor ... es Applications", "Laboratoire Lor ... es Applications"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Bikash Gyawali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gyawali:Bikash", "Claire Gardent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gardent:Claire"], "pages": 11}
