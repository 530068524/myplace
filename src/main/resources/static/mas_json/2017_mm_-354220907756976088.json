{"title": "A Novel System for Visual Navigation of Educational Videos Using Multimodal Cues.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "interactive visualization", "the internet", "navigation system", "distance education"], "abstract": "With recent developments and advances in distance learning and MOOCs, the amount of open educational videos on the Internet has grown dramatically in the past decade. However, most of these videos are lengthy and lack of high-quality indexing and annotations, which triggers an urgent demand for efficient and effective tools that facilitate video content navigation and exploration. In this paper, we propose a novel visual navigation system for exploring open educational videos. The system tightly integrates multimodal cues obtained from the visual, audio and textual channels of the video and presents them with a series of interactive visualization components. With the help of this system, users can explore the video content using multiple levels of details to identify content of interest with ease. Extensive experiments and comparisons against previous studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Guilin University of Electronic Technology", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Baoquan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Baoquan", "Shujin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shujin", "Xiaonan Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Xiaonan", "Songhua Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Songhua", "Ruomei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ruomei"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
