{"title": "A Discriminative Graph-Based Parser for the Abstract Meaning Representation.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "general frame", "formalism", "rotation formalisms in three dimensions", "structured prediction"], "abstract": "Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism for which a grow- ing set of annotated examples is avail- able. We introduce the first approach to parse sentences into this representa- tion, providing a strong baseline for fu- ture improvement. The method is based on a novel algorithm for finding a maxi- mum spanning, connected subgraph, em- bedded within a Lagrangian relaxation of an optimization problem that imposes lin- guistically inspired constraints. Our ap- proach is described in the general frame- work of structured prediction, allowing fu- ture incorporation of additional features and constraints, and may extend to other formalisms as well.
