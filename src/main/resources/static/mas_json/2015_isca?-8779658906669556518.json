{"title": "LaZy superscalar.", "fields": ["commit", "microarchitecture", "spec", "superscalar", "schedule"], "abstract": "LaZy Superscalar is a processor architecture which delays the execution of fetched instructions until their results are needed by other instructions. This approach eliminates dead instructions and provides the necessary means to fuse dependent instructions across multiple control dependencies by explicitly tracking control and data dependencies through a matrix based scheduler. We present this novel redesign of scheduling, recovery and commit mechanisms and evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture. Our simulations using Spec 2006 benchmark suite indicate that LaZy Superscalar can achieve significant speed-ups while providing respectable power savings compared to a conventional superscalar processor.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Michigan Technological University", "Michigan Technological University", "Michigan Technological University", "Michigan Technological University", "Michigan Technological University"], "authors": ["G\u00f6rkem Asilioglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asilioglu:G=ouml=rkem", "Zhaoxiang Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Zhaoxiang", "Murat K\u00f6ksal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=ksal:Murat", "Omkar Javeri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Javeri:Omkar", "Soner \u00d6nder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ouml=nder:Soner"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
