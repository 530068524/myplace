{"title": "An event-based model for interactive live TV shows.", "fields": ["synchronization", "interactive television", "drawback", "hypermedia", "object oriented programming"], "abstract": "Over the years some models for multimedia spatio-temporal synchronization has been proposed. In most of these models, a known drawback is that they generally abstract the media content and consider only start and end events content presentation. Thus, it is not possible to specify synchronization relations involving \"within\" media content events. Highlights in a live TV show are examples of these events. In such cases, it may be expected that highlights \"may occur\", but it is not possible to determine \"when\". In order to solve this drawback, this article presents an approach for modeling live Interactive TV shows that support the definition of synchronization constraints related to events not known at authoring time. These events are structured in objects, using an object oriented paradigm, and broadcasted to TV receivers as way to assure the synchronization relations", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Salvador Univer ... alvador, Brazil", "Salvador Univer ... alvador, Brazil"], "authors": ["Manoel Carvalho Marques Neto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neto:Manoel_Carvalho_Marques", "Celso A.
