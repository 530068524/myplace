Understanding how and why rumors spread in these contexts could assist in the design of systems that facilitate timely and accurate sensemaking. We address a basic question in this line: To what extent does rumor evolution occur (1) through reliance on a centralized information source, (2) in parallel information silos, or (3) through a web of complex informational interactions? We develop a conceptual model and associated analysis algorithms that allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. We analyze a case of rumoring on Twitter during the Boston Marathon Bombing. We find that rumor spreading was predominantly a parallel process in this case, which is consistent with a hypothesis that information silos may underlie the persistence of false rumors. Special attention towards detecting and resolving parallel information threads during collective sensemaking may hence be warranted.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Masschusetts In ... bridge, MA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Peter Krafft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krafft:Peter", "Kaitlyn Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Kaitlyn", "Isabelle Edwards.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edwards:Isabelle", "Kate Starbird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starbird:Kate", "Emma S.
