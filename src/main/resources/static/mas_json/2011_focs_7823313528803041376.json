Krivine proved in 1977 that $K_G\\leq \\pi / (2\\log(1+\\sqrt{2}))$ and conjectured that his estimate is sharp. We obtain a sharper Grothendieck inequality, showing that $K_G 0$. Our main contribution is conceptual: despite dealing with a binary rounding problem, random 2-dimensional projections combined with a careful partition of $R^2$ in order to round the projected vectors, beat the random hyper plane technique, contrary to Krivine's long-standing conjecture.", "citation": "Citations (39)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "IBM", "Toyota", "New York University", "Princeton University", "Microsoft", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "New York University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Mark Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Mark", "Konstantin Makarychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makarychev:Konstantin", "Yury Makarychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makarychev:Yury", "Assaf Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Assaf"], "pages": 10}
