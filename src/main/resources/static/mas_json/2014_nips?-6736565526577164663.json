{"title": "New Rules for Domain Independent Lifted MAP Inference.", "fields": ["equivalence class", "tautology", "probabilistic logic", "truth value", "inference"], "abstract": "Lifted inference algorithms for probabilistic first-order logic frameworks such as Markov logic networks (MLNs) have received significant attention in recent years. These algorithms use so called lifting rules to identify symmetries in the first-order representation and reduce the inference problem over a large probabilistic model to an inference problem over a much smaller model. In this paper, we present two new lifting rules, which enable fast MAP inference in a large class of MLNs. Our first rule uses the concept of single occurrence equivalence class of logical variables, which we define in the paper. The rule states that the MAP assignment over an MLN can be recovered from a much smaller MLN, in which each logical variable in each single occurrence equivalence class is replaced by a constant (i.e., an object in the domain of the variable). Our second rule states that we can safely remove a subset of formulas from the MLN if all equivalence classes of variables in the remaining MLN are single occurrence and all formulas in the subset are tautology (i.e., evaluate to true) at extremes (i.e., assignments with identical truth value for groundings of a predicate). We prove that our two new rules are sound and demonstrate via a detailed experimental evaluation that our approach is superior in terms of scalability and MAP solution quality to the state of the art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "Dept. of Comp.  ... w Delhi, India", "Dept. of Comp.  ... w Delhi, India", "Dept. of Comp.  ... w Delhi, India"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Happy Mittal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mittal:Happy", "Prasoon Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Prasoon", "Vibhav Gogate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gogate:Vibhav", "Parag Singla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singla:Parag"], "pages": 9}
