Therefore, it has been proposed that the idea of Garment Transfer for transfer-ring clothing model from one character to another character [Brouet et al. 2012]. In recent years, this idea has been extended to be applicable between characters in various poses and shapes [Narita et al. 2014]. However, texture design of clothing is not preserved in their method since they deform the source clothing model to fit the target body (see Figure 1(a)(c)).", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Waseda University", "Waseda University", "Waseda University", "Waseda University", "Waseda University"], "authors": ["Fumiya Narita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narita:Fumiya", "Shunsuke Saito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saito:Shunsuke", "Takuya Kato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kato:Takuya", "Tsukasa Fukusato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukusato:Tsukasa", "Shigeo Morishima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morishima:Shigeo"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
