Using an experimental task called Shape Factory, groups of eight participants were configured such that in the baseline 'strangers' condition only the location-based faultline was present while in the experimental 'intergroup' condition, participants from two different shared identity groups engaged in distributed collaboration, creating an additional, cross-cutting faultline. The results showed that participants in the intergroup condition, with both location-based and shared identity faultlines, performed at a higher level than participants in the strangers condition, with only the location-based faultline. In the intergroup condition, the performance effects of location and shared identity were roughly equal and did not affect each other differentially in combination.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Johns Hopkins University", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Amy Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Amy", "Nathan Bos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bos:Nathan", "Judith S.
