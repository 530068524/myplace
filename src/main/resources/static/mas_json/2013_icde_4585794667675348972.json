To reduce the communication frequency of the application server, a promising technique is to apply safe regions, which capture the validity of query results with respect to the users' locations. Unfortunately, the safe regions in our problem exhibit characteristics such as irregular shapes and dependency among multiple safe regions. These unique characteristics render existing safe region methods that focus on a single safe region inapplicable to our problem. To tackle these challenges, we first examine the shapes of safe regions in our problem context and propose feasible approximations for them. We design efficient algorithms for computing these safe regions, as well as develop compression techniques for representing safe regions in a compact manner. Experiments with both real and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of our proposal in terms of computation and communication costs.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "University of Hong Kong", "Dept. of Comput ... ong Kong, China"], "authors": ["Jing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jing", "Man Lung Yiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yiu:Man_Lung", "Nikos Mamoulis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mamoulis:Nikos"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
