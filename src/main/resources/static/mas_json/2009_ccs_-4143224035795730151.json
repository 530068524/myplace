These permissions could be attributes, roles, or rights that the user needs to have in order to access the record. Our protocol offers maximal security guarantees for both the database and the user, namely (1) only authorized users can access the record; (2) the database provider does not learn which record the user accesses; and (3) the database provider does not learn which attributes or roles the user has when she accesses the database.   We prove our protocol secure in the standard model (i.e., without random oracles) under the bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent and the strong Diffie-Hellman assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (190)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "Moscow Engineer ... w, Russian Fed."], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Jan Camenisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camenisch:Jan", "Maria Dubovitskaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dubovitskaya:Maria", "Gregory Neven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neven:Gregory"], "pages": 10}
