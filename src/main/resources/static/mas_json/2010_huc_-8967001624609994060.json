{"title": "Understanding conflict between landlords and tenants: implications for energy sensing and feedback.", "fields": ["renting", "ubiquitous computing", "open research", "autonomy", "landlord"], "abstract": "Energy use in the home is a topic of increasing interest and concern, and one on which technology can have a significant impact. However, existing work typically focuses on moderately affluent homeowners who have relative autonomy with respect to their home, or does not address socio-economic status, class, and other related issues. For the 30% of the U.S. population who rent their homes, many key decisions regarding energy use must be negotiated with a landlord. Because energy use impacts the bottom line of both landlords and tenants, this can be a source of conflict in the landlord/tenant relationship. Ubicomp technologies for reducing energy use in rental units must engage with landlord/tenant conflicts to be successful. Unfortunately, little detailed knowledge is available about the impact of landlord/tenant conflicts on energy use. We present an analysis of a series of qualitative studies with landlords and tenants. We argue that a consideration of multiple stakeholders, and the power imbalances among them, will drive important new research questions and lead to more widely applicable solutions. The main contribution of our work is a set of open research questions and design recommendations for technologies that may affect and be affected by the conflict between stakeholders around energy use.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Tawanna Dillahunt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillahunt:Tawanna", "Jennifer Mankoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mankoff:Jennifer", "Eric Paulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paulos:Eric"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
