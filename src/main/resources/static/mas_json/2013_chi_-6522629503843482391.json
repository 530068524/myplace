We describe our experience using Twitter as a tool for student \"co-construction\" of lecture materials. Students were required to post a tweet prior to each lecture related to that day's topic, and these tweets -- consisting of questions, examples and reflections -- were incorporated into the lecture slides and notes. Students reported that they found lectures including their tweets in the class slides to be engaging, interactive and relevant, and nearly 90% of them recommended we use our co-construction approach again.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Cornell University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Jeremy P.
