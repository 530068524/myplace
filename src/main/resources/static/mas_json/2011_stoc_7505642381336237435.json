In contrast, ignoring incentives there exist constant ratio approximation algorithms for this problem. Our approach is based on a novel  direct hardness  technique that completely skips the notoriously hard step of characterizing truthful mechanisms. The characterization step was the main obstacle for proving impossibility results in algorithmic mechanism design so far. We demonstrate two additional applications of our new technique: (1) an impossibility result for universally-truthful polynomial time flexible combinatorial public projects and (2) an impossibility result for truthful-in-expectation mechanisms for exact combinatorial public projects. The latter is the first result that bounds the power of polynomial-time truthful in expectation mechanisms in any setting.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Cornell University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shahar Dobzinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobzinski:Shahar"], "pages": 10}
