In this paper, we propose a system named SheepDog to automatically add photos into appropriate groups and recommend suitable tags for users on Flickr. We adopt concept detection to predict relevant concepts of a photo and probe into the issue about training data collection for concept classification. From the perspective of gathering training data by web searching, we introduce two mechanisms and investigate their performances of concept detection. Based on some existing information from Flickr, a ranking-based method is applied not only to obtain reliable training data, but also to provide reasonable group/tag recommendations for input photos. We evaluate this system with a rich set of photos and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.", "citation": "Citations (121)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Hong-Ming Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hong=Ming", "Ming-Hsiu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Ming=Hsiu", "Ping-Chieh Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Ping=Chieh", "Min-Chun Tien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tien:Min=Chun", "Winston H.
