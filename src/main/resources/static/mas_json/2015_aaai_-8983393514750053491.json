{"title": "A Complexity Approach for Core-Selecting Exchange with Multiple Indivisible Goods under Lexicographic Preferences.", "fields": ["lexicographic preferences", "mechanism design", "lexicographical order", "payment", "social choice theory"], "abstract": "Core-selection is a crucial property of social choice functions, or rules, in social choice literature. It is also desirable to address the incentive of agents to cheat by misreporting their preferences. This paper investigates an exchange problem where each agent may have multiple indivisible goods, agents' preferences over sets of goods are assumed to be lexicographic, and side payments are not allowed. We propose an exchange rule called augmented top-trading-cycles (ATTC) procedure based on the original TTC procedure. We first show that the ATTC procedure is core-selecting. We then show that finding a beneficial misreport under the ATTC procedure is NP-hard. Under the ATTC procedure, we finally clarify the relationship between preference misre-port and splitting, which is a different type of manipulation.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Kyushu University", "Paris Dauphine University", "Kyushu University", "Kyushu University", "Kyushu University"], "authors": ["Etsushi Fujita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujita:Etsushi", "Julien Lesca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lesca:Julien", "Akihisa Sonoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sonoda:Akihisa", "Taiki Todo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Todo:Taiki", "Makoto Yokoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yokoo:Makoto"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
