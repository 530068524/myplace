{"title": "Causal Termination of Multi-threaded Programs.", "fields": ["graph rewriting", "modular design", "termination analysis", "thread", "contradiction"], "abstract": "We present a new model checking procedure for the termination analysis of multi-threaded programs. Current termination provers scale badly in the number of threads; our new approach easily handles 100 threads on multi-threaded benchmarks like Producer-Consumer. In our procedure, we characterize the existence of non-terminating executions as Mazurkiewicz-style concurrent traces and apply causality-based transformation rules to refine them until a contradiction can be shown. The termination proof is organized into a tableau, where the case splits represent a novel type of modular reasoning according to different causal explanations of a hypothetical error. We report on experimental results obtained with a tool implementation of the new procedure, called Arctor, on previously intractable multi-threaded benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Andrey Kupriyanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kupriyanov:Andrey", "Bernd Finkbeiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finkbeiner:Bernd"], "pages": 17}
