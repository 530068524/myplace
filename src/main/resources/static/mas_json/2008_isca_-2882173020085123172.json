{"title": "Understanding and Designing New Server Architectures for Emerging Warehouse-Computing Environments.", "fields": ["warehouse", "suite", "benchmark", "web server", "server"], "abstract": "This paper seeks to understand and design next-generation servers for emerging \"warehouse-computing\" environments. We make two key contributions. First, we put together a detailed evaluation infrastructure including a new benchmark suite for warehouse-computing workloads, and detailed performance, cost, and power models, to quantitatively characterize bottlenecks. Second, we study a new solution that incorporates volume non-server-class components in novel packaging solutions, with memory sharing and flash-based disk caching. Our results show that this approach has promise, with a 2X improvement on average in performance-per-dollar for our benchmark suite.", "citation": "Citations (243)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Electrical Engi ... and Engineering"], "authors": ["Kevin T.
