A great deal of effort has been made in recent years to develop video encryption methods. However, few studies focus on visual security evaluation, which has significant impact in measuring the effectiveness of these methods. In this paper, a new metric for video encryption is proposed, which evaluates visual security based on color and edge features of original and cipher-videos. The metric is easy to be incorporated into video encryption system for visual security based encryption decision. In addition, subjective tests for visual security assessment have been fully carried out. Experiments show that the proposed metric had better correlation with subjective results than others.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Lingling Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Lingling", "Feng Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Feng", "Yongdong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yongdong", "Jintao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jintao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
