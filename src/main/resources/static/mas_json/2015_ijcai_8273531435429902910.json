{"title": "AGM Revision of Beliefs about Action and Time.", "fields": ["belief revision", "expression", "artificial intelligence", "mathematics"], "abstract": "The AGM theory of belief revision is based on propositional belief sets. In this paper we develop a logic for revision of temporal belief bases, containing expressions about temporal propositions (tomorrow it will rain), possibility (it may rain tomorrow), actions (the robot enters the room) and pre- and post-conditions of these actions. We prove the Katsuno-Mendelzon and the Darwiche-Pearl representation theorems by restricting the logic to formulas representing beliefs up to certain time. We illustrate our belief change model through several examples.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "Utrecht University", "University of Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Marc van Zee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zee:Marc_van", "Dragan Doder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doder:Dragan", "Mehdi Dastani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dastani:Mehdi", "Leendert W.
