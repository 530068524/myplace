Studying members of such developer profile aggregators, we found an ecosystem that revolves around the  social programmer . Developers are assessing each other to evaluate whether other developers are interesting, worth following, or worth collaborating with. They are self-conscious about being assessed, and thus manage their public images. They value passion for software development, new technologies, and learning. Some recruiters participate in the ecosystem and use it to find candidates for hiring; other recruiters struggle with the interpretation of signals and issues of trust. This mutual assessment is changing how software engineers collaborate and how they advance their skills.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Leibniz University of Hanover", "Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Leif Singer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singer:Leif", "Fernando Marques Figueira Filho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filho:Fernando_Marques_Figueira", "Brendan Cleary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cleary:Brendan", "Christoph Treude.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Treude:Christoph", "Margaret-Anne D.
