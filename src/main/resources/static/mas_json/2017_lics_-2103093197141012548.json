Our main result is that the acceptance of an infinitary \u03bb-term by a higher-order parity automaton A is decidable, whenever the infinitary \u03bb-term is generated by a finite and simply-typed \u03bbY-term. The decidability theorem is established by combining ideas coming from linear logic, from denotational semantics and from infinitary rewriting theory.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Paris"], "authors": ["Paul-Andr\u00e9 Melli\u00e8s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melli=egrave=s:Paul=Andr=eacute="], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
