We show that any (randomized) data structure for the problem that answers $c$-approximate nearest neighbor search queries using $t$ probes must use space at least $n^{1+\\Omega(1/ct)}$. In particular, our bound implies that any data structure that uses space $\\tilde{O}(n)$ with polylogarithmic word size, and with constant probability gives a constant approximation to nearest neighbor search queries must be probed $\\Omega(\\log n/ \\log\\log n)$ times. This improves on the lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log\\log d/\\log\\log\\log d)$ probes shown by Chakrabarti and Regev~\\cite{ChakrabartiR04} for any polynomial space data structure, and the $\\Omega(\\log\\log d)$ lower bound in \\Patrascu and Thorup~\\cite{PatrascuT07} for linear space data structures.Our lower bound holds for the {\\em near neighbor problem}, where the algorithm knows in advance a good approximation to the distance to the nearest neighbor.Additionally, it is an {\\em average case} lower bound for the natural distribution for the problem. Our approach also gives the same bound for $(2-\\frac{1}{c})$-approximation to the farthest neighbor problem.For the case of non-adaptive algorithms we can improve the bound slightly and show a $\\Omega(\\log n)$ lower bound on the time complexity of data structures with $O(n)$ space and logarithmic word size.We also show similar lower bounds for the partial match problem: any randomized $t$-probe data structure that solves the partial match problem on $\\{0,1,\\star\\}^d$ for $d=\\Theta(\\log n)$ must use space $n^{1+\\Omega(1/t)}$. This implies an $\\Omega(\\log n/\\log\\log n)$ lower bound for time complexity of near linear space data structures, slightly improving the $\\Omega(\\log n /(\\log \\log n)^2)$ lower bound from~\\cite{PatrascuT06a},\\cite{JayramKKR03} for this range of $d$. Recently and independently \\Patrascu achieved similar bounds \\cite{patrascu08}. Our results also generalize to approximate partial match, improving on the bounds of \\cite{BarkolR02,PatrascuT06a}.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Rina Panigrahy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panigrahy:Rina", "Kunal Talwar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talwar:Kunal", "Udi Wieder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wieder:Udi"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
