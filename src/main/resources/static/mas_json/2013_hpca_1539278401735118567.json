{"title": "SCRAP: Architecture for signature-based protection from Code Reuse Attacks.", "fields": ["system software", "code injection", "commit", "code reuse", "binary code compatibility"], "abstract": "Code Reuse Attacks (CRAs) recently emerged as a new class of security exploits. CRAs construct malicious programs out of small fragments (gadgets) of existing code, thus eliminating the need for code injection. Existing defenses against CRAs often incur large performance overheads or require extensive binary rewriting and other changes to the system software. In this paper, we examine a signature-based detection of CRAs, where the attack is detected by observing the behavior of programs and detecting the gadget execution patterns. We first demonstrate that naive signature-based defenses can be defeated by introducing special \u201cdelay gadgets\u201d as part of the attack. We then show how a software-configurable signature-based approach can be designed to defend against such stealth CRAs, including the attacks that manage to use longer-length gadgets. The proposed defense (called SCRAP) can be implemented entirely in hardware using simple logic at the commit stage of the pipeline. SCRAP is realized with minimal performance cost, no changes to the software layers and no implications on binary compatibility. Finally, we show that SCRAP generates no false alarms on a wide range of applications.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Binghamton University", "Binghamton University", "Binghamton University", "Binghamton University", "Binghamton University"], "authors": ["Mehmet Kayaalp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kayaalp:Mehmet", "Timothy Schmitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmitt:Timothy", "Junaid Nomani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nomani:Junaid", "Dmitry Ponomarev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponomarev:Dmitry", "Nael B.
