{"title": "Efficient activity detection with max-subgraph search.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "graph theory", "categorization", "object detection", "graph"], "abstract": "We propose an efficient approach that unifies activity categorization with space-time localization. The main idea is to pose activity detection as a maximum-weight connected subgraph problem over a learned space-time graph constructed on the test sequence. We show this permits an efficient branch-and-cut solution for the best-scoring \u2014 and possibly non-cubically shaped \u2014 portion of the video for a given activity classifier. The upshot is a fast method that can evaluate a broader space of candidates than was previously practical, which we find often leads to more accurate detection. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on three datasets, and show its speed and accuracy advantages over multiple existing search strategies.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chao-Yeh Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chao=Yeh", "Kristen Grauman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grauman:Kristen"], "pages": 8}
