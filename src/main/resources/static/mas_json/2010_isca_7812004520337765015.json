{"title": "Data marshaling for multi-core architectures.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "pipeline", "cache", "byte", "marshalling"], "abstract": "Previous research has shown that Staged Execution (SE), i.e., dividing a program into segments and executing each segment at the core that has the data and/or functionality to best run that segment, can improve performance and save power. However, SE's benefit is limited because most segments access  inter-segment data , i.e., data generated by the previous segment. When consecutive segments run on different cores, accesses to inter-segment data incur cache misses, thereby reducing performance. This paper proposes  Data Marshaling (DM) , a new technique to eliminate cache misses to inter-segment data. DM uses profiling to identify instructions that generate inter-segment data, and adds only 96 bytes/core of storage overhead. We show that DM significantly improves the performance of two promising Staged Execution models, Accelerated Critical Sections and producer-consumer pipeline parallelism, on both homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-core systems. In both models, DM can achieve almost all of the potential of ideally eliminating cache misses to inter-segment data. DM's performance benefit increases with the number of cores.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["M.
