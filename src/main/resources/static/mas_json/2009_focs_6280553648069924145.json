Given a graph $(V,E)$ with a cost on each edge and a penalty (a.k.a. prize) on each node, the goal is to find a tree (for PCST), cycle (for PCTSP), or path (for PC-Path) that minimizes the sum of the edge costs in the tree/cycle/path and the penalties of the nodes not spanned by it. In addition to being a useful theoretical tool for helping to solve other optimization problems, PCST has been applied fruitfully by ATT a 2-approximation for PC-Path appeared in 2003. The natural linear programming relaxation of PCST has an integrality gap of 2, which has been a barrier to further improvements for this problem. We present $(2-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for all three problems, connected by a unified technique for improving prize-collecting algorithms that allows us to circumvent the integrality gap barrier. Specifically, our approximation ratio for prize-collecting Steiner tree is below 1.9672.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "departments": ["AT&T", "Princeton University", "AT&T Labs", "Princeton University", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs"], "authors": ["Aaron Archer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Archer:Aaron", "MohammadHossein Bateni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bateni:MohammadHossein", "Mohammad Taghi Hajiaghayi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hajiaghayi:Mohammad_Taghi", "Howard J.
