{"title": "Development History Granularity Transformations (N).", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "software", "maintenance engineering", "architecture", "granularity"], "abstract": "Development histories can simplify some software engineering tasks, butdifferent tasks require different history granularities. For example, ahistory that includes every edit that resulted in compiling code is neededwhen searching for the cause of a regression, whereas a history that containsonly changes relevant to a feature is needed for understanding the evolutionof the feature. Unfortunately, today, both manual and automated historygeneration result in a single-granularity history. This paper introduces theconcept of multi-grained development history views and the architecture ofCodebase Manipulation, a tool that automatically records a fine-grainedhistory and manages its granularity by applying granularity transformations.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Kivan\u00e7 Muslu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muslu:Kivan=ccedil=", "Luke Swart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swart:Luke", "Yuriy Brun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brun:Yuriy", "Michael D.
