{"title": "Fido: Fast Inter-Virtual-Machine Communication for Enterprise Appliances.", "fields": ["systems architecture", "component based software engineering", "device file", "storage virtualization", "virtualization"], "abstract": "Enterprise-class server appliances such as network-attached storage systems or network routers can benefit greatly from virtualization technologies. However, current inter-VM communication techniques have significant performance overheads when employed between highly-collaborative appliance components, thereby limiting the use of virtualization in such systems. We present Fido, an inter-VM communication mechanism that leverages the inherent relaxed trust model between the software components in an appliance to achieve high performance. We have also developed common device abstractions - a network device (MMNet) and a block device (MMBlk) on top of Fido.\n\nWe evaluate MMNet and MMBlk using microbench-marks and find that they outperform existing alternative mechanisms. As a case study, we have implemented a virtualized architecture for a network-attached storage system incorporating Fido, MMNet, and MMBlk. We use both microbenchmarks and TPC-C to evaluate our virtualized storage system architecture. In comparison to a monolithic architecture, the virtualized one exhibits nearly no performance penalty in our benchmarks, thus demonstrating the viability of virtualized enterprise server architectures that use Fido.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "NetApp", "NetApp", "NetApp", "NetApp"], "authors": ["Anton Burtsev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burtsev:Anton", "Kiran Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Kiran", "Prashanth Radhakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radhakrishnan:Prashanth", "Kaladhar Voruganti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voruganti:Kaladhar", "Garth R.
