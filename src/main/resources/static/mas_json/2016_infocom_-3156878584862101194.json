Through the \u201cworld-of-mouth\u201d exchanges, so-called viral marketing, the influence and product adoption can spread from few key influencers to billions of users in the network. To identify those key influencers, a great amount of work has been devoted for the Influence Maximization (IM) problem that seeks a set of k seed users that maximize the expected influence. Unfortunately, IM encloses two impractical assumptions: 1) any seed user can be acquired with the same cost and 2) all users are equally interested in the advertisement. In this paper, we propose a new problem, called Cost-aware Targeted Viral Marketing (CTVM), to find the most cost-effective seed users who can influence the most relevant users to the advertisement. Since CTVM is NP-hard, we design an efficient (1 \u2212 1/\u221ae-\u220a \u2212 e)-approximation algorithm, named BCT, to solve the problem in billion-scale networks. Comparing with IM algorithms, we show that BCT is both theoretically and experimentally faster than the state-of-the-arts while providing better solution quality. Moreover, we prove that under the Linear Threshold model, BCT is the first sub-linear time algorithm for CTVM (and IM) in dense networks. In our experiments with a Twitter dataset, containing 1.46 billions of social relations and 106 millions tweets, BCT can identify key influencers in each trending topic in only few minutes.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Virginia Commonwealth University", "Virginia Commonwealth University", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Hung T.
