{"title": "Symbolic Model Checking of Product-Line Requirements Using SAT-Based Methods.", "fields": ["boolean function", "model checking", "correctness", "data structure", "interpolation"], "abstract": "Product line (PL) engineering promotes the development of  families  of related products, where individual products are differentiated by which optional features they include. Modelling and analyzing requirements models of PLs allows for early detection and correction of requirements errors -- including unintended feature interactions, which are a serious problem in feature-rich systems. A key challenge in analyzing PL requirements is the efficient verification of the product family, given that the number of products is too large to be verified one at a time. Recently, it has been shown how the high-level design of an entire PL, that includes all possible products, can be compactly represented as a single model in the SMV language, and model checked using the NuSMV tool. The implementation in NuSMV uses BDDs, a method that has been outperformed by SAT-based algorithms.   In this paper we develop PL model checking using two leading SAT-based symbolic model checking algorithms: IMC and IC3. We describe the algorithms, prove their correctness, and report on our implementation. Evaluating our methods on three PL models from the literature, we demonstrate an improvement of up to 3 orders of magnitude over the existing BDD-based method.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Shoham Ben-David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=David:Shoham", "Baruch Sterin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sterin:Baruch", "Joanne M.
