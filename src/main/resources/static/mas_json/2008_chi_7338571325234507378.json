{"title": "Exploring the role of the reader in the activity of blogging.", "fields": ["temporality", "popular culture", "social practice", "qualitative research", "mass media"], "abstract": "Within the last decade, blogs have become an important element of popular culture, mass media, and the daily lives of countless Internet users. Despite the medium's interactive nature, most research on blogs focuses on either the blog itself or the blogger, rarely if at all focusing on the reader's impact. In order to gain a better understanding of the social practice of blogging, we must take into account the role, contributions, and significance of the reader. This paper presents the findings of a qualitative study of blog readers, including common blog reading practices, some of the dimensions along which reading practices vary, relationships between identity presentation and perception, the interpretation of temporality, and the ways in which readers feel that they are a part of the blogs they read. It also describes similarities to, and discrepancies with, previous work, and suggests a number of directions and implications for future work on blogging.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Eric Baumer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baumer:Eric", "Mark Sueyoshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sueyoshi:Mark", "Bill Tomlinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomlinson:Bill"], "pages": 10}
