{"title": "Alpha-Beta Pruning for Games with Simultaneous Moves.", "fields": ["killer heuristic", "principal variation search", "negamax", "null move heuristic", "monte carlo tree search", "alpha beta pruning"], "abstract": "Alpha-Beta pruning is one of the most powerful and fundamental MiniMax search improvements. It was designed for sequential two-player zero-sum perfect information games. Inthis paper we introduce an Alpha-Beta-like sound pruning method for the more general class of \"stacked matrix games\" that allow for simultaneous moves by both players. This is accomplished by maintaining upper and lower bounds for achievable payoffs in states with simultaneous actions and dominated action pruning based on the feasibility of certain linear programs. Empirical data shows considerable savings in terms of expanded nodes compared to naive depth-first move computation without pruning.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University", "Reykjav\u00edk University", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Abdallah Saffidine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saffidine:Abdallah", "Hilmar Finnsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finnsson:Hilmar", "Michael Buro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buro:Michael"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
