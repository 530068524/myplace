For instance, the popular shortest path kernel scales as O(n4), where n is the number of nodes. In this paper, we present a class of graph kernels with computational complexity O(n2(m + log n + \u03b42 + d)), where \u03b4 is the graph diameter, m is the number of edges, and d is the dimension of the node attributes. Due to the sparsity and small diameter of real-world graphs, these kernels typically scale comfortably to large graphs. In our experiments, the presented kernels outperform state-of-the-art kernels in terms of speed and accuracy on classification benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Aasa Feragen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feragen:Aasa", "Niklas Kasenburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasenburg:Niklas", "Jens Petersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petersen:Jens", "Marleen de Bruijne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruijne:Marleen_de", "Karsten M.
