However, diverging input and output fidelities of these devices can lead to interaction seams that can inhibit efficient mobile interaction, when users employ multiple devices at once. We present MultiFi, an interactive system that combines the strengths of multiple displays and overcomes the seams of mobile interaction with widgets distributed over multiple devices. A comparative user study indicates that combined head-mounted display and smartwatch interfaces can outperform interaction with single wearable devices.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "University of St Andrews", "Graz University of Technology", "University of T ... , Graz, Austria"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jens Grubert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grubert:Jens", "Matthias Heinisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinisch:Matthias", "Aaron J.
