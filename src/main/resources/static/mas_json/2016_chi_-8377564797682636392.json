In this paper, we present the concept of closeness to comparison to improve the efficacy of social comparison feedback. Specifically, we test two design strategies related to closeness: (1) comparing users to a target described as a similarly experienced player and (2) adjusting the visual representation of performance so player scores appear closer to the comparison target. We evaluate the effects of these strategies for social comparison on player performance in an online game. In a controlled experiment with 425 participants, both feedback techniques improved game performance, but only for experienced players. We conclude with design implications for helping designers create social comparisons that motivate higher game performance.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Lucas Colusso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colusso:Lucas", "Gary Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Gary", "Sean A.
