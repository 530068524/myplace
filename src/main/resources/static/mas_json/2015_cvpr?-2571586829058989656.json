Variances in the pose, scale or rotation usually make the problem more difficult. Most fine-grained classification systems follow the pipeline of finding foreground object or object parts (where) to extract discriminative features (what).", "citation": "Citations (212)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Peking University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Peking University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tianjun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Tianjun", "Yichong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yichong", "Kuiyuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Kuiyuan", "Jiaxing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jiaxing", "Yuxin Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Yuxin", "Zheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zheng"], "pages": 9}
