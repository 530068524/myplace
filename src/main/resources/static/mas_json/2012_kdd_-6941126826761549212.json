We employ a subset of empty region graphs - the \u03b2-skeleton - and non-linear diffusion to define a locally-adapted affinity matrix, which, as we demonstrate, provides higher quality clustering than conventional approaches based on \u03ba nearest neighbors or global scale parameters. Moreover, we show that the clustering quality is far less sensitive to the choice of \u03b2 and other algorithm parameters, and to transformations such as geometric distortion and random perturbation. We summarize the results of an empirical study that applies our method to a number of 2D synthetic data sets, consisting of clusters of arbitrary shape and scale, and to real multi-dimensional classification examples from benchmarks, including image segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Carlos D.
