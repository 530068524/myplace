To gain a better understanding of the social requirements involved with forming exercise groups, we conducted a two-phased exploratory study involving an online web questionnaire with 96 respondents and two focus groups. Our results highlight various aspects of collaborating with exercise partners, but also indicate the limited utility of currently available systems to support such collaborations. We discuss implications for collaborative technologies supporting exercise group formation.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mike Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Mike", "Abhishek Ranjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranjan:Abhishek", "Khai N.
