We train a convolutional neural network to predict how well two image patches match and use it to compute the stereo matching cost. The cost is refined by cross-based cost aggregation and semiglobal matching, followed by a left-right consistency check to eliminate errors in the occluded regions. Our stereo method achieves an error rate of 2.61% on the KITTI stereo dataset and is currently (August 2014) the top performing method on this dataset.", "citation": "Citations (275)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Ljubljana", "New York University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jure Zbontar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zbontar:Jure", "Yann LeCun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/LeCun:Yann"], "pages": 8}
