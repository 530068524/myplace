We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types of architectures, from single-socket -- uniform and non-uniform -- to multi-socket -- directory and broadcast-based -- many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly speaking, imply that scalability of synchronization is mainly a property of the hardware.", "citation": "Citations (172)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Tudor David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/David:Tudor", "Rachid Guerraoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerraoui:Rachid", "Vasileios Trigonakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trigonakis:Vasileios"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2013", "pages": 16}
