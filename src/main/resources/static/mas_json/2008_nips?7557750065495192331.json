While classical treatments have made unrealistic site independence assumptions, ignoring insertions and deletions, realistic approaches require tracking insertions and deletions along the phylogenetic tree\u2014a challenging and unsolved computational problem. We propose a new ancestry resampling procedure for inference in evolutionary trees. We evaluate our method in two problem domains\u2014multiple sequence alignment and reconstruction of ancestral sequences\u2014and show substantial improvement over the current state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alexandre Bouchard-C\u00f4t\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouchard=C=ocirc=t=eacute=:Alexandre", "Michael I.
