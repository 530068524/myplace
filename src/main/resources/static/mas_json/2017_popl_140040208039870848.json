Introducing a  saturation  phase gives a notion of quasi-normal forms in presence of positive types (sum types and the empty type). This rich structure let us prove the decidability of I\ufffdI\u00b7-equivalence in presence of the empty type, the fact that it coincides with contextual equivalence, and with set-theoretic equality in all finite models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Gabriel Scherer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scherer:Gabriel"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
