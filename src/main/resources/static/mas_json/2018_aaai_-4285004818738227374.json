Specifically, we assume that the candidates have certain attributes (such as being a male or a female, being junior or senior, etc.) and the goal is to elect a committee that, on the one hand, has as high a score regarding a given performance measure, but that, on the other hand, meets certain requirements (e.g., of the form \"at least $30\\%$ of the committee members are junior candidates and at least $40\\%$ are females\"). We analyze the computational complexity of computing winning committees in this model, obtaining polynomial-time algorithms (exact and approximate) and NP-hardness results. We focus on several natural classes of voting rules and diversity constraints.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "AGH University of Science and Technology", "University of Oxford", "Vienna University of Technology", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Robert Bredereck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bredereck:Robert", "Piotr Faliszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faliszewski:Piotr", "Ayumi Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Ayumi", "Martin Lackner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lackner:Martin", "Piotr Skowron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skowron:Piotr"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
