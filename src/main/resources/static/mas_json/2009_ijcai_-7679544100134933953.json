{"title": "A Computational Model for the Alignment of Hierarchical Scene Representations in Human-Robot Interaction.", "fields": ["machine learning", "human robot interaction", "robot", "time of flight", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "The ultimate goal of human-robot interaction is to enable the robot to seamlessly communicate with a human in a natural human-like fashion. Most work in this field concentrates on the speech interpretation and gesture recognition side assuming that a propositional scene representation is available. Less work was dedicated to the extraction of relevant scene structures that underlies these propositions. As a consequence, most approaches are restricted to place recognition or simple table top settings and do not generalize to more complex room setups. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical spatial model that is empirically motivated from psycholinguistic studies. Using this model the robot is able to extract scene structures from a time-of-flight depth sensor and adjust its spatial scene representation by taking verbal statements about partial scene aspects into account. Without assuming any pre-known model of the specific room, we show that the system aligns its sensor-based room representation to a semantically meaningful representation typically used by the human descriptor.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Bielefeld University", "Bielefeld University", "Bielefeld University", "Bielefeld University"], "authors": ["Agnes Swadzba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swadzba:Agnes", "Sven Wachsmuth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wachsmuth:Sven", "Constanze Vorwerg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vorwerg:Constanze", "Gert Rickheit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rickheit:Gert"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
