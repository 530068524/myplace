{"title": "Fit4life: the design of a persuasive technology promoting healthy behavior and ideal weight.", "fields": ["critical design", "systems design", "persuasion", "persuasive technology", "simulation"], "abstract": "This is a critical design paper offering a possible scenario of use intended to provoke reflection about values and politics of design in persuasive computing. We describe the design of a system - Fit4Life - that encourages individuals to address the larger goal of reducing obesity in society by promoting individual healthy behaviors. Using the Persuasive Systems Design Model [26], this paper outlines the Fit4Life persuasion context, the technology, its use of persuasive messages, and an experimental design to test the system's efficacy. We also contribute a novel discussion of the ethical and sociocultural considerations involved in our design, an issue that has remained largely unaddressed in the existing persuasive technologies literature [29].", "citation": "Citations (226)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Stephen Purpura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Purpura:Stephen", "Victoria Schwanda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwanda:Victoria", "Kaiton Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Kaiton", "William Stubler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stubler:William", "Phoebe Sengers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sengers:Phoebe"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
