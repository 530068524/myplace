The goal is to identify individuals who when influenced to leave gangs will propagate this action. We study this emerging application by exploring specific facets of the problem that must be addressed when modeling this particular situation. We formulate a new influence maximization variant - the \"social incentive influence\" (SII) problem and study it both formally and in the context of the law-enforcement domain. Using new techniques from unconstrained submodular maximization, we develop an approximation algorithm for SII and present a suite of experimental results - including tests on real-world police data from Chicago.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Military Academy", "Military Academy", "Chicago Police Department"], "authors": ["Paulo Shakarian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shakarian:Paulo", "Joseph Salmento.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salmento:Joseph", "William R.
