In our framework the summarization desideratum is expressed as a sum of a submodular function and a nonsubmodular function, which we call dispersion; the latter uses inter-sentence dissimilarities in different ways in order to ensure non-redundancy of the summary. We consider three natural dispersion functions and show that a greedy algorithm can obtain an approximately optimal summary in all three cases. We conduct experiments on two corpora\u2014DUC 2004 and user comments on news articles\u2014and show that the performance of our algorithm outperforms those that rely only on submodularity.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Google", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Anirban Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta_0001:Anirban", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi", "Sujith Ravi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravi:Sujith"], "pages": 9}
