{"title": "The farm: where pig scripts are bred and raised.", "fields": ["analytics", "natural language user interface", "executable", "scripting language", "interpreter"], "abstract": "Even though scripting languages like Pig allow for simpler coding, performing analytics over Big Data using Map-Reduce engines remains challenging. To further assist developers, and support novice users, we offer \"The Farm\", a catalog of scriptable services supporting creation, discovery, composition, and optimized execution. Each Pig script added to The Farm becomes an executable service, with inputs and outputs defined by relation schemas. Those services are discoverable using natural language search, and composable using a drag-and-drop interface. To support efficient execution, composed services are automatically merged to a single executable script, which can then be run by a growing selection of platform-specific optimizers and interpreters.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Craig P.
