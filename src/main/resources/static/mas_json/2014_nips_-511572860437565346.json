{"title": "PAC-Bayesian AUC classification and scoring.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "feature selection", "gaussian", "gaussian process", "particle filter"], "abstract": "We develop a scoring and classification procedure based on the PAC-Bayesian approach and the AUC (Area Under Curve) criterion. We focus initially on the class of linear score functions. We derive PAC-Bayesian non-asymptotic bounds for two types of prior for the score parameters: a Gaussian prior, and a spike-and-slab prior; the latter makes it possible to perform feature selection. One important advantage of our approach is that it is amenable to powerful Bayesian computational tools. We derive in particular a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, as an efficient method which may be used as a gold standard, and an Expectation-Propagation algorithm, as a much faster but approximate method. We also extend our method to a class of non-linear score functions, essentially leading to a nonparametric procedure, by considering a Gaussian process prior.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["CEREMADE", "ENSAE ParisTech", "HEC Paris", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["James Ridgway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ridgway:James", "Pierre Alquier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alquier:Pierre", "Nicolas Chopin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chopin:Nicolas", "Feng Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Feng"], "pages": 9}
