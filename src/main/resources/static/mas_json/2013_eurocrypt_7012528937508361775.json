The prover must return the output of the computation, along with a cryptographic proof to be used for verifying the correctness of the output. Due to the nature of the streaming setting, the verifier can only keep small local state (e.g., logarithmic) which must be updatable in a streaming manner and with no interaction with the prover. Such constraints make the problem particularly challenging and rule out applying existing verifiable computation schemes.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Brown University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Charalampos Papamanthou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papamanthou:Charalampos", "Elaine Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Elaine", "Roberto Tamassia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamassia:Roberto", "Ke Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Ke"], "pages": 18}
