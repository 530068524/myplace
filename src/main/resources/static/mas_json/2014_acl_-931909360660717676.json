{"title": "Incremental Joint Extraction of Entity Mentions and Relations.", "fields": ["automatic content extraction", "security token", "perceptron", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present an incremental joint framework to simultaneously extract entity mentions and relations using structured perceptron with efficient beam-search. A segment-based decoder based on the idea of semi-Markov chain is adopted to the new framework as opposed to traditional token-based tagging. In addition, by virtue of the inexact search, we developed a number of new and effective global features as soft constraints to capture the interdependency among entity mentions and relations. Experiments on Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) 1 corpora demonstrate that our joint model significantly outperforms a strong pipelined baseline, which attains better performance than the best-reported end-to-end system.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Qi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0014:Qi", "Heng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Heng"], "pages": 11}
