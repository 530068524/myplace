{"title": "Fast and high-performance template matching method.", "fields": ["object detection", "hamming distance", "hamming code", "template matching", "video tracking"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a new template matching method that is robust to outliers and fast enough for real-time operation. The template and image are densely transformed in binary code form by projecting and quantizing histograms of oriented gradients. The binary codes are matched by a generic method of robust similarity applicable to additive match measures, such as L p - and Hamming distances. The robust similarity map is computed efficiently via a proposed Inverted Location Index structure that stores pixel locations indexed by their values. The method is experimentally justified in large image patch datasets. Challenging applications, such as intra-category object detection, object tracking, and multimodal image matching are demonstrated.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["ASL Vision, Lew ...
