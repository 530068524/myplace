In this paper, we propose an approach to use comparative object similarity. The key insight is that: given a set of object categories which are similar and a set of categories which are dissimilar, a good object model should respond more strongly to examples from similar categories than to examples from dissimilar categories. We develop a regularized kernel machine algorithm to use this category dependent similarity regularization. Our experiments on hundreds of categories show that our method can make significant improvement, especially for categories with no examples.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Gang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0012:Gang", "David A.
