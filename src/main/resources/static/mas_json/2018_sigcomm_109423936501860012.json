{"title": "Automated synthesis of adversarial workloads for network functions.", "fields": ["network packet", "operator", "cache", "symbolic execution", "software deployment"], "abstract": "Software network functions promise to simplify the deployment of network services and reduce network operation cost. However, they face the challenge of unpredictable performance. Given this performance variability, it is imperative that during deployment, network operators consider the performance of the NF not only for typical but also adversarial workloads. We contribute a tool that helps solve this challenge: it takes as input the LLVM code of a network function and outputs packet sequences that trigger slow execution paths. Under the covers, it combines directed symbolic execution with a sophisticated cache model to look for execution paths that incur many CPU cycles and involve adversarial memory-access patterns. We used our tool on 11 network functions that implement a variety of data structures and discovered workloads that can in some cases triple latency and cut throughput by 19% relative to typical testing workloads.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Luis Pedrosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedrosa:Luis", "Rishabh K.
