The aim is to find a mapping such that the cost of $S(X)$ is as close as possible to the optimal set cover cost for $X$. (Such problems are also called oblivious or a priori optimization problems.) Unfortunately, for every universal mapping, the cost of $S(X)$ can be $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ times larger than optimal if the set $X$ is adversarially chosen. In this paper we study the performance on average, when $X$ is a set of randomly chosen elements from the universe: we show how to efficiently find a universal map whose expected cost is $O(\\log mn)$ times the expected optimal cost. In fact, we give a slightly improved analysis and show that this is the best possible. We generalize these ideas to weighted set cover and ...", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "Dipt. di Inf.
