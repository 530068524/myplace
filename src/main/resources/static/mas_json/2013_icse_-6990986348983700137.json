A CDO comprises a combination of a specific cloud environment, deployment architecture, and runtime reconfiguration rules for dynamic resource scaling. Our simulator CDOSim can evaluate CDOs, e.g., regarding response times and costs. However, the design space to be searched for well-suited solutions is extremely huge. In this paper, we approach this optimization problem with the novel genetic algorithm CDOXplorer. It uses techniques of the search-based software engineering field and CDOSim to assess the fitness of CDOs. An experimental evaluation that employs, among others, the cloud environments Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Windows Azure, shows that CDOXplorer can find solutions that surpass those of other state-of-the-art techniques by up to 60%. Our experiment code and data and an implementation of CDOXplorer are available as open source software.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "departments": ["University of Kiel", "University of Kiel", "University of Kiel"], "authors": ["S\u00f6ren Frey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frey:S=ouml=ren", "Florian Fittkau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fittkau:Florian", "Wilhelm Hasselbring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasselbring:Wilhelm"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
