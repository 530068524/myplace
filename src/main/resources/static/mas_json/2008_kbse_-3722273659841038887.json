{"title": "MTSA: The Modal Transition System Analyser.", "fields": ["cognition", "transition system", "analyser", "modal", "merge"], "abstract": "Modal transition systems (MTS) are operational models that distinguish between required and proscribed behaviour of the system to be and behaviour which it is not yet known whether the system should exhibit. MTS, in contrast with traditional behaviour models, support reasoning about the intended system behaviour in the presence of incomplete knowledge. In this paper, we present MTSA a tool that supports the construction, analysis and elaboration of Modal Transition Systems (MTS).", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["University of Buenos Aires", "University of Buenos Aires", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Buenos Aires"], "authors": ["Nicol\u00e1s D'Ippolito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=Ippolito:Nicol=aacute=s", "Dario Fischbein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischbein:Dario", "Marsha Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Marsha", "Sebasti\u00e1n Uchitel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uchitel:Sebasti=aacute=n"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
