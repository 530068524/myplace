{"title": "Product Feature Mining: Semantic Clues versus Syntactic Constituents.", "fields": ["semantic computing", "sentiment analysis", "exploit", "semantic integration", "semantic search"], "abstract": "Product feature mining is a key subtask in fine-grained opinion mining. Previous works often use syntax constituents in this task. However, syntax-based methods can only use discrete contextual information, which may suffer from data sparsity. This paper proposes a novel product feature mining method which leverages lexical and contextual semantic clues. Lexical semantic clue verifies whether a candidate term is related to the target product, and contextual semantic clue serves as a soft pattern miner to find candidates, which exploits semantics of each word in context so as to alleviate the data sparsity problem. We build a semantic similarity graph to encode lexical semantic clue, and employ a convolutional neural model to capture contextual semantic clue. Then Label Propagation is applied to combine both semantic clues. Experimental results show that our semantics-based method significantly outperforms conventional syntaxbased approaches, which not only mines product features more accurately, but also extracts more infrequent product features.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Liheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Liheng", "Kang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Kang", "Siwei Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Siwei", "Jun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Jun"], "pages": 11}
