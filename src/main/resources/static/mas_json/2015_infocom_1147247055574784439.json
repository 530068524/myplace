Secure and usable authentication techniques are indispensable for preventing illegitimate access to mobile devices. This paper presents RhyAuth, a novel two-factor rhythm-based authentication scheme for multi-touch mobile devices. RhyAuth requires a user to perform a sequence of rhythmic taps/slides on a device screen to unlock the device. The user is authenticated and admitted only when the features extracted from her rhythmic taps/slides match those stored on the device. RhyAuth is a two-factor authentication scheme that depends on a user-chosen rhythm and also the behavioral metrics for inputting the rhythm. Through a 32-user experiment on Android devices, we show that RhyAuth is highly secure against various attacks and also very usable for both sighted and visually impaired people.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "University of Hawaii", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Yimin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yimin", "Jingchao Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jingchao", "Rui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Rui", "Yanchao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanchao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
