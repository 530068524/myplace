While prior approaches have shown that binary code can be extracted and reused, they are often based on static analysis and face challenges when coping with obfuscated binaries. This paper introduces trace-oriented programming (TOP), a general framework for generating new software from existing binary code by elevating the low-level binary code to C code with templates and inlined assembly. Different from existing work, TOP gains benefits from dynamic analysis such as resilience against obfuscation and avoidance of points-to analysis. Thus, TOP can be used for malware analysis, especially for malware function analysis and identification. We have implemented a proof-of-concept of TOP and our evaluation results with a range of benign and malicious software indicate that TOP is able to reconstruct source code from binary execution traces in malware analysis and identification, and binary function transplanting.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Purdue University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Junyuan Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Junyuan", "Yangchun Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Yangchun", "Kenneth A.
