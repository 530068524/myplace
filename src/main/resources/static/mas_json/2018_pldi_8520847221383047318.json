{"title": "Active learning of points-to specifications.", "fields": ["information flow", "android", "unit testing", "machine code", "active learning"], "abstract": "When analyzing programs, large libraries pose significant challenges to static points-to analysis. A popular solution is to have a human analyst provide points-to specifications that summarize relevant behaviors of library code, which can substantially improve precision and handle missing code such as native code. We propose Atlas, a tool that automatically infers points-to specifications. Atlas synthesizes unit tests that exercise the library code, and then infers points-to specifications based on observations from these executions. Atlas automatically infers specifications for the Java standard library, and produces better results for a client static information flow analysis on a benchmark of 46 Android apps compared to using existing handwritten specifications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Microsoft", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Osbert Bastani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bastani:Osbert", "Rahul Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma_0001:Rahul", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex", "Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2018", "pages": 15}
