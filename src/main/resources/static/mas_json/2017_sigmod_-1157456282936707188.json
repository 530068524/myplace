However, the performance of individual designs suffers when the workload characteristics miss their small sweet spot of a desired contention level, read-write ratio, record size, processing rate, and so forth.   Cicada is a single-node multi-core in-memory transactional database with serializability. To provide high performance under diverse workloads, Cicada reduces overhead and contention at several levels of the system by leveraging optimistic and multi-version concurrency control schemes and multiple loosely synchronized clocks while mitigating their drawbacks. On the TPC-C and YCSB benchmarks, Cicada outperforms Silo, TicToc, FOEDUS, MOCC, two-phase locking, Hekaton, and ERMIA in most scenarios, achieving up to 3X higher throughput than the next fastest design. It handles up to 2.07 M TPC-C transactions per second and 56.5 M YCSB transactions per second, and scans up to 356 M records per second on a single 28-core machine.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Intel", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Hyeontaek Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Hyeontaek", "Michael Kaminsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaminsky:Michael", "David G.
