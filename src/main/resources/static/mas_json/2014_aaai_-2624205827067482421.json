We seek to develop an intelligent system that generates computer games. As first steps towards this goal we present a composable and cross-domain representation for game mechanics that draws from AI planning action representations. We use a constraint solver to generate mechanics subject to design requirements on the form of those mechanics--what they do in the game. A planner takes a set of generated mechanics and tests whether those mechanics meet playability requirements--controlling how mechanics function in a game to affect player behavior. We demonstrate our system by modeling and generating mechanics in a role-playing game, platformer game, and combined role-playing-platformer game.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Alexander Zook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zook:Alexander", "Mark O.
