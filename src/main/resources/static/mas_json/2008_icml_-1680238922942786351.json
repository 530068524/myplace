The proposed algorithm constructs a nested sequence of successively tighter relaxations of the original  MMC  problem, and each optimization problem in this sequence could be efficiently solved using the  constrained concave-convex procedure  ( CCCP ). Experimental evaluations on several real world datasets show that our algorithm converges much faster than existing  MMC  methods with guaranteed accuracy, and can thus handle much larger datasets efficiently.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Bin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Bin", "Fei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Fei", "Changshui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changshui"], "pages": 8}
