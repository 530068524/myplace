Intelligibility, in ubiquitous computing applications, explains to users what a system did (outputs) and why it did it (inputs or contextual information). Making software more intelligible can reduce the complexity of a system for users. This paper presents our work on an intelligibility strategy for fuzzy logic systems, applied to a context-aware software organization and service provision (SOSP) middleware for smart environments. This fuzzy logic intelligibility strategy has been evaluated and tested with two groups of real users (technical and less technical users), and two versions of our prototype (with and without intelligibility).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Charles Gouin-Vallerand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gouin=Vallerand:Charles", "Brian Y.
