{"title": "Automating wavefront parallelization for sparse matrix computations.", "fields": ["compiler", "wavefront", "speedup", "sparse matrix", "task parallelism"], "abstract": "This paper presents a compiler and runtime framework for parallelizing sparse matrix computations that have loop-carried dependences. Our approach automatically generates a runtime inspector to collect data dependence information and achieves wavefront parallelization of the computation, where iterations within a wavefront execute in parallel, and synchronization is required across wavefronts. A key contribution of this paper involves dependence simplification, which reduces the time and space overhead of the inspector. This is implemented within a polyhedral compiler framework, extended for sparse matrix codes. Results demonstrate the feasibility of using automatically-generated inspectors and executors to optimize ILU factorization and symmetric Gauss-Seidel relaxations, which are part of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) computation. Our implementation achieves a median speedup of 2.97\u00d7 on 12 cores over the reference sequential PCG implementation, significantly outperforms PCG parallelized using Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL), and is within 6% of the median performance of manually-parallelized PCG.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Intel", "University of Arizona", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Anand Venkat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkat:Anand", "Mahdi Soltan Mohammadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohammadi:Mahdi_Soltan", "Jongsoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jongsoo", "Hongbo Rong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rong:Hongbo", "Rajkishore Barik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barik:Rajkishore", "Michelle Mills Strout.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strout:Michelle_Mills", "Mary W.
