One often seen bad weather is rain which causes significant yet complex local intensity fluctuations in images. The paper aims at developing an effective algorithm to remove visual effects of rain from a single rainy image, i.e. separate the rain layer and the de-rained image layer from an rainy image. Built upon a non-linear generative model of rainy image, namely screen blend mode, we proposed a dictionary learning based algorithm for single image de-raining. The basic idea is to sparsely approximate the patches of two layers by very high discriminative codes over a learned dictionary with strong mutual exclusivity property. Such discriminative sparse codes lead to accurate separation of two layers from their non-linear composite. The experiments showed that the proposed method outperformed the existing single image de-raining methods on tested rain images.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["South China University of Technology", "South China University of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yu Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Yu", "Yong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yong", "Hui Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Hui"], "pages": 9}
