{"title": "Synthesizing 3D Shapes via Modeling Multi-view Depth Maps and Silhouettes with Deep Generative Networks.", "fields": ["voxel", "generative grammar", "generative model", "high memory", "rendering"], "abstract": "We study the problem of learning generative models of 3D shapes. Voxels or 3D parts have been widely used as the underlying representations to build complex 3D shapes, however, voxel-based representations suffer from high memory requirements, and parts-based models require a large collection of cached or richly parametrized parts. We take an alternative approach: learning a generative model over multi-view depth maps or their corresponding silhouettes, and using a deterministic rendering function to produce 3D shapes from these images. A multi-view representation of shapes enables generation of 3D models with fine details, as 2D depth maps and silhouettes can be modeled at a much higher resolution than 3D voxels. Moreover, our approach naturally brings the ability to recover the underlying 3D representation from depth maps of one or a few viewpoints. Experiments show that our framework can generate 3D shapes with variations and details. We also demonstrate that our model has out-of-sample generalization power for real-world tasks with occluded objects.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Amir Arsalan Soltani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soltani:Amir_Arsalan", "Haibin Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Haibin", "Jiajun Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Jiajun", "Tejas D.
