{"title": "Barriers and Negative Nudges: Exploring Challenges in Food Journaling.", "fields": ["nudge theory", "design and technology", "journaling file system", "qualitative research", "text mining"], "abstract": "Although food journaling is understood to be both important and difficult, little work has empirically documented the specific challenges people experience with food journals. We identify key challenges in a qualitative study combining a survey of 141 current and lapsed food journalers with analysis of 5,526 posts in community forums for three mobile food journals. Analyzing themes in this data, we find and discuss barriers to reliable food entry, negative nudges caused by current techniques, and challenges with social features. Our results motivate research exploring a wider range of approaches to food journal design and technology.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Washington", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Felicia Cordeiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cordeiro:Felicia", "Daniel A.
