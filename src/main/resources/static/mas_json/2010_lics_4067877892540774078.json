{"title": "An Extension of Data Automata that Captures XPath.", "fields": ["nested word", "xpath", "mobile automaton", "quantum finite automata", "growcut algorithm", "\u03c9 automaton", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics"], "abstract": "We define a new kind of automata recognizing properties of data words or data trees and prove that the automata capture all queries definable in Regular XPath. We show that the automata-theoretic approach may be applied to answer decidability and expressibility questions for XPath. Finally, we use the newly introduced automata as a common framework to classify existing automata on data words and trees, including data automata, register automata and alternating register automata.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "Studia dzienne  ... st.
