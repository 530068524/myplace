{"title": "Stories from Survivors: Privacy & Security Practices when Coping with Intimate Partner Abuse.", "fields": ["coping", "qualitative research", "leverage", "domestic violence", "usability"], "abstract": "We present a qualitative study of the digital privacy and security motivations, practices, and challenges of survivors of intimate partner abuse (IPA). This paper provides a framework for organizing survivors' technology practices and challenges into three phases: physical control, escape, and life apart. This three-phase framework combines technology practices with three phases of abuse to provide an empirically sound method for technology creators to consider how survivors of IPA can leverage new and existing technologies. Overall, our results suggest that the usability of and control over privacy and security functions should be or continue to be high priorities for technology creators seeking ways to better support survivors of IPA.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tara Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Tara", "Kathleen O'Leary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Leary:Kathleen", "Anna Turner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turner:Anna", "Manya Sleeper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sleeper:Manya", "Jill Palzkill Woelfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woelfer:Jill_Palzkill", "Martin Shelton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shelton:Martin", "Cori Manthorne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manthorne:Cori", "Elizabeth F.
