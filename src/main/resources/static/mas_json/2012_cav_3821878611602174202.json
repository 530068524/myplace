When programmers write such manipulations, they typically have a clear high-level intuition about how the manipulation should work, but implementing efficient low-level pointer manipulating code is error-prone. Our tool aims to bridge the gap between the intuition and the corresponding implementation by automatically synthesizing the implementation. The tool frames the synthesis problem as a generalization of an abstract-interpretation based shape analysis, and represents the problem as a set of constraints which are solved efficiently by the Sketch solver. We report the successful evaluation of our tool on synthesizing several linked list and binary search tree manipulations.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Rishabh Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Rishabh", "Armando Solar-Lezama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solar=Lezama:Armando"], "pages": 6}
