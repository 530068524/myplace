{"title": "Getting the Most Out of Pattern Databases for Classical Planning.", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "heuristic", "linear programming", "abstraction", "heuristics"], "abstract": "The iPDB procedure by Haslum et al. is the state-of-the-art method for computing additive abstraction heuristics for domain-independent planning. It performs a hill-climbing search in the space of pattern collections, combining information from multiple patterns in the so-called canonical heuristic. We show how stronger heuristic estimates can be obtained through linear programming. An experimental evaluation demonstrates the strength of the new technique on the IPC benchmark suite.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Universit\u00e4t Bas ... l, Switzerland", "Universit\u00e4t Bas ... l, Switzerland", "Universit\u00e4t Bas ... l, Switzerland"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Florian Pommerening.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pommerening:Florian", "Gabriele R\u00f6ger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=ouml=ger:Gabriele", "Malte Helmert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmert:Malte"], "pages": 8}
