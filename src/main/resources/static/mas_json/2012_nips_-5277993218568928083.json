However, the inference algorithms are often slow and unwieldy, and are in general highly specific to a given model formulation. In this paper, we describe a large class of dependent nonparametric processes, including several existing models, and present a slice sampler that allows efficient inference across this class of models.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Dartmouth College", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Nicholas J.
