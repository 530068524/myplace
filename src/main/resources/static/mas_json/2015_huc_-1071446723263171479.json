With device-free passive indoor positioning, a wireless sensor network is used to detect the movement of a person based on the fact that RF signals transmitted between a transmitter and a receiver are affected by human movement. However, because device-free passive indoor positioning relies on machine learning techniques, we must collect labeled training data at many training points in an end user's environment. This paper proposes a method that transfers a signal strength model used for locating a person obtained in another environment (source environment) to the end user environment. With the transferred models, we can construct a positioning model for the end user environment inexpensively. Our evaluation showed that our method achieved almost the same positioning performance as a supervised method that requires labeled training data obtained in an end user's environment.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "NTT Communicati ... ce Laboratories", "NTT Communicati ... ce Laboratories", "NTT Communicati ... ce Laboratories"], "authors": ["Kazuya Ohara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohara:Kazuya", "Takuya Maekawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maekawa:Takuya", "Yasue Kishino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kishino:Yasue", "Yoshinari Shirai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shirai:Yoshinari", "Futoshi Naya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naya:Futoshi"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
