{"title": "Adaptive linear predictors for real-time tracking.", "fields": ["computer vision", "robustness", "matrix", "template", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Enlarging or reducing the template size by adding new parts, or removing parts of the template, according to their suitability for tracking, requires the ability to deal with the variation of the template size. For instance, real-time template tracking using linear predictors, although fast and reliable, requires using templates of fixed size and does not allow on-line modification of the predictor. To solve this problem we propose the Adaptive Linear Predictors (ALPs) which enable fast online modifications of pre-learned linear predictors. Instead of applying a full matrix inversion for every modification of the template shape as standard approaches to learning linear predictors do, we just perform a fast update of this inverse. This allows us to learn the ALPs in a much shorter time than standard learning approaches while performing equally well. We performed exhaustive evaluation of our approach and compared it to standard linear predictors and other state of the art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Stefan Holzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holzer:Stefan", "Slobodan Ilic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilic:Slobodan", "Nassir Navab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navab:Nassir"], "pages": 8}
