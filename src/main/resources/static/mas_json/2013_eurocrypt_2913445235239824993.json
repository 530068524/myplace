{"title": "Zero-Knowledge Argument for Polynomial Evaluation with Application to Blacklists.", "fields": ["logarithm", "struct", "blacklist", "zero knowledge proof", "discrete mathematics", "polynomial", "mathematics", "mathematical optimization", "mathematical proof"], "abstract": "Verification of a polynomial's evaluation in a secret committed value plays a role in cryptographic applications such as non-membership or mem- bership proofs. We construct a novel special honest verifier zero-knowledge argument for correct polynomial evaluation. The argument has logarithmic com- munication cost in the degree of the polynomial, which is a significant improve- ment over the state of the art with cubic root complexity at best. The argument is relatively efficient to generate and very fast to verify compared to previous work. The argument has a simple public-coin 3-move structure and only relies on the discrete logarithm assumption. The polynomial evaluation argument can be used as a building block to con- struct zero-knowledge membership and non-membership arguments with com- munication that is logarithmic in the size of the blacklist. Non-membership proofs can be used to design anonymous blacklisting schemes allowing online services to block misbehaving users without learning the identity of the user. They also allow the blocking of single users of anonymization networks without blocking the whole network.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Stephanie Bayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bayer:Stephanie", "Jens Groth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Groth:Jens"], "pages": 18}
