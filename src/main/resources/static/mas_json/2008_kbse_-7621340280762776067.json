Save-IDE is specialized for the domain of dependable embedded systems, which in addition to standard design tools requires tool support for analysis and verification of particular properties of such systems.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["M\u00e4lardalen University College", "M\u00e4lardalen University College", "M\u00e4lardalen University College"], "authors": ["S\u00e9verine Sentilles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sentilles:S=eacute=verine", "Paul Pettersson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pettersson:Paul", "Ivica Crnkovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crnkovic:Ivica", "John H\u00e5kansson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=aring=kansson:John"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
