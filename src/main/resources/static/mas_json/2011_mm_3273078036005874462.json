In this paper, we propose a novel QBE-based image retrieval system where users are allowed to submit a short video clip as a query to improve the retrieval reliability. Improvement is achieved by integrating the information about different viewpoints and conditions under which object and scene appearances can be captured across different video frames. Rich information extracted from a video can be exploited to generate a more complete query representation than in the case of a single-image query and to improve the relevance of the retrieved results. Our experimental results show that video-based image retrieval (VBIR) is significantly more reliable than the retrieval using a single image as a query.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Zhejiang University", "Delft University of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Linjun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Linjun", "Yang Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Yang", "Alan Hanjalic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanjalic:Alan", "Xian-Sheng Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Xian=Sheng", "Shipeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shipeng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
