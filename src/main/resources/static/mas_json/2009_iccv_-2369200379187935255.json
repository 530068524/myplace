{"title": "Illumination aware MCMC Particle Filter for long-term outdoor multi-object simultaneous tracking and classification.", "fields": ["foreground background", "eye tracking", "shadow", "markov chain monte carlo", "video tracking"], "abstract": "This paper addresses real-time automatic visual tracking, labeling and classification of a variable number of objects such as pedestrians or/and vehicles, under time-varying illumination conditions. The illumination and multi-object configuration are jointly tracked through a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo Particle Filter (MCMC PF). The measurement is provided by a static camera, associated to a basic foreground / background segmentation. As a first contribution, we propose in this paper to jointly track the light source within the Particle Filter, considering it as an additionnal object. Illumination-dependant shadows cast by objects are modeled and treated as foreground, thus avoiding the difficult task of shadow segmentation. As a second contribution, we estimate object category as a random variable also tracked within the Particle Filter, thus unifying object tracking and classification into a single process. Real time tracking results are shown and discussed on sequences involving various categories of users such as pedestrians, cars, light trucks and heavy trucks.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Blaise Pascal University", "Blaise Pascal University", "Blaise Pascal University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Bardet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardet:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Thierry Chateau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chateau:Thierry", "Datta Ramadasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramadasan:Datta"], "pages": 8}
