Basically, OONP reads a document and parses it into a predesigned object-oriented data structure (referred to as ontology in this paper) that reflects the domain-specific semantics of the document. An OONP parser models semantic parsing as a decision process: a neural net-based Reader sequentially goes through the document, and during the process it builds and updates an intermediate ontology to summarize its partial understanding of the text it covers. OONP supports a rich family of operations (both symbolic and differentiable) for composing the ontology, and a big variety of forms (both symbolic and differentiable) for representing the state and the document. An OONP parser can be trained with supervision of different forms and strength, including supervised learning (SL) , reinforcement learning (RL) and hybrid of the two. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world document parsing tasks have shown that OONP can learn to handle fairly complicated ontology with training data of modest sizes.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["McGovern Institute for Brain Research", "McGovern Institute for Brain Research"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhengdong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhengdong", "Xianggen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xianggen", "Haotian Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Haotian", "Yukun Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Yukun", "Daqi Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Daqi"], "pages": 10}
