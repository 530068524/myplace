{"title": "CryptDB: protecting confidentiality with encrypted query processing.", "fields": ["exploit", "password", "adversary", "database encryption", "sql"], "abstract": "Online applications are vulnerable to theft of sensitive information because adversaries can exploit software bugs to gain access to private data, and because curious or malicious administrators may capture and leak data. CryptDB is a system that provides practical and provable confidentiality in the face of these attacks for applications backed by SQL databases. It works by  executing SQL queries over encrypted data  using a collection of efficient SQL-aware encryption schemes. CryptDB can also  chain encryption keys to user passwords , so that a data item can be decrypted only by using the password of one of the users with access to that data. As a result, a database administrator never gets access to decrypted data, and even if all servers are compromised, an adversary cannot decrypt the data of any user who is not logged in. An analysis of a trace of 126 million SQL queries from a production MySQL server shows that CryptDB can support operations over encrypted data for 99.5% of the 128,840 columns seen in the trace. Our evaluation shows that CryptDB has low overhead, reducing throughput by 14.5% for phpBB, a web forum application, and by 26% for queries from TPC-C, compared to unmodified MySQL. Chaining encryption keys to user passwords requires 11--13 unique schema annotations to secure more than 20 sensitive fields and 2--7 lines of source code changes for three multi-user web applications.", "citation": "Citations (935)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Raluca A.
