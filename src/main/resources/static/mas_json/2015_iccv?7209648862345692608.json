These descriptors are mainly trajectory-based, measuring sudden changes, temporal synchrony, and repetitiveness. The actionness map can be used to localize actions in a way that is generic across action and agent types. Furthermore, it also groups interacting regions into a useful unit of analysis, which is crucial for recognition of actions involving interactions. We then implement an actionness-driven pooling scheme to improve action recognition performance. Experimental results on three datasets show the advantages of our method on both action detection and action recognition comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ye Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Ye", "Loong-Fah Cheong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheong:Loong=Fah", "An Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran:An"], "pages": 9}
