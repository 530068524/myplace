MAP inference in graphical models is an optimization problem which can be compiled to integer linear programs (ILPs). We describe several advances in translating MAP queries to ILP instances and present the novel meta-algorithm cutting plane aggregation (CPA). CPA exploits local context-specific symmetries and bundles up sets of linear constraints. The resulting counting constraints lead to more compact ILPs and make the symmetry of the ground model more explicit to state-of-the-art ILP solvers. Moreover, ROCKIT parallelizes most parts of the MAP inference pipeline taking advantage of ubiquitous shared-memory multi-core architectures.\n\nWe report on extensive experiments with Markov logic network (MLN) benchmarks showing that ROCKIT outperforms the state-of-the-art systems ALCHEMY, MARKOV THEBEAST, and TUFFY both in terms of efficiency and quality of results.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "departments": ["University of Mannheim", "University of Washington", "University of Mannheim"], "authors": ["Jan Noessner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noessner:Jan", "Mathias Niepert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niepert:Mathias", "Heiner Stuckenschmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stuckenschmidt:Heiner"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
