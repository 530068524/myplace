On one hand, icons exhibit strict adherence to conventional symbols, poses and apparel. On the other hand, there is a great variety in the style of depiction that can be attributed to different schools and periods. This paper proposes an active shape model (ASM) based technique for icon face representation that can be used for style comparison and attribution. For centuries-old icons suffering from loss of paint, cracks and added noise from digitization artifacts, we apply an independent component analysis (ICA) technique to enhance the paintings' original work. The experimental results show that our method can effectively characterize Cypriot icons.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Ritsumeikan University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Ritsumeikan University"], "authors": ["Guifang Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Guifang", "Neela Sawant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sawant:Neela", "James Ze Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:James_Ze", "Dean R.
