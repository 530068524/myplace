We first analyze the state-of-art FF detectors and their effectiveness against the current botnet threat, demonstrating how botmasters can\u2014with their current resources\u2014thwart detection strategies. Based on the realistic assumptions inferred from empirically observed trends, we create formal models for bot decay, online availability, DNS-advertisement strategies and performance, allowing us to demonstrate the effectiveness of different mimicry attacks and evaluate their effects on the overall online availability and capacity of botnets.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Matthew Knysz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knysz:Matthew", "Xin Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu_0001:Xin", "Kang G.
