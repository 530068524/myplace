To mitigate this problem, the notion of Accountable Authority Identity-Based Encryption (A-IBE) was recently introduced by Goyal. Goyal provided constructions to realize the notion of A-IBE only in the white box and weak black box models. However, the security guarantees provided by these models fall short of those required in practice.   In this paper, we resolve the main open question left in Goyal's work by providing a construction of a (fully) black box A-IBE system. Our construction is based on the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption and uses techniques from key policy attribute based encryption.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Vipul Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Vipul", "Steve Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Steve", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit", "Brent Waters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waters:Brent"], "pages": 10}
