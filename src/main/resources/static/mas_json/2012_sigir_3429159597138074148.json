{"title": "When web search fails, searchers become askers: understanding the transition.", "fields": ["information seeking", "question answering", "web search engine", "web search query", "world wide web"], "abstract": "While Web search has become increasingly effective over the last decade, for many users' needs the required answers may be spread across many documents, or may not exist on the Web at all. Yet, many of these needs could be addressed by asking people via popular Community Question Answering (CQA) services, such as Baidu Knows, Quora, or Yahoo! Answers. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale analysis of how searchers become askers. For this, we study the logs of a major web search engine to trace the transformation of a large number of failed searches into questions posted on a popular CQA site. Specifically, we analyze the characteristics of the queries, and of the patterns of search behavior that precede posting a question; the relationship between the content of the attempted queries and of the posted questions; and the subsequent actions the user performs on the CQA site. Our work develops novel insights into searcher intent and behavior that lead to asking questions to the community, providing a foundation for more effective integration of automated web search and social information seeking.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Emory University", "Emory University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Qiaoling Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qiaoling", "Eugene Agichtein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agichtein:Eugene", "Gideon Dror.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dror:Gideon", "Yoelle Maarek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maarek:Yoelle", "Idan Szpektor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szpektor:Idan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
