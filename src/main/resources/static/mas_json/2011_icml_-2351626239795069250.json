{"title": "On Information-Maximization Clustering: Tuning Parameter Selection and Analytic Solution.", "fields": ["kernel", "probabilistic classification", "mutual information", "discrete optimization", "continuous optimization"], "abstract": "Information-maximization clustering learns a probabilistic classifier in an unsupervised manner so that mutual information between feature vectors and cluster assignments is maximized. A notable advantage of this approach is that it only involves continuous optimization of model parameters, which is substantially easier to solve than discrete optimization of cluster assignments. However, existing methods still involve non-convex optimization problems, and therefore finding a good local optimal solution is not straightforward in practice. In this paper, we propose an alternative information-maximization clustering method based on a squared-loss variant of mutual information. This novel approach gives a clustering solution analytically in a computationally efficient way via kernel eigenvalue decomposition. Furthermore, we provide a practical model selection procedure that allows us to objectively optimize tuning parameters included in the kernel function. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi", "Makoto Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Makoto", "Manabu Kimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimura:Manabu", "Hirotaka Hachiya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hachiya:Hirotaka"], "pages": 8}
