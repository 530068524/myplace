{"title": "Occlusion Detection and Motion Estimation with Convex Optimization.", "fields": ["optical flow", "occlusion", "convex optimization", "mathematical optimization", "motion estimation"], "abstract": "We tackle the problem of simultaneously detecting occlusions and estimating optical flow. We show that, under standard assumptions of Lambertian reflection and static illumination, the task can be posed as a convex minimization problem. Therefore, the solution, computed using efficient algorithms, is guaranteed to be globally optimal, for any number of independently moving objects, and any number of occlusion layers. We test the proposed algorithm on benchmark datasets, expanded to enable evaluation of occlusion detection performance.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Alper Ayvaci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ayvaci:Alper", "Michalis Raptis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raptis:Michalis", "Stefano Soatto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soatto:Stefano"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
