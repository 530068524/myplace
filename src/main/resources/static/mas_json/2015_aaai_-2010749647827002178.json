{"title": "Estimating Temporal Dynamics of Human Emotions.", "fields": ["streams", "sentiment analysis", "scientific modelling", "mood", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Sentiment analysis predicts a one-dimensional quantity describing the positive or negative emotion of an author. Mood analysis extends the one-dimensional sentiment response to a multi-dimensional quantity, describing a diverse set of human emotions. In this paper, we extend sentiment and mood analysis temporally and model emotions as a function of time based on temporal streams of blog posts authored by a specific author. The model is useful for constructing predictive models and discovering scientific models of human emotions.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Amazon.com", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Seungyeon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seungyeon", "Joonseok Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joonseok", "Guy Lebanon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lebanon:Guy", "Haesun Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Haesun"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
