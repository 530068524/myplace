With the rapid development of the Web, huge amounts of information are available in the form of Web documents, structures, and links. It has been a dream of the database and Web communities to harvest such information and reconcile the unstructured nature of the Web with the neat, semi-structured schemas of the database paradigm. Taking computer science as a dedicated domain, WINACS first discovers related Web entity structures, and then constructs a heterogeneous computer science information network in order to rank, cluster and analyze this network and support intelligent and analytical queries.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Universita, Bari, Italy"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Tim Weninger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weninger:Tim", "Marina Danilevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danilevsky:Marina", "Fabio Fumarola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fumarola:Fabio", "Joshua M.
