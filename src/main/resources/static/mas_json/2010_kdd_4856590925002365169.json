For our analysis we use a set of diverse state-of-the-art collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms, which include: SVD, Neighborhood Based Approaches, Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Asymmetric Factor Model and Global Effects. We show that linearly combining (blending) a set of CF algorithms increases the accuracy and outperforms any single CF algorithm. Furthermore, we show how to use ensemble methods for blending predictors in order to outperform a single blending algorithm. The dataset and the source code for the ensemble blending are available online.", "citation": "Citations (223)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "commendo resear ... \u00f6flach, Austria", "commendo resear ... \u00f6flach, Austria"], "authors": ["Michael Jahrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jahrer:Michael", "Andreas T\u00f6scher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/T=ouml=scher:Andreas", "Robert A.
