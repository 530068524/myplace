{"title": "Narrow-Bicliques: Cryptanalysis of Full IDEA.", "fields": ["linear cryptanalysis", "cryptanalysis", "differential cryptanalysis", "higher order differential cryptanalysis", "complete bipartite graph"], "abstract": "We apply and extend the recently introduced biclique framework to IDEA and for the first time describe an approach to noticeably speed-up key-recovery for the full 8.5 round IDEA.\n\nWe also show that the biclique approach to block cipher cryptanalysis not only obtains results on more rounds, but also improves time and data complexities over existing attacks. We consider the first 7.5 rounds of IDEA and demonstrate a variant of the approach that works with practical data complexity.\n\nThe conceptual contribution is the narrow-bicliques technique: the recently introduced independent-biclique approach extended with ways to allow for a significantly reduced data complexity with everything else being equal. For this we use available degrees of freedom as known from hash cryptanalysis to narrow the relevant differential trails. Our cryptanalysis is of high computational complexity, and does not threaten the practical use of IDEA in any way, yet the techniques are practically verified to a large extent.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Luxembourg", "DTU, Denmark"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Dmitry Khovratovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khovratovich:Dmitry", "Ga\u00ebtan Leurent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leurent:Ga=euml=tan", "Christian Rechberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rechberger:Christian"], "pages": 19}
