TReMer+ works by first constructing a merged model before checking consistency. This enables a flexible way of verifying global consistency properties that is not possible with other existing tools.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mehrdad Sabetzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabetzadeh:Mehrdad", "Shiva Nejati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nejati:Shiva", "Steve M.
