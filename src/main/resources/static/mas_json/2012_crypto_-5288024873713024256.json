{"title": "Functional Encryption for Regular Languages.", "fields": ["random oracle", "ciphertext", "functional encryption", "deterministic finite automaton", "public key cryptography"], "abstract": "We provide a functional encryption system that supports functionality for regular languages. In our system a secret key is associated with a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) M. A ciphertext \\(\\text {CT}\\) encrypts a message m and is associated with an arbitrary length string w. A user is able to decrypt the ciphertext \\(\\text {CT}\\) if and only if the DFA M associated with his private key accepts the string w.", "citation": "Citations (168)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Brent Waters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waters:Brent"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 18}
