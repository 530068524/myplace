In both cases, previous constructions were only proven to be selectively secure. Both results use novel strategies to adapt the dual system encryption methodology introduced by Waters. We construct our ABE scheme in composite order bilinear groups, and prove its security from three static assumptions. Our ABE scheme supports arbitrary monotone access formulas. Our predicate encryption scheme is constructed via a new approach on bilinear pairings using the notion of dual pairing vector spaces proposed by Okamoto and Takashima.", "citation": "Citations (1,052)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Mitsubishi Electric", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Allison B.
