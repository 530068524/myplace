Despite recent deployments of electronic health records (EHR), paper medical records are still widely used because of the affordances of paper. Although a number of approaches explored the integration of paper and digital technology, there are still a wide range of open issues in the design of technologies that integrate digital and paper-based medical records. This paper studies the use of one such novel technology, called the Hybrid Patient Record (HyPR), that is designed to digitally augment a paper medical record. We report on two studies: a field study in which we describe the benefits and challenges of using a combination of electronic and paper-based medical records in a large university hospital and a deployment study in which we analyze how 8 clinicians used the HyPR in a medical simulation. Based on these empirical studies, this paper introduces and discusses the concept of collaborative affordances, which describes a set of properties of the medical record that foster collaborative collocated work.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Steven Houben.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Houben:Steven", "Mads Frost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frost:Mads", "Jakob E.
