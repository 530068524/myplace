Although several studies have been carried out on this topic, setting an appropriate minimum utility threshold is a difficult problem for users. If  min_util  is set too low, too many high utility itemsets will be generated, which may cause the mining algorithms to become inefficient or even run out of memory. On the other hand, if  min_util  is set too high, no high utility itemset will be found. Setting appropriate minimum utility thresholds by trial and error is a tedious process for users. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a new framework named top-k high utility itemset mining, where k is the desired number of high utility itemsets to be mined. An efficient algorithm named TKU (Top-K Utility itemsets mining) is proposed for mining such itemsets without setting min_util. Several features were designed in  TKU  to solve the new challenges raised in this problem, like the absence of anti-monotone property and the requirement of lossless results. Moreover,  TKU  incorporates several novel strategies for pruning the search space to achieve high efficiency. Results on real and synthetic datasets show that  TKU  has excellent performance and scalability.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "departments": ["National Cheng Kung University", "National Cheng Kung University", "National Cheng Kung University", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Cheng-Wei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Cheng=Wei", "Bai-En Shie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shie:Bai=En", "Vincent S.
