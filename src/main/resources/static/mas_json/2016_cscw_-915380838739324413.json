{"title": "'A Farmer, a Place and at least 20 Members': The Development of Artifact Ecologies in Volunteer-based Communities.", "fields": ["computer supported cooperative work", "appropriation", "citizen journalism", "content analysis", "volunteer"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a case study of an urban organic food community and examine the way the community shapes its artifact ecology through a combination of appropriation of freely or cheaply available tools, and the long-term effort of building the community's own website. Based on participatory observation, content analysis of communication documents, and a series of interviews, we see how the collection of artifacts that a community uses to support their practice form what we refer to as their community artifact ecology. A community artifact ecology is multifaceted, dynamic and pending on what the members bring to the table, as well as on particular situations of use. The community artifact ecology concept is important for CSCW as it enables framing of the relationship between communities and technologies beyond the single artifact and beyond a static view of a dedicated technology.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University"], "authors": ["Susanne B\u00f8dker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=oslash=dker:Susanne", "Henrik Korsgaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korsgaard:Henrik", "Joanna Saad-Sulonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saad=Sulonen:Joanna"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 15}
