Most of them however have following limitations: high computation or communication overhead, no resilience to a large number of node compromises, delayed authentication, lack of scalability, etc. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a novel message authentication approach which adopts a perturbed polynomial-based technique to simultaneously accomplish the goals of lightweight, resilience to a large number of node compromises, immediate authentication, scalability, and non-repudiation. Extensive analysis and experiments have also been conducted to evaluate the scheme in terms of security properties and system overhead.", "citation": "Citations (117)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "New Jersey Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Wensheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Wensheng", "Nalin Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Nalin", "Guiling Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guiling"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
