{"title": "On the Impossibility of Basing Identity Based Encryption on Trapdoor Permutations.", "fields": ["probabilistic encryption", "chosen ciphertext attack", "ciphertext", "trapdoor function", "semantic security"], "abstract": "We ask whether an identity based encryption (IBE) system can be built from simpler public-key primitives. We show that there is no black-box construction of IBE from trapdoor permutations (TDP) or even from chosen ciphertext secure public key encryption (CCA-PKE). These black-box separation results are based on an essential property of IBE, namely that an IBE system is able to compress exponentially many public-keys into a short public parameters string.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Periklis A.
