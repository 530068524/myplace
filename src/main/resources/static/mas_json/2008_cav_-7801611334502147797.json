{"title": "Heap Assumptions on Demand.", "fields": ["binary heap", "counterexample", "binomial heap", "heap", "reachability"], "abstract": "Termination of a heap-manipulating program generally depends on preconditions that express  heap assumptions (i.e., assertions describing reachability, aliasing, separation and sharing in the heap). We present an algorithm for the inference of such preconditions. The algorithm exploits a unique interplay between counterexample-producing abstract termination checker and shape analysis. The shape analysis produces heap assumptions on demand to eliminate counterexamples, i.e., non-terminating abstract computations. The experiments with our prototype implementation indicate its practical potential.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "MPI-SWS,"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Andreas Podelski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podelski:Andreas", "Andrey Rybalchenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rybalchenko:Andrey", "Thomas Wies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wies:Thomas"], "pages": 14}
