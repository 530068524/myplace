This paper develops a family of super-linearly convergent LP solvers based on proximal minimization schemes using Bregman divergences that exploit the underlying graphical structure, and so scale well to large problems. All of our algorithms have a double-loop character, with the outer loop corresponding to the proximal sequence, and an inner loop of cyclic Bregman divergences used to compute each proximal update. The inner loop updates are distributed and respect the graph structure, and thus can be cast as message-passing algorithms. We establish various convergence guarantees for our algorithms, illustrate their performance, and also present rounding schemes with provable optimality guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Pradeep Ravikumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravikumar:Pradeep", "Alekh Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Alekh", "Martin J.
