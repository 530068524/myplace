{"title": "Learning Parametric Sparse Models for Image Super-Resolution.", "fields": ["neural coding", "superresolution", "aliasing", "parametric statistics", "heuristic"], "abstract": "Learning accurate prior knowledge of natural images is of great importance for single image super-resolution (SR). Existing SR methods either learn the prior from the low/high-resolution patch pairs or estimate the prior models from the input low-resolution (LR) image. Specifically, high-frequency details are learned in the former methods. Though effective, they are heuristic and have limitations in dealing with blurred LR images; while the latter suffers from the limitations of frequency aliasing. In this paper, we propose to combine those two lines of ideas for image super-resolution. More specifically, the parametric sparse prior of the desirable high-resolution (HR) image patches are learned from both the input low-resolution (LR) image and a training image dataset. With the learned sparse priors, the sparse codes and thus the HR image patches can be accurately recovered by solving a sparse coding problem. Experimental results show that the proposed SR method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both subjective and objective image qualities.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Xidian University", "Xidian University", "Xidian University", "Xidian University", "West Virginia University"], "authors": ["Yongbo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yongbo", "Weisheng Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Weisheng", "Xuemei Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Xuemei", "Guangming Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Guangming", "Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0005:Xin", "Donglai Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Donglai"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
