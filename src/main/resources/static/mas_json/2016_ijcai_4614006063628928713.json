{"title": "A Decision Procedure for a Fragment of Linear Time Mu-Calculus.", "fields": ["linear temporal logic", "graph", "time complexity", "decision problem", "specification language"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study an expressive fragment, namely G\u00b5, of linear time \u00b5-calculus as a high-level goal specification language. We define Goal Progression Form (GPF) for G\u00b5 formulas and show that every closed formula can be transformed into this form. Based on GPF, we present the notion of Goal Progression Form Graph (GPG) which can be used to describe models of a formula. Further, we propose a simple and intuitive GPG-based decision procedure for checking satisfiability of G\u00b5 formulas which has the same time complexity as the decision problem of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). However, G\u00b5 is able to express a wider variety of temporal goals compared with LTL.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Xidian University", "Xidian University", "Xidian University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yao", "Zhenhua Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Zhenhua", "Cong Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Cong"], "pages": 7}
