Through the introduction of a diffusion-convolution operation, we show how diffusion-based representations can be learned from graph-structured data and used as an effective basis for node classification. DCNNs have several attractive qualities, including a latent representation for graphical data that is invariant under isomorphism, as well as polynomial-time prediction and learning that can be represented as tensor operations and efficiently implemented on a GPU. Through several experiments with real structured datasets, we demonstrate that DCNNs are able to outperform probabilistic relational models and kernel-on-graph methods at relational node classification tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["James Atwood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atwood:James", "Don Towsley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Towsley:Don"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
