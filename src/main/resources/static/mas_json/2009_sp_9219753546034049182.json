We present the first automatic method for information-flow analysis that discovers what information is leaked and computes its comprehensive quantitative interpretation. The leaked information is characterized by an equivalence relation on secret artifacts, and is represented by a logical assertion over the corresponding program variables. Our measurement procedure computes the number of discovered equivalence classes and their sizes. This provides a basis for computing a set of quantitative properties, which includes all established information-theoretic measures in quantitative information-flow. Our method exploits an inherent connection between formal models of qualitative information-flow and program verification techniques. We provide an implementation of our method that builds upon existing tools for program verification and information-theoretic analysis. Our experimental evaluation indicates the practical applicability of the presented method.", "citation": "Citations (200)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Michael Backes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Backes_0001:Michael", "Boris K\u00f6pf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=pf:Boris", "Andrey Rybalchenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rybalchenko:Andrey"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2009", "pages": 13}
