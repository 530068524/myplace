{"title": "Robust image registration and tampering localization exploiting bag of features based forensic signature.", "fields": ["digital image", "communication source", "digital image processing", "feature detection", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "The distribution of digital images with the classic and newest technologies available on Internet (e.g., emails, social networks, digital repositories) has induced a growing interest on systems able to protect the visual content against malicious manipulations that could be performed during their transmission. One of the main problems addressed in this context is the authentication of the image received in a communication. This task is usually performed by localizing the regions of the image which have been tampered. To this aim the received image should be first registered with the one at the sender by exploiting the information provided by a specific component of the forensic hash associated with the image. In this paper we propose a robust alignment method which makes use of an image signature based on the Bag of Features paradigm. The alignment is based on a voting procedure in the parameter space of the model used to recover the geometric transformation occurred into the manipulated image. Experiments show that the proposed approach obtains good margin in terms of performances with respect to state-of-the art methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Catania", "University of Catania", "University of Catania", "University of Catania"], "authors": ["Sebastiano Battiato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Battiato:Sebastiano", "Giovanni Maria Farinella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farinella:Giovanni_Maria", "Enrico Messina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Messina:Enrico", "Giovanni Puglisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Puglisi:Giovanni"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
