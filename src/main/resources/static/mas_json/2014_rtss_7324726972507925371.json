In this paper, we combine AMC with the concept of non-preemptive regions by making the final part of each task's execution at each criticality level non-preemptive. We derive schedulability analysis for this approach, and provide an effective algorithm for choosing each task's priority and the durations of its non-preemptive regions. Evaluations illustrate the benefits of this approach in terms of increased schedulability.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of York", "University of York"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Alan Burns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burns:Alan", "Robert I.
