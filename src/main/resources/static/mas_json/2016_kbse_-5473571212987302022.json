{"title": "Automated testing and notification of mobile app privacy leak-cause behaviours.", "fields": ["android", "humanoid robot", "hybrid testing", "information privacy", "privacy software"], "abstract": "I describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel hybrid static/dynamic analysis system for automatically uncovering and testing for the user-triggered causes and paths of privacy leaks in Android applications (privacy \u2018leak-causes\u2019). I describe how I plan to further evaluate and demonstrate improvements in accuracy, coverage and testing speed of my hybrid testing approach against other currently available systems. I also show how user privacy is improved by the presentation of information on leak-causes in a field study as privacy notices. I present plans to investigate which of the commonly utilized mobile notification mechanisms is best suited to the presentation of leak-causes, as well as how users may set better privacy control policies with the information provided.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Singapore Management University"], "authors": ["Joseph Chan Joo Keng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keng:Joseph_Chan_Joo"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
