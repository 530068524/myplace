We analyze app installs, app usage behavior and notification attendance behavior to paint an initial picture of app overchoice and to explore how overchoice is impacted by smartphone notifications. We hope that this paper will provoke discussions and more research in the UbiTtention community on developing systems that help users navigate the dilemma of overchoice.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Shiv Nadar University", "Bell Labs", "Shiv Nadar University", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Lakshmi Manasa Kalanadhabhatta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalanadhabhatta:Lakshmi_Manasa", "Akhil Mathur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathur:Akhil", "Rahul Majethia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majethia:Rahul", "Fahim Kawsar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawsar:Fahim"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
