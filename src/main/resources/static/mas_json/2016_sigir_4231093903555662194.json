In this paper, we propose an interest drift model (IDM), which monitors the evolution of author interests in time-stamped documents. The model further uses the discovered author interest information to help finding better topics. Unlike traditional topic models, our model is sensitive to the ordering of words, thus it extracts more information from the semantic meaning of the context. The experiment results show that the IDM model learns better topics than state-of-the-art topic models.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Alberta", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Min Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0007:Min", "Jincheng Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Jincheng", "Fei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Fei", "Wenting Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Wenting", "Ziyu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Ziyu"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
