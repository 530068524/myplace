The cornea, which is encasing the iris and pupil, is protected by tear fluid, and thus is a highly reflective surface. Our eyes show a reflection of what we see in our current context. We present an attempt of using corneal imaging to extract contextual information - including objects in the field of view - and the user's attention focus. Our system uses a head-mounted eye-camera, for capturing corneal reflections, connected to a RaspberryPi, to record a humans' current view and estimate his focus of attention. We conducted a 2-day experiment, where we collected data in un-instrumented real-world settings. Based on the analysis of the recordings we illustrate what kind of information can be extracted out of the corneal image reflections and outline the possibilities for in-situ notifications.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["DFKI, Saarbruecken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbruecken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbruecken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbruecken, Germany"], "authors": ["Christian Lander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lander:Christian", "Felix Kosmalla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosmalla:Felix", "Frederik Wiehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiehr:Frederik", "Sven Gehring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehring:Sven"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
