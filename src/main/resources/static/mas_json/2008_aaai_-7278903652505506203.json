Among others, the space complexity of treelike resolution (also called hardness), the minimal size of strong backdoors and of cycle-cutsets, and the treewidth can be used for this purpose.\n\nWe propose the use of the tree-like space complexity as a solid candidate to be the best measure for solvers based on DPLL. To support this thesis we provide a comparison with the other mentioned measures. We also conduct an experimental investigation to show how the proposed measure characterizes the hardness of random and industrial instances.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council", "DIEI, UdL, Lleida, Spain"], "authors": ["Carlos Ans\u00f3tegui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ans=oacute=tegui:Carlos", "Maria Luisa Bonet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonet:Maria_Luisa", "Jordi Levy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levy:Jordi", "Felip Many\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Many=agrave=:Felip"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 7}
