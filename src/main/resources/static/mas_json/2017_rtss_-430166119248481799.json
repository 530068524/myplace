GPC and AND are two fundamental components in RTC, which model priority-based resource arbitration and synchronization operations, respectively. In this paper, we revisit GPC and AND. For GPC, we develop tighter output arrival curves to more precisely characterize the output event streams. For AND, we first identify a problem in the existing analysis method that may lead to negative values in the output curves, and present corrections to the problem. Then we generalize AND to synchronize more than two input event streams. We implement our new theoretical results and conduct experiments to evaluate their performance. Experiment results show significant improvement of our new methods in analysis precision and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Nanyang Technological University", "University of Pennsylvania", "Uppsala University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Yue Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Yue", "Nan Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Nan", "Weichen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Weichen", "Linh Thi Xuan Phan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phan:Linh_Thi_Xuan", "Wang Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi_0001:Wang"], "pages": 11}
