{"title": "Soft Syntactic Constraints for Hierarchical Phrased-Based Translation.", "fields": ["training set", "exploit", "natural language processing", "arabic", "syntax"], "abstract": "In adding syntax to statistical MT, there is a tradeoff between taking advantage of linguistic analysis, versus allowing the model to exploit linguistically unmotivated mappings learned from parallel training data. A number of previous efforts have tackled this tradeoff by starting with a commitment to linguistically motivated analyses and then nding appropriate ways to soften that commitment. We present an approach that explores the tradeoff from the other direction, starting with a context-free translation model learned directly from aligned parallel text, and then adding soft constituent-level constraints based on parses of the source language. We obtain substantial improvements in performance for translation from Chinese and Arabic to English.", "citation": "Citations (143)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yuval Marton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marton:Yuval", "Philip Resnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Resnik:Philip"], "pages": 9}
