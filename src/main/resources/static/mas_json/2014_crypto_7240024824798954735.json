A practical single-key variant of NMAC called HMAC is a very popular and widely deployed message authentication code (MAC). Security proofs and attacks for NMAC can typically be lifted to HMAC.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "authors": ["Peter Gazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gazi:Peter", "Krzysztof Pietrzak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietrzak:Krzysztof", "Michal Ryb\u00e1r.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryb=aacute=r:Michal"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2014", "pages": 18}
