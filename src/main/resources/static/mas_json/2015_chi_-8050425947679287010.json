{"title": "Finding the Adaptive Sweet Spot: Balancing Compliance and Achievement in Automated Stress Reduction.", "fields": ["stress measures", "behavior change", "coaching", "software deployment", "mental health"], "abstract": "Automated coaching systems offer a convenient, cost-effective way to reduce stress, which can be a serious health issue. However, one concern with such systems is compliance; users fail to achieve daily stress reduction goals because goals are too easy or too difficult. To address this, we built DStress (Design for Stress), a theoretically grounded system that sets adaptive goals in three coaching dimensions: Exercise, Meditation and Accessibility. DStress modifies goal-difficulty based on the individual's immediately previous performance. In a 28-day deployment with 65 users, DStress reduced scores on one direct measure of stress almost in half, significantly more than two other non-adaptive coaching strategies. However, on a second direct stress measure, no improvement was found. There were also no improvements on other indirect stress measures. Analysis of 2842 user-generated reports suggests our findings were the result of DStress balancing compliance against the degree of challenge of the goals it would set.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Irvine", "PARC", "PARC"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Artie Konrad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konrad:Artie", "Victoria Bellotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellotti:Victoria", "Nicole Crenshaw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crenshaw:Nicole", "Simon Tucker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tucker:Simon", "Les Nelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nelson:Les", "Honglu Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Honglu", "Peter Pirolli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pirolli:Peter", "Steve Whittaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittaker:Steve"], "pages": 10}
