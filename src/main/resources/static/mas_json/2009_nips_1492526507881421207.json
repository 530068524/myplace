{"title": "Perceptual Multistability as Markov Chain Monte Carlo Inference.", "fields": ["posterior probability", "inference", "markov chain monte carlo", "multistability", "graphical model"], "abstract": "While many perceptual and cognitive phenomena are well described in terms of Bayesian inference, the necessary computations are intractable at the scale of real-world tasks, and it remains unclear how the human mind approximates Bayesian computations algorithmically. We explore the proposal that for some tasks, humans use a form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo to approximate the posterior distribution over hidden variables. As a case study, we show how several phenomena of perceptual multistability can be explained as MCMC inference in simple graphical models for low-level vision.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Samuel Gershman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gershman:Samuel", "Ed Vul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vul:Ed", "Joshua B.
