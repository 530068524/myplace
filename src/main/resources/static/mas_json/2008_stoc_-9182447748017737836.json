In contrast, we show that the problem of finding any (approximate) Nash equilibrium for a three-player infinitely-repeated game is computationally intractable (even when all payoffs are in {-1,0,1}), unless all of PPAD can be solved in randomized polynomial time. This is done by showing that finding Nash equilibria of (k+1)-player infinitely-repeated games is as hard as finding Nash equilibria of k-player one-shot games, for which PPAD-hardness is known (Daskalakis, Goldberg and Papadimitriou, 2006; Chen, Deng and Teng, 2006; Chen, Teng and Valiant, 2007). This also explains why no computationally-efficient learning dynamics, such as the \"no regret\" algorithms, can be \"rational\" (in general games with three or more players) in the sense that, when one's opponents use such a strategy, it is not in general a best reply to follow suit.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Northwestern University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Christian Borgs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borgs:Christian", "Jennifer T.
