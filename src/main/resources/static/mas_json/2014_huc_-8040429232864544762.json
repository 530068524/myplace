In particular, we focus on differentiating between different forms of motorized transport such as car, bus, subway etc. Our approach uses location information and features derived from transit route information (schedule information, not real-time) published by transit agencies. This enables no up-front training or learning of routes and can be deployed instantly to a new place since most transit agencies publish this information. Combined with motion detection using phone accelerometers, we obtain a classification accuracy of around 90% on 50+ hours of car and transit data.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Rahul C.
