{"title": "Hammer Time!: A Low-Cost, High Precision, High Accuracy Tool to Measure the Latency of Touchscreen Devices.", "fields": ["photoelectric sensor", "touchscreen", "hammer", "software design document", "latency"], "abstract": "We report on the Latency Hammer, a low-cost yet highaccuracy and high-precision automated tool that measures the interface latency of touchscreen devices. The Hammer directly measures latency by triggering a capacitive touch event on a device using an electrically actuated touch simulator, and a photo sensor to monitor the screen for a visual response. This allows us to measure the full end-toend latency of a touchscreen system exactly as it would be experienced by a user. The Hammer does not require human interaction to perform a measurement, enabling the acquisition of large datasets. We present the operating principles of the Hammer, and discuss its design and construction; full design documents are available online. We also present a series of tools and equipment that were built to assess and validate the performance of the Hammer, and demonstrate that it provides reliable latency measurements.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Tactual Labs, N ... w York, NY, USA", "Tactual Labs, N ... w York, NY, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jonathan Deber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deber:Jonathan", "Bruno Ara\u00fajo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ara=uacute=jo:Bruno", "Ricardo Jota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jota:Ricardo", "Clifton Forlines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forlines:Clifton", "Darren Leigh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leigh:Darren", "Steven Sanders.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanders:Steven", "Daniel J.
