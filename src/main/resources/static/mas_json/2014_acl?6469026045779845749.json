{"title": "Tagging The Web: Building A Robust Web Tagger with Neural Network.", "fields": ["machine learning", "syntax", "natural language processing", "artificial neural network", "parsing"], "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of web-domain POS tagging using a twophase approach. The first phase learns representations that capture regularities underlying web text. The representation is integrated as features into a neural network that serves as a scorer for an easy-first POS tagger. Parameters of the neural network are trained using guided learning in the second phase. Experiment on the SANCL 2012 shared task show that our approach achieves 93.15% average tagging accuracy, which is the best accuracy reported so far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ji Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Ji", "Yue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yue", "Jingbo Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jingbo"], "pages": 11}
