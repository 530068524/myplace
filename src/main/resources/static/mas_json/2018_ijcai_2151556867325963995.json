{"title": "Dynamic Fair Division Problem with General Valuations.", "fields": ["logarithm", "valuation", "binary logarithm", "adversary", "fair division"], "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on how to dynamically allocate a divisible resource fairly among n players who arrive and depart over time. The players may have general heterogeneous valuations over the resource. It is known that the exact envy-free and proportional allocations may not exist in the dynamic setting [Walsh, 2011]. Thus, we will study to what extent we can guarantee the fairness in the dynamic setting. We first design two algorithms which are O(log n)-proportional and O(n)-envy-free for the setting with general valuations, and by constructing the adversary instances such that all dynamic algorithms must be at least Omega(1)-proportional and Omega(n/log n)-envy-free, we show that the bounds are tight up to a logarithmic factor. Moreover, we introduce the setting where the players' valuations are uniform on the resource but with different demands, which generalize the setting of [Friedman et al., 2015]. We prove an O(log n) upper bound and a tight lower bound for this case.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "University of Melbourne", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Bo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Bo", "Wenyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenyang", "Yingkai Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingkai"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
