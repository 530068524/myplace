{"title": "Social immersive media: pursuing best practices for multi-user interactive camera/projector exhibits.", "fields": ["interactive systems engineering", "immersion", "social computing", "social engagement", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "Based on ten years' experience developing interactive camera/projector systems for public science and culture exhibits, we define a distinct form of augmented reality focused on social interaction: social immersive media. Our work abandons GUI metaphors and builds on the language of cinema, casting users as actors within simulated narrative models. We articulate philosophical goals, design principles, and interaction techniques that create strong emotional responses and social engagement through visceral interaction. We describe approaches to clearly communicate cultural and scientific ideas through the medium. And we demonstrate how practitioners can design interactions that promote specific social behaviors in users.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Sona Research,  ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Scott S.
