In this work, we proposed Dnps, a novel nodes embedding approach for acquiring distributed representations of large-scale dynamic social networks. Dnps is suitable for many types of social networks: dynamic/static, directed/undirected, and weighted/unweighted. Recently, several works of nodes embedding were proposed. However, they were designed for static networks, such as language networks. To address this problem, first, we develop a damping based positive sampling (DpS) algorithm to learn the hierarchical structure of social networks. Then, we devise a local search based DpS algorithm to obtain incremental information of network evolution. Finally, we show Dnps's potentials on future link prediction task for three real-life large-scale dynamic social networks. The results show that Dnps consistently outperforms all baseline methods and exhibits an improvement of 12%, 6%, 4% on Digg, Flickr and YouTube over the second-highest level, respectively. Moreover, Dnps is also scalable. For example, Dnps can speed up the training process in 2 \u223c 36 times compared with benchmarks on Flickr network.
