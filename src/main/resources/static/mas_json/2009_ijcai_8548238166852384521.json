{"title": "Abnormal Activity Recognition Based on HDP-HMM Models.", "fields": ["hierarchical dirichlet process", "markov model", "discriminative model", "generative model", "fisher kernel"], "abstract": "Detecting abnormal activities from sensor readings is an important research problem in activity recognition. A number of different algorithms have been proposed in the past to tackle this problem. Many of the previous state-based approaches suffer from the problem of failing to decide the appropriate number of states, which are difficult to find through a trial-and-error approach, in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an accurate and flexible framework for abnormal activity recognition from sensor readings that involves less human tuning of model parameters. Our approach first applies a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM), which supports an infinite number of states, to automatically find an appropriate number of states. We incorporate a Fisher Kernel into the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) model to filter out the activities that are likely to be normal. Finally, we derive an abnormal activity model from the normal activity models to reduce false positive rate in an unsupervised manner. Our main contribution is that our proposed HDP-HMM models can decide the appropriate number of states automatically, and that by incorporating a Fisher Kernel into the OCSVM model, we can combine the advantages from generative model and discriminative model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using several real-world datasets to test our algorithm's performance.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Nanjing University", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Derek Hao Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Derek_Hao", "Xian-Xing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xian=Xing", "Jie Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Jie", "Vincent Wenchen Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Vincent_Wenchen", "Qiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Qiang"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
