{"title": "Photometric display calibration for embedded MR environments.", "fields": ["color calibration", "ground truth", "augmented reality", "color space", "photometry"], "abstract": "We demonstrate a new technique to minimize photometric differences between the color space of a display, sensor, and the real world, for mixed-reality (MR) systems where the real world is visible near or around a display. In this approach, we use an uncalibrated sensor to capture images of the display showing a series of calibration patterns. Using these images, we precompute a polynomial mapping function describing the continuous color-space transform between the real-world, sensor, and display. This mapping function can be evaluated in real-time to produce images that, when rendered on the embedded display, greatly reduce the color differences between displayed images of a mixed-reality world and the surrounding real-world environment. The color distribution of the resulting displayed images is significantly closer to that of the ground truth real-world scene as perceived through the human eye or other sensors. We demonstrate the impact of this technique when applied to a simple dynamic-geometry mixed-reality application.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["Steven Braeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braeger:Steven", "Yiyan Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Yiyan", "Charles E.
