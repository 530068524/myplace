{"title": "Instruction punning: lightweight instrumentation for x86-64.", "fields": ["jump", "fold", "system call", "overhead", "x86"], "abstract": "Existing techniques for injecting probes into running applications are limited;     they either fail to support probing arbitrary locations, or to support scalable,     rapid toggling of probes. We introduce a new technique on x86-64, called     instruction punning, which allows scalable probes at any instruction. The key     idea is that when we inject a jump instruction, the relative address of the jump     serves simultaneously as data and as an instruction sequence. We show that this     approach achieves probe invocation overheads of only a few dozen cycles, and     probe activation/deactivation costs that are cheaper than a system call, even     when all threads in the system are both invoking probes and toggling them.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indiana University", "Chalmers University of Technology", "Indiana University", "Indiana University"], "authors": ["Buddhika Chamith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chamith:Buddhika", "Bo Joel Svensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svensson:Bo_Joel", "Luke Dalessandro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dalessandro:Luke", "Ryan R.
