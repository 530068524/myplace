In recent times, there have been several research efforts toward devising a variety of techniques to summarize tweets in  Twitter . However, these techniques are either not  personal  ( i.e. , consider only tweets in the timeline of a specific user) or are too expensive to be realized on a mobile device. Given that 80% of active  Twitter  users access the site on mobile devices, in this demonstration we present a lightweight, personalized, on-demand, topic modeling-based tweets summarization engine called TOTEM, designed for such devices. Specifically, TOTEM summarizes most recent tweets on a user's timeline and enables her to visualize and navigate representative topics and associated tweets in a user-friendly tap-and-swipe manner.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Kyoto University"], "authors": ["Jin Yao Chin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chin:Jin_Yao", "Sourav S.
