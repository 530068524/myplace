To address this we introduce Causal Impact Release Analysis for app stores, and our tool, CIRA, that implements this analysis. We mined 38,858 popular Google Play apps, over a period of 12 months. For these apps, we identified 26,339 releases for which there was adequate prior and posterior time series data to facilitate causal impact analysis. We found that 33% of these releases caused a statistically significant change in user ratings. We use our approach to reveal important characteristics that distinguish causal significance in Google Play. To explore the actionability of causal impact analysis, we elicited the opinions of app developers: 56 companies responded, 78% concurred with the causal assessment, of which 33% claimed that their company would consider changing its app release strategy as a result of our findings.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["William Martin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martin:William", "Federica Sarro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarro:Federica", "Mark Harman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harman:Mark"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
