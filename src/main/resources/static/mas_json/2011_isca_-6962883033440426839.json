{"title": "Fighting fire with fire: modeling the datacenter-scale effects of targeted superlattice thermal management.", "fields": ["data center", "active cooling", "thermoelectric cooling", "heat sink", "heat spreader"], "abstract": "Local thermal hot-spots in microprocessors lead to worst-case provisioning of global cooling resources, especially in large-scale systems where cooling power can be 50~100% of IT power. Further, the efficiency of cooling solutions degrade non-linearly with supply temperature. Recent advances in active cooling techniques have shown on-chip thermoelectric coolers (TECs) to be very efficient at selectively eliminating small hot-spots. Applying current to a superlattice TEC-film that is deposited between silicon and the heat spreader results in a Peltier effect, which spreads the heat and lowers the temperature of the hot-spot significantly and improves  chip reliability . In this paper, we propose that hot-spot mitigation using thermoelectric coolers can be used as a  power management mechanism  to allow global coolers to be provisioned for a better worst case temperature leading to substantial savings in cooling power.   In order to quantify the potential power savings from using TECs in data center servers, we present a detailed power model that integrates on-chip dynamic and leakage power sour-ces, heat diffusion through the entire chip, TEC and global cooler efficiencies, and all their mutual interactions. Our multi-scale analysis shows that, for a typical data center, TECs allow global coolers to operate at higher temperatures without degrading chip lifetime, and thus save ~27% cooling power on average while providing the same processor reliability as a data center running at 288K.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Susmit Biswas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biswas:Susmit", "Mohit Tiwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwari:Mohit", "Timothy Sherwood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sherwood:Timothy", "Luke Theogarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theogarajan:Luke", "Frederic T.
