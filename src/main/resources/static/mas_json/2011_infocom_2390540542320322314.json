An efficient consolidation scheme requires that VMs are packed tightly, yet receive resources commensurate with their demands. However, measurements from production data centers show that the network bandwidth demands of VMs are dynamic, making it difficult to characterize the demands by a fixed value and to apply traditional consolidation schemes. In this work, we formulate the VM consolidation into a Stochastic Bin Packing problem and propose an online packing algorithm by which the number of servers required is within equation of the optimum for any \u2208 > 0. The result can be improved to within equation of the optimum in a special case. In addition, we use numerical experiments to evaluate the proposed consolidation algorithm and observe 30% server reduction compared to several benchmark algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (312)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Meng", "Xiaoqiao Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Xiaoqiao", "Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Li"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
