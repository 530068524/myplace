Learning similarities specific to a certain perception task from a set of examples has been shown advantageous in various computer vision and pattern recognition problems. In many important applications, the data that one needs to compare come from different representations or modalities, and the similarity between such data operates on objects that may have different and often incommensurable structure and dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a framework for supervised similarity learning based on embedding the input data from two arbitrary spaces into the Hamming space. The mapping is expressed as a binary classification problem with positive and negative examples, and can be efficiently learned using boosting algorithms. The utility and efficiency of such a generic approach is demonstrated on several challenging applications including cross-representation shape retrieval and alignment of multi-modal medical images.", "citation": "Citations (271)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michael M.
