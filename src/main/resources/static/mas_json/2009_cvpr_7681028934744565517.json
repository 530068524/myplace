Concretely, the corresponding hypergraph matching problem is formulated as the maximization of a multilinear objective function over all permutations of the features. This function is defined by a tensor representing the affinity between feature tuples. It is maximized using a generalization of spectral techniques where a relaxed problem is first solved by a multidimensional power method and the solution is then projected onto the closest assignment matrix. The proposed approach has been implemented, and it is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real data.", "citation": "Citations (380)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "KAIST", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "KAIST", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Olivier Duchenne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duchenne:Olivier", "Francis R.
