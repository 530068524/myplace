{"title": "Manifold Embeddings for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability.", "fields": ["observable", "observability", "manifold", "reinforcement learning", "embedding"], "abstract": "Interesting real-world datasets often exhibit nonlinear, noisy, continuous-valued states that are unexplorable, are poorly described by first principles, and are only partially observable. If partial observability can be overcome, these constraints suggest the use of model-based reinforcement learning. We experiment with manifold embeddings to reconstruct the observable state-space in the context of offline, model-based reinforcement learning. We demonstrate that the embedding of a system can change as a result of learning, and we argue that the best performing embeddings well-represent the dynamics of both the uncontrolled and adaptively controlled system. We apply this approach to learn a neurostimulation policy that suppresses epileptic seizures on animal brain slices.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Keith Bush.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bush:Keith", "Joelle Pineau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pineau:Joelle"], "pages": 9}
