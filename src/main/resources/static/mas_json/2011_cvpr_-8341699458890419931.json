We designed a track-linking framework for reasoning about short-term and long-term occlusions. We introduce a two-stage network-flow process to automatically construct a \u201ctrack graph\u201d that describes the track merging and splitting events caused by occlusion. To explain short-term occlusions, when local information is sufficient to distinguish objects, the process links trajectory segments through a series of optimal bipartite-graph matches. To resolve long-term occlusions, when global information is needed to characterize objects, the linking process computes a logarithmic approximation solution to the set cover problem. If multiple views are available, our method builds a track graph, independently for each view, and then simultaneously links track segments from each graph, solving a joint set cover problem for which a logarithmic approximation also exists. Through experiments on different datasets, we show that our proposed linear and integer optimization techniques make the track graph a particularly useful tool for tracking large groups of individuals in images.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Boston University", "Boston University", "Boston University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zheng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Zheng", "Thomas H.
