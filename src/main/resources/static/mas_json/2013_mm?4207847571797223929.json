Some new musical interfaces make use of gestures to control music in a meaningful and intuitive way. A typical approach is to use the orchestra conducting paradigm, in which the computer that generates the music would be a \\textit{virtual orchestra} conducted by the user. However, although conductors' gestures are complex and their meaning can vary depending on the musical context, this context-dependency is still to explore. We propose a method to study context-dependency of body and facial gestures of conductors in orchestral classical music based on temporal clustering of gestures into actions, followed by an analysis of the evolution of audio features after action occurrences. For this, multi-modal data (audio, video, motion capture) will be recorded in real live concerts and rehearsals situations using unobtrusive techniques.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Escola Superior ... arcelona, Spain"], "authors": ["\u00c1lvaro Saras\u00faa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saras=uacute=a:=Aacute=lvaro"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
