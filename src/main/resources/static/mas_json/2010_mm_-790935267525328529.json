The key novelty is the crowdsourcing mechanism, which relies on online users to improve, extend, and share, automatically detected results in video fragments using an advanced timeline-based video player. The user-feedback serves as valuable input to further improve automated multimedia retrieval results, such as automatically detected concepts and automatically transcribed interviews. The search engine has been operational online to harvest valuable feedback from rock n' roll enthusiasts.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision", "University of Twente", "Video Dock, Ams ... am, Netherlands"], "authors": ["Cees G.
