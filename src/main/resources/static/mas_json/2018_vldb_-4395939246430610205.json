{"title": "A Comparative Study on Streaming Frameworks for Big Data.", "fields": ["computer science", "data processing", "big data", "streaming data", "data mining"], "abstract": "Recently, increasingly large amounts of data are generated from a variety of sources. Existing data processing technologies are not suitable to cope with the huge amounts of generated data. Yet, many research works focus on streaming in Big Data, a task referring to the processing of massive volumes of structured/unstructured streaming data. Recently proposed streaming frameworks for Big Data applications help to store, analyze and process the continuously captured data. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of Big Data and we survey existing streaming frameworks for Big Data. We also present an experimental evaluation and a comparative study of the most popular streaming platforms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tunis University", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Jendouba", "Tunis University", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Wissem Inoubli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inoubli:Wissem", "Sabeur Aridhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aridhi:Sabeur", "Haithem Mezni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mezni:Haithem", "Mondher Maddouri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maddouri:Mondher", "Engelbert Mephu Nguifo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguifo:Engelbert_Mephu"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
