Fibred 2-categories correspond to 2-functors from a 2-category into 2Cat. Fibred bicategories correspond to trihomomorphisms from a bicategory into Bicat. We describe the Grothendieck construction for each kind of fibration and present a few examples of each. Fibrations in our sense, between bicategories, are closed under composition and are stable under  equiv-comma . The free such fibration on a homomorphism is obtained by taking an  oplax comma  along an identity.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Macquarie University", "Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences"], "authors": ["Taichi Uemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uemura:Taichi"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
