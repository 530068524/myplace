{"title": "Romantic partnerships and the dispersion of social ties: a network analysis of relationship status on facebook.", "fields": ["romance", "interpersonal ties", "social psychology", "network analysis", "social network"], "abstract": "A crucial task in the analysis of on-line social-networking systems is to identify important people --- those linked by strong social ties --- within an individual's network neighborhood. Here we investigate this question for a particular category of strong ties, those involving spouses or romantic partners. We organize our analysis around a basic question: given all the connections among a person's friends, can you recognize his or her romantic partner from the network structure alone? Using data from a large sample of Facebook users, we find that this task can be accomplished with high accuracy, but doing so requires the development of a new measure of tie strength that we term `dispersion' --- the extent to which two people's mutual friends are not themselves well-connected. The results offer methods for identifying types of structurally significant people in on-line applications, and suggest a potential expansion of existing theories of tie strength.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "departments": ["Facebook", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Lars Backstrom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Backstrom:Lars", "Jon M.
