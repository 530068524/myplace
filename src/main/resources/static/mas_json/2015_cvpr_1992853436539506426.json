Firstly, we evaluate state-of-the-art instance search methods on this problem. We observe that what works for buildings loses its generality on shoes. Secondly, we propose to use automatically learned category-specific attributes to address the large appearance variations present in generic instance search. On the problem of searching among instances from the same category as the query, the category-specific attributes outperform existing approaches by a large margin. On a shoe dataset containing 6624 shoe images recorded from all viewing angles, we improve the performance from 36.73 to 56.56 using category-specific attributes. Thirdly, we extend our methods to search objects without restricting to the specifically known category. We show the combination of category-level information and the category-specific attributes is superior to combining category-level information with low-level features such as Fisher vector.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "Columbia University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ran Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Ran", "Arnold W.
