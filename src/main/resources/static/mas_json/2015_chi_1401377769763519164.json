{"title": "The Proper Care and Feeding of Hackerspaces: Care Ethics and Cultures of Making.", "fields": ["negotiation", "interpersonal communication", "ethos", "ethnography", "neoliberalism"], "abstract": "Communities of making have been at the center of attention in popular, business, political, and academic research circles in recent years. In HCI, they seem to carry the promise of new forms of computer use, education, innovation, and even ways of life. In the West in particular, the maker manifestos of these communities have shown strong elements of a neoliberal ethos, one that prizes self-determination, tech-savvy, independence, freedom from government, suspicion of authority, and so forth. Yet such communities, to function as communities, also require values of collaboration, cooperation, interpersonal support-in a word, care. In this ethnographic study, we studied and participated as members of a hackerspace for 19 months, focusing in particular not on their technical achievements, innovations, or for glimmers of a more sustainable future, but rather to make visible and to analyze the community maintenance labor that helps the hackerspace support the practices that its members, society, and HCI research are so interested in. We found that the maker ethic entails a complex negotiation of both a neoliberal libertarian ethos and a care ethos.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Austin L.
