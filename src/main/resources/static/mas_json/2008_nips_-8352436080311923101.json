{"title": "Finding Latent Causes in Causal Networks: an Efficient Approach Based on Markov Blankets.", "fields": ["graph", "quadratic equation", "markov chain", "causal inference", "graphical model"], "abstract": "Causal structure-discovery techniques usually assume that all causes of more than one variable are observed. This is the so-called causal sufficiency assumption. In practice, it is untestable, and often violated. In this paper, we present an efficient causal structure-learning algorithm, suited for causally insufficient data. Similar to algorithms such as IC* and FCI, the proposed approach drops the causal sufficiency assumption and learns a structure that indicates (potential) latent causes for pairs of observed variables. Assuming a constant local density of the data-generating graph, our algorithm makes a quadratic number of conditional-independence tests w.r.t. the number of variables. We show with experiments that our algorithm is comparable to the state-of-the-art FCI algorithm in accuracy, while being several orders of magnitude faster on large problems. We conclude that MBCS* makes a new range of causally insufficient problems computationally tractable.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "IBM"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jean-Philippe Pellet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pellet:Jean=Philippe", "Andr\u00e9 Elisseeff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elisseeff:Andr=eacute="], "pages": 8}
