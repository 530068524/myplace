However, many applications involve finding the  k  nearest neighbors ( k -NN), where the  k -NN distances of different query points may differ greatly and the performance of LSH suffers. We propose a novel indexing scheme called  Selective Hashing , where a disjoint set of indices are built with different granularities and each point is only stored in the most effective index. Theoretically, we show that  k -NN search using selective hashing can achieve the same recall as a fixed radius LSH search, using a radius equal to the distance of the  c  1  k   th   nearest neighbor, with at most  c  2  times overhead, where  c  1  and  c  2  are small constants. Selective hashing is also easy to build and update, and outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms such as DSH and IsoHash.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "University of Michigan", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Jinyang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jinyang", "H.
