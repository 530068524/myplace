We also discuss prevalent patterns of data polymorphism in Linux, including code patterns we can handle and those we cannot.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "sigsoft", "authors": ["Brian Hackett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hackett:Brian", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex"], "pages": 11}
