This allows allocation of computational resources to promising candidates, however, such decisions are non-differentiable. As a result, these algorithms are hard to train in an end-to-end fashion. In this work we propose to learn an efficient algorithm for the task of 6D object pose estimation. Our system optimizes the parameters of an existing state-of-the art pose estimation system using reinforcement learning, where the pose estimation system now becomes the stochastic policy, parametrized by a CNN. Additionally, we present an efficient training algorithm that dramatically reduces computation time. We show empirically that our learned pose estimation procedure makes better use of limited resources and improves upon the state-of-the-art on a challenging dataset. Our approach enables differentiable end-to-end training of complex algorithmic pipelines and learns to make optimal use of a given computational budget.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Microsoft", "Dresden University of Technology", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Alexander Krull.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krull:Alexander", "Eric Brachmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brachmann:Eric", "Sebastian Nowozin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nowozin:Sebastian", "Frank Michel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michel:Frank", "Jamie Shotton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shotton:Jamie", "Carsten Rother.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rother:Carsten"], "pages": 9}
