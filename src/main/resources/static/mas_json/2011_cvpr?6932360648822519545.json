It is difficult how to appropriately measure the similarity between human faces under significantly different settings (e.g., pose, illumination, and expression). In this paper, we propose a new model, called \u201cAssociate-Predict\u201d (AP) model, to address this issue. The associate-predict model is built on an extra generic identity data set, in which each identity contains multiple images with large intra-personal variation. When considering two faces under significantly different settings (e.g., non-frontal and frontal), we first \u201cassociate\u201d one input face with alike identities from the generic identity date set. Using the associated faces, we generatively \u201cpredict\u201d the appearance of one input face under the setting of another input face, or discriminatively \u201cpredict\u201d the likelihood whether two input faces are from the same person or not. We call the two proposed prediction methods as \u201cappearance-prediction\u201d and \u201clikelihood-prediction\u201d. By leveraging an extra data set (\u201cmemory\u201d) and the \u201cassociate-predict\u201d model, the intra-personal variation can be effectively handled. To improve the generalization ability of our model, we further add a switching mechanism \u2014 we directly compare the appearances of two faces if they have close intra-personal settings; otherwise, we use the associate-predict model for the recognition. Experiments on two public face benchmarks (Multi-PIE and LFW) demonstrated that our final model can substantially improve the performance of most existing face recognition methods", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Qi Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Qi", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian"], "pages": 8}
