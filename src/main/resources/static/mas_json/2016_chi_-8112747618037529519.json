Archive of Our Own (AO3), a fan fiction archive with nearly 750,000 users and over 2 million individual works, was designed and coded primarily by women to meet the needs of the online fandom community. Their design decisions were informed by existing values and norms around issues such as accessibility, inclusivity, and identity. We conducted interviews with 28 users and developers, and with this data we detail the history and design of AO3 using the framework of feminist HCI and focusing on the successful incorporation of values into design. We conclude with considering examples of complexity in values in design work: the use of design to mitigate tensions in values and to influence value formation or change.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "College of Charleston", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Casey Fiesler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiesler:Casey", "Shannon Morrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morrison:Shannon", "Amy S.
