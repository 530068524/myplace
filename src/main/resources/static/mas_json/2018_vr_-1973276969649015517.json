{"title": "Teacher-Guided Educational VR: Assessment of Live and Prerecorded Teachers Guiding Virtual Field Trips.", "fields": ["trips architecture", "test score", "graphics", "field trip", "inclusion"], "abstract": "We present a VR field trip framework, Kvasir-VR, and assess its two approaches to teacher-guided content. In one approach, networked student groups are guided by a live teacher captured as live-streamed depth camera imagery. The second approach is a standalone (non-networked) version allowing students to individually experience the field trip based on depth camera recordings of the same teacher. Both approaches were tested at two high schools using a VR environment that teaches students about solar energy production via tours of a solar plant. We show that our live networked approach can produce promising test score gains and very high ratings of co-presence, affective attraction, overall opinion, etc. Results show a benefit of live networked VR, as the standalone approach had lower performance in terms of gains and most ratings, although its ratings were still positive. We further consider possible differences of school environment (dedicated vs. integrated classroom), and we conclude with tradeoffs and implications to benefit future design of educational VR.
