{"title": "On the Content Security Policy Violations due to the Same-Origin Policy.", "fields": ["content security policy", "same origin policy", "web application security", "network security policy", "implementation"], "abstract": "Modern browsers implement different security policies such as the Content Security Policy (CSP), a mechanism designed to mitigate popular web vulnerabilities, and the Same Origin Policy (SOP), a mechanism that governs interactions between resources of web pages.\n\nIn this work, we describe how CSP may be violated due to the SOP when a page contains an embedded iframe from the same origin. We analyse 1 million pages from 10,000 top Alexa sites and report that at least 31.1% of current CSP-enabled pages are potentially vulnerable to CSP violations. Further considering real-world situations where those pages are involved in same-origin nested browsing contexts, we found that in at least 23.5% of the cases, CSP violations are possible.\n\nDuring our study, we also identified a divergence among browsers implementations in the enforcement of CSP in srcdoc sandboxed iframes, which actually reveals a problem in Gecko-based browsers CSP implementation. To ameliorate the problematic conflicts of the security mechanisms, we discuss measures to avoid CSP violations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Doli\u00e8re Francis Som\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Som=eacute=:Doli=egrave=re_Francis", "Nataliia Bielova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bielova:Nataliia", "Tamara Rezk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezk:Tamara"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
