Newton-CG methods are a variant of Newton method for high-dimensional problems. They only require the Hessian-vector products instead of the full Hessian matrices.\n\nTo speed up Newton-CG methods for the CRF learning, we derive a novel dynamic programming procedure for the Hessian-vector products of the CRF objective function. The proposed procedure can reuse the byproducts of the time-consuming gradient computation for the Hessian-vector products to drastically reduce the total computation time of the Newton-CG methods.\n\nIn experiments with tasks in natural language processing, the proposed method outperforms a conventional quasi-Newton method. Remarkably, the proposed method is competitive with online learning algorithms that are fast but unstable.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["IBM", "University of Tokyo", "Tohoku University", "Preferred Infra ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Yuta Tsuboi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsuboi:Yuta", "Yuya Unno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unno:Yuya", "Hisashi Kashima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kashima:Hisashi", "Naoaki Okazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okazaki:Naoaki"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
