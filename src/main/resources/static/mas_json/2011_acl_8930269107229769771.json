{"title": "Confidence Driven Unsupervised Semantic Parsing.", "fields": ["training set", "bottleneck", "natural language processing", "unsupervised learning", "parsing"], "abstract": "Current approaches for semantic parsing take a supervised approach requiring a considerable amount of training data which is expensive and difficult to obtain. This supervision bottleneck is one of the major difficulties in scaling up semantic parsing.\n\nWe argue that a semantic parser can be trained effectively without annotated data, and introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm. The algorithm takes a self training approach driven by confidence estimation. Evaluated over Geoquery, a standard dataset for this task, our system achieved 66% accuracy, compared to 80% of its fully supervised counterpart, demonstrating the promise of unsupervised approaches for this task.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Dan Goldwasser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldwasser:Dan", "Roi Reichart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reichart:Roi", "James Clarke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clarke:James", "Dan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Dan"], "pages": 10}
