{"title": "The Complexity of Manipulative Attacks in Nearly Single-Peaked Electorates (Extended Abstract).", "fields": ["mathematics", "time complexity", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Many electoral control and manipulation problems\u2014which we will refer to in general as \u201cmanipulative actions\u201d problems\u2014are NP-hard in the general case. Many of these problems fall into polynomial time if the electorate is singlepeaked, i.e., is polarized along some axis/issue. However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked\u2014for example, there may be some maverick voters\u2014and to take this into account, we study the complexity of manipulative-action algorithms for the case of nearly single-peaked electorates.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["AGH University of Science and Technology", "Rochester Institute of Technology", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Piotr Faliszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faliszewski:Piotr", "Edith Hemaspaandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hemaspaandra:Edith", "Lane A.
