It can be inflated up to the volume of a familiar mouse, but be deflated and stored flat in a PC card slot of a laptop computer when not in use. Inflatable Mouse functions just like a typical mouse; moreover, it provides new interaction techniques by sensing the air pressure in the balloon of the mouse. It also addresses some issues associated with pressure-sensing interactions such as the lack of bi-directional input and the lack of effective feedback. Moreover, it can be used as both a control tool and a display tool. In this paper, the design of an Inflatable Mouse prototype is described and potential application scenarios such as zooming in/out and fast scrolling using pressure control are explained. We also discuss the potential use of Inflatable Mouse as an emotional communication tool.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Seoktae Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seoktae", "Hyunjung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyunjung", "Boram Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Boram", "Tek-Jin Nam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nam:Tek=Jin", "Woohun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Woohun"], "pages": 14}
