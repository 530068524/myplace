PLUS implements a novel lazy position update mechanism that significantly reduces the communication overhead and server indexing load related to frequent location updates in moving object and moving query scenarios. The contribution of this demo is to present how the lazy position update scheme can achieve message-efficiency under various conditions which can be interactively set via user-selectable parameters in a graphical user interface.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "National University of Singapore", "Auburn University", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Yu-Ling Hsueh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsueh:Yu=Ling", "Roger Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann:Roger", "Wei-Shinn Ku.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ku:Wei=Shinn", "Haojun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haojun", "Chung-Dau Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chung=Dau"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
