{"title": "I Would Like To..., I Shouldn't..., I Wish I...: Exploring Behavior-Change Goals for Social Networking Sites.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "wish", "computer science", "social network", "behavior change"], "abstract": "Despite benefits and uses of social networking sites (SNSs) users are not always satisfied with their behaviors on the sites. These desires for behavior change both provide insight into users' perceptions of how SNSs impact their lives (positively or negatively) and can inform tools for helping users achieve desired behavior changes. We use a 604-participant online survey to explore SNS users' behavior-change goals for Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. While some participants want to reduce site use, others want to improve their use or increase a range of behaviors. These desired changes differ by SNS, and, for Twitter, by participants' levels of site use. Participants also expect a range of benefits from these goals, including increased time, contact with others, intrinsic benefits, better security/privacy, and improved self presentation. Based on these results we provide insights both into how participants perceive different SNSs, as well as potential designs for behavior-change mechanisms to target SNS behaviors.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of New Mexico", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Manya Sleeper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sleeper:Manya", "Alessandro Acquisti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acquisti:Alessandro", "Lorrie Faith Cranor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cranor:Lorrie_Faith", "Patrick Gage Kelley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelley:Patrick_Gage", "Sean A.
