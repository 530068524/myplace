{"title": "Atomic Lambda Calculus: A Typed Lambda-Calculus with Explicit Sharing.", "fields": ["graph reduction", "curry", "deep inference", "typed lambda calculus", "denotational semantics"], "abstract": "An explicit -- sharing lambda-calculus is presented, based on a Curry -- Howard-style interpretation of the deep inference proof formalism. Duplication of subterms during reduction proceeds 'atomically', i.e. on individual constructors, similar to optimal graph reduction in the style of Lamping. The calculus preserves strong normalisation with respect to the lambdacalculus, and achieves fully lazy sharing.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Bath", "Univ.
