In this work, we propose a fully automated and robust approach to extract corpus callosum from T1-weighted structural MR images. The novelty of our method is composed of two key steps. In the first step, we find an initial guess for the curve representation of CC by using the zero level set of the first nontrivial Laplace-Beltrami (LB) eigenfunction on the white matter surface. In the second step, the initial curve is deformed toward the final solution with a geodesic curvature flow on the white matter surface. For numerical solution of the geodesic curvature flow on surfaces, we represent the contour implicitly on a triangular mesh and develop efficient numerical schemes based on finite element method. Because our method depends only on the intrinsic geometry of the white matter surface, it is robust to orientation differences of the brain across population. In our experiments, we validate the proposed algorithm on 32 brains from a clinical study of multiple sclerosis disease and demonstrate that the accuracy of our results.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Cedars-Sinai Medical Center", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Department of M ...
