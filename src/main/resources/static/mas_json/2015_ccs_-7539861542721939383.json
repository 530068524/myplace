Its efficiency is in part achieved through a large set of primitive, optimized SMC protocols that it makes available to applications built on its top. The size of this set has brought with it an issue not present in frameworks with a small number of supported operations: the set of protocols must be maintained, as new protocols are still added to it and possible optimizations for a particular sub-protocol should be propagated into larger protocols working with data of different types.   To ease the maintenance of existing and implementation of new protocols, we have devised a domain-specific language (DSL) and its optimizing compiler for specifying protocols for secure computation. In this paper, we give the rationale of the design, describe the translation steps, the location of the compiler in the whole Sharemind protocol stack, and the results obtained with this system.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Cybernetica", "Cybernetica"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Peeter Laud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laud:Peeter", "Jaak Randmets.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Randmets:Jaak"], "pages": 12}
