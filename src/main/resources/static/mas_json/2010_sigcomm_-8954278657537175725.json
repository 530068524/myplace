Delivering scalable bandwidth among such containers is a challenge. A number of recent efforts promise full bisection bandwidth between all servers, though with significant cost, complexity, and power consumption. We present Helios, a hybrid electrical/optical switch architecture that can deliver significant reductions in the number of switching elements, cabling, cost, and power consumption relative to recently proposed data center network architectures. We explore architectural trade offs and challenges associated with realizing these benefits through the evaluation of a fully functional Helios prototype.", "citation": "Citations (815)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Nathan Farrington.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farrington:Nathan", "George Porter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porter:George", "Sivasankar Radhakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radhakrishnan:Sivasankar", "Hamid Hajabdolali Bazzaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bazzaz:Hamid_Hajabdolali", "Vikram Subramanya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanya:Vikram", "Yeshaiahu Fainman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fainman:Yeshaiahu", "George Papen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papen:George", "Amin Vahdat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vahdat:Amin"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
