{"title": "Taking data exposure into account: how does it affect the choice of sign-in accounts?", "fields": ["federated identity", "login", "internet privacy", "computer science", "data mining"], "abstract": "Online services collect personal data from their users, sometimes with no clear need. We studied how users sign-in to web sites using federated IDs, and found that most survey respondents were not aware of the data they expose. However, when presented with the tradeoffs behind each sign-in option, respondents reported a willingness to change how they sign-in to reduce their data exposure or, in fewer cases, to increase it to receive more benefits from the service. Our findings suggest that data exposure is a concern for users, and that there is a need for finding clearer ways for communicating it for each sign-in option.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "University of California, Berkeley", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Shahar Ronen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ronen:Shahar", "Oriana Riva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riva:Oriana", "Maritza Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Maritza", "Donald Thompson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thompson:Donald"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
