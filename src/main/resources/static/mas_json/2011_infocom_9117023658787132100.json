In this paper, we design sampling algorithms that allow us to estimate the global frequency of any item with a standard deviation of eN, where N denotes the total cardinality of all these multisets. Our algorithms have a communication cost of O(n +\u221an/e), which is never worse than the O(n + 1/e 2 ) cost of uniform sampling, and could be much better when n \u226a 1/e 2 . In addition, we prove that one version of our algorithm is instance-optimal in a fairly general sampling framework. We also design algorithms that achieve optimality on the bit level, by combining Bloom filters of various granularities. Finally, we present some simulation results comparing our algorithms with previous techniques. Other than the performance improvement, our algorithms are also much simpler and easily implementable in a large-scale distributed system.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Zengfeng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zengfeng", "Ke Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Ke", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Guihai Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Guihai"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
