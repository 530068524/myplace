{"title": "HomeProxy: exploring a physical proxy for video communication in the home.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "user experience design", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "HomeProxy is a research prototype that explores supporting video communication in the home among distributed family members through a physical proxy. It leverages a physical artifact dedicated to representing remote family members to make it easier to share activities with them. HomeProxy combines a form factor designed for the home environment with a \"no-touch\" user experience and an interface that responsively transitions between recorded and live video messages. We designed and implemented a prototype and conducted a pilot study with eight pairs of users. Our study demonstrated the challenges of a no-touch interface and the promise of offering quick video messaging in the home.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["John C.
