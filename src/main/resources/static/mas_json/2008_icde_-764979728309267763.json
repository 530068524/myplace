{"title": "PictureBook: A Text-and-Image Summary System for Web Search Result.", "fields": ["web modeling", "semantic search", "web search query", "social semantic web", "web mapping"], "abstract": "Search engine technology plays an important role in Web information retrieval. However, with Internet information explosion, traditional searching techniques cannot provide satisfactory result due to problems such as huge number of result Web pages, unintuitive ranking, etc. Therefore, the reorganization and post-processing of Web search results have been extensively studied to help user effectively obtain useful information. Previous studies mainly focused on Web page clustering, document summary, visualization of search results, etc, which are applied separately to either text or image search. In this paper, we propose a demo to illustrate a new Web search result summary system - PictureBook, which combines text and image retrieval using techniques of multiple document summarization and image semantics analysis. Particularly, audience can interactively investigate the effect of the combined text and image summary in Web information searching and knowledge acquisition. We also introduce our new image semantic analysis method based on generalized discriminant analysis (GDA).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Mei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Mei", "Hongtao Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Hongtao", "Guoyu Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Guoyu", "Xiangdong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiangdong", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0009:Wei", "Qi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qi", "Baile Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Baile"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
