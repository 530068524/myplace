Applying sequence alignment techniques on 5 years of geotagged Flickr photos in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) allowed creating walkable city routes based on paths traversed by multiple photographers (or photographer paths). To evaluate our approach, we conducted a user study with Amsterdam residents to compare our routes with the most efficient and popular route variations. Drawing on experience questionnaire data, web survey responses, and user interviews, our results show that our photographer paths were perceived as most stimulating and suitable for city exploration. Moreover, while digital aids based on photographer paths can potentially aid city exploration, their acceptance in mainstream route planners likely depends on their visualization. From our proof-of-concept approach and user study findings, we discuss the potential of data-driven exploration-based city route planners.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Abdallah El Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Abdallah_El", "Sicco N.
