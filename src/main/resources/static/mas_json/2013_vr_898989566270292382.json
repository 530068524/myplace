Latest trends in mobile communications as well as the entertainment industry seem to validate that, accessibility and scalability play an important role in democratizing technology. We present a practical design of such a system that offers the core affordances of immersive virtual reality in a portable and untethered configuration. In addition, we have developed an extensive immersive virtual experience that involves engaging users visually and aurally. This is an effort towards integrating VR into the space and time of user workflows.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Georgia", "University of Georgia", "University of Georgia", "University of Georgia"], "authors": ["Aryabrata Basu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basu:Aryabrata", "Kyle Johnsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnsen:Kyle", "Kenneth Bogert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogert:Kenneth", "Peter Wins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wins:Peter"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
