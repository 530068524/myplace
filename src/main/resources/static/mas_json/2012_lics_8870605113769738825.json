{"title": "Where First-Order and Monadic Second-Order Logic Coincide.", "fields": ["graph property", "monadic predicate calculus", "tree depth", "fair computational tree logic", "zeroth order logic", "treewidth", "clique width", "predicate functor logic"], "abstract": "We study on which classes of graphs first-order logic (FO) and monadic second-order logic (MSO) have the same expressive power. We show that for each class of graphs that is closed under taking subgraphs, FO and MSO have the same expressive power on the class if, and only if, it has bounded tree depth. Tree depth is a graph invariant that measures the similarity of a graph to a star in a similar way that tree width measures the similarity of a graph to a tree. For classes just closed under taking induced subgraphs, we show an analogous result for guarded second-order logic (GSO), the variant of MSO that not only allows quantification over vertex sets but also over edge sets. A key tool in our proof is a Feferman-Vaught-type theorem that is constructive and still works for unbounded partitions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Humboldt State University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "Inst. fur Theor ...
