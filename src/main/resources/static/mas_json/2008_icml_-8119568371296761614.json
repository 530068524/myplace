We describe a solver for Support Vector Machine training running on a GPU, using the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm and an adaptive first and second order working set selection heuristic, which achieves speedups of 9-35x over LIBSVM running on a traditional processor. We also present a GPU-based system for SVM classification which achieves speedups of 81-138x over LIBSVM (5-24x over our own CPU based SVM classifier).", "citation": "Citations (425)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Bryan Catanzaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catanzaro:Bryan", "Narayanan Sundaram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundaram:Narayanan", "Kurt Keutzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keutzer:Kurt"], "pages": 8}
