There is a need therefore, to move from the current model in which high performance applications explicitly and programmatically select the GPU devices on which to run, to a dynamic model where GPUs are treated as first class schedulable entities. The  Strings  scheduler realizes this vision by decomposing the GPU scheduling problem into a combination of load balancing and per-device scheduling. (i) Device-level scheduling efficiently uses all of a GPU's hardware resources, including its computational and data movement engines, and (ii) load balancing goes beyond obtaining high throughput, to ensure fairness through prioritizing GPU requests that have attained least service. With its methods, Strings achieves improvements in system throughput and fairness of up to 8.70x and 13%, respectively, compared to the CUDA runtime.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Dipanjan Sengupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sengupta:Dipanjan", "Anshuman Goswami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goswami:Anshuman", "Karsten Schwan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwan:Karsten", "Krishna Pallavi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pallavi:Krishna"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
