Ad networks today, sadly, rely primarily on security through obscurity to defend against click-spam. In this paper, we present Viceroi, a principled approach to catching click-spam in search ad networks. It is designed based on the intuition that click-spam is a profit-making business that needs to deliver higher return on investment (ROI) for click-spammers than other (ethical) business models to offset the risk of getting caught. Viceroi operates at the ad network where it has visibility into all ad clicks. Working with a large real-world ad network, we find that the simple-yet-general Viceroi approach catches over six very different classes of click-spam attacks (e.g., malware-driven, search-hijacking, arbitrage) without any tuning knobs.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Microsoft", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Vacha Dave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dave:Vacha", "Saikat Guha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guha:Saikat", "Yin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Yin"], "pages": 12}
