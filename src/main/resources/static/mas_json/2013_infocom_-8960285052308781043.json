We approach this broad question in the framework of percolation theory. To this end, we assume an elementary mobility model, where nodes arrive to an infinite plane according to a Poisson point process, move a certain distance l, and then depart. In this setting, we characterize the mean density of nodes required to support DTN style networking. Under the given assumptions, we show that DTN communication is feasible when the mean node degree \u03bd is greater than 4 \u00b7 \u03b7 c (\u03b3), where parameter \u03b3= l/d is the ratio of the distance l to the transmission range d, and \u03b7 c (\u03b3) is the critical reduced number density of tilted cylinders in a directed continuum percolation model. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we give numerical values for \u03b7 c (\u03b3). The asymptotic behavior of \u03b7 c (\u03b3) when \u03b3 tends to \u221e is also derived from a fluid flow analysis.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Aalto University"], "authors": ["Esa Hyyti\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hyyti=auml=:Esa", "J\u00f6rg Ott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ott:J=ouml=rg"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
