We present results for a study examining three visualization types (text-, map-, and time-based) for social sharing of past locations. Our results reveal that there are important design implications for location sharing applications, as certain visual elements led to more privacy concerns and inaccurate perceptions of privacy control.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Karen P.
