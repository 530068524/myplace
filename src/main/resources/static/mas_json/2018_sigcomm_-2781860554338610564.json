{"title": "Sketchlearn: relieving user burdens in approximate measurement with automated statistical inference.", "fields": ["observational error", "statistical inference", "software deployment", "distributed computing", "testbed"], "abstract": "Network measurement is challenged to fulfill stringent resource requirements in the face of massive network traffic. While approximate measurement can trade accuracy for resource savings, it demands intensive manual efforts to configure the right resource-accuracy trade-offs in real deployment. Such user burdens are caused by how existing approximate measurement approaches inherently deal with resource conflicts when tracking massive network traffic with limited resources. In particular, they tightly couple resource configurations with accuracy parameters, so as to provision sufficient resources to bound the measurement errors. We design SketchLearn, a novel sketch-based measurement framework that resolves resource conflicts by learning their statistical properties to eliminate conflicting traffic components. We prototype SketchLearn on OpenVSwitch and P4, and our testbed experiments and stress-test simulation show that SketchLearn accurately and automatically monitors various traffic statistics and effectively supports network-wide measurement with limited resources.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Qun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Qun", "Patrick P.
