We analyze how discourses around 'critical design' are diverging in Design and HCI. We argue that this divergence undermines HCI's ability to learn from and appropriate the design approaches signaled by this term. Instead, we articulate two ways to broaden and deepen connections between Design and HCI: (1) develop a broader collective understanding of what these design approaches can be, without forcing them to be about 'criticality' or 'critical design,' narrowly construed; and (2) shape a variation of design criticism to better meet Design practices, terms, and ways of knowing.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Cornell University", "University of Washington", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Goldsmiths, University of London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["James Pierce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pierce:James", "Phoebe Sengers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sengers:Phoebe", "Tad Hirsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirsch:Tad", "Tom Jenkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jenkins:Tom", "William W.
