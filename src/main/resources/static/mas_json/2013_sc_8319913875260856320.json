Recent work shows that automatic extraction of pipeline parallelism is an effective way to speed up single thread execution. However, two problems remain challenging -- load balancing and inter-thread communication. This work shows new mechanism to exploit pipeline parallelism that naturally solves the load balancing and communication problems. This compiler-based technique automatically extracts the pipeline stages and executes them in a data parallel fashion, using token-based chunked synchronization to handle sequential stages. This technique provides linear speedup for several applications, and outperforms prior techniques to exploit pipeline parallelism by as much as 50%.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of Orl\u00e9ans", "University of Orl\u00e9ans"], "authors": ["Md Kamruzzaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamruzzaman:Md", "Steven Swanson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swanson:Steven", "Dean M.
