{"title": "A Latent Topic Model for Complete Entity Resolution.", "fields": ["vocabulary", "generative grammar", "topic model", "name resolution", "latent dirichlet allocation"], "abstract": "In bibliographies like DBLP and Citeseer, there are three kinds of entity-name problems that need to be solved. First, multiple entities share one name, which is called the name sharing problem. Second, one entity has different names, which is called the name variant problem. Third, multiple entities share multiple names, which is called the name mixing problem. We aim to solve these problems based on one model in this paper. We call this task complete entity resolution. Different from previous work, our work use global information based on data with two types of information, words and author names. We propose a generative latent topic model that involves both author names and words \u2014 the LDA-dual model, by extending the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model. We also propose a method to obtain model parameters that is global information. Based on obtained model parameters, we propose two algorithms to solve the three problems mentioned above. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of the proposed model and algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Binghamton University", "Binghamton University", "Binghamton University"], "authors": ["Liangcai Shu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shu:Liangcai", "Bo Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Bo", "Weiyi Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Weiyi"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
