{"title": "An approximation algorithm for client assignment in client/server systems.", "fields": ["client server model", "heuristic", "round robin dns", "assignment problem", "semidefinite programming"], "abstract": "One type of distributed systems is the client/server system consist of clients and servers. In order to improve the performance of such a system, client assignment strategy plays an important role. There are two criteria to evaluate the load on the servers \u2014 total load and load balance. The total load increases when the load balance decreases, vice versa. It has been proved that finding the best client assignment is NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a new model for the client assignment problem and design an algorithm based on Semidefinite programming (SDP). Our method has a (relaxed) performance ratio 0.87 when only 2 servers exist. In general case, our method becomes a heuristic, and the ratio of each iteration is 0.87. We are the first one to give these bounds. Our simulation results are compared with the state- of-art client assignment method, and our strategy outperforms it in terms of running time while keeps the load in similar level.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "Taiyuan University of Technology", "University of New Mexico", "University of Washington", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Yuqing Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yuqing", "Weili Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Weili", "James Willson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willson:James", "Ling Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Ling", "Lidong Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Lidong", "Deying Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Deying", "Wonjun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wonjun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
