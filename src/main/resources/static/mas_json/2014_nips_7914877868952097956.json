Unlike most prior work which has examined this problem under the random worker paradigm, we consider a much broader class of adversarial workers with no specific assumptions on their labeling strategy. Our key contribution is the design of a computationally efficient reputation algorithm to identify and filter out these adversarial workers in crowd-sourcing systems. Our algorithm uses the concept of optimal semi-matchings in conjunction with worker penalties based on label disagreements, to assign a reputation score for every worker. We provide strong theoretical guarantees for deterministic adversarial strategies as well as the extreme case of sophisticated adversaries where we analyze the worst-case behavior of our algorithm. Finally, we show that our reputation algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of existing label aggregation algorithms in real-world crowdsourcing datasets.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University Abu Dhabi", "New York University Abu Dhabi"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Srikanth Jagabathula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jagabathula:Srikanth", "Lakshminarayanan Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Lakshminarayanan", "Ashwin Venkataraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkataraman:Ashwin"], "pages": 9}
