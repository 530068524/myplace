{"title": "Stam's Collision Resistance Conjecture.", "fields": ["multiplicative function", "conjecture", "collision resistance", "random function", "collision"], "abstract": "At CRYPTO 2008 Stam [7] made the following conjecture: if an m+s-bit to s-bit compression function F makes r calls to a primitive f of n-bit input, then a collision for F can be obtained (with high probability) using r2(nr\u2212m)/(r+1) queries to f. For example, a 2n-bit to n-bit compression function making two calls to a random function of n-bit input cannot have collision security exceeding 2n/3. We prove this conjecture up to a constant multiplicative factor and under the condition m\u2032 :=(2m\u2212n(r\u22121))/(r+1)\u2265log2(17). This covers nearly all cases r=1 of the conjecture and the aforementioned example of a 2n-bit to n-bit compression function making two calls to a primitive of n-bit input.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Tsinghua University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["John P.
