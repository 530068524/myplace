We argue that the complexity of convex minimization is only determined by the rate of growth of the function around its minimizer xf,S , as quantified by a Tsybakov-like noise condition. Specifically, we prove that if f grows at least as fast as \u2016x \u2212 xf,S\u2016 around its minimum, for some \u03ba > 1, then the optimal rate of learning f(xf,S) is \u0398(T \u2212 \u03ba 2\u03ba\u22122 ). The classic rate \u0398(1/ \u221a T ) for convex functions and \u0398(1/T ) for strongly convex functions are special cases of our result for \u03ba\u2192\u221e and \u03ba = 2, and even faster rates are attained for \u03ba < 2. We also derive tight bounds for the complexity of learning xf,S , where the optimal rate is \u0398(T\u2212 1 2\u03ba\u22122 ). Interestingly, these precise rates for convex optimization also characterize the complexity of active learning and our results further strengthen the connections between the two fields, both of which rely on feedback-driven queries.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Aaditya Ramdas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramdas:Aaditya", "Aarti Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Aarti"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
