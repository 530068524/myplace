One important problem in RFID systems is how to quickly estimate the number of distinct tags without reading each tag individually. This problem plays a crucial role in many real-time monitoring and privacy-preserving applications. In this paper, we present an efficient and anonymous scheme for tag population estimation. This scheme leverages the position of the first reply from a group of tags in a frame. Results from mathematical analysis and extensive simulation demonstrate that our scheme outperforms other protocols proposed in the previous work.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "Northeastern University", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Hao Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Hao", "Bo Sheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheng:Bo", "Chiu Chiang Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chiu_Chiang", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun", "Weizhen Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Weizhen", "Sanglu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Sanglu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
