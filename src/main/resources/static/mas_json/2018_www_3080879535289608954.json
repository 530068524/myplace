{"title": "Prediction of Sparse User-Item Consumption Rates with Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression.", "fields": ["data set", "poisson distribution", "zero inflated model", "embedding", "active listening"], "abstract": "There are a variety of applications where user behavior consists of a combination of both repeat item consumption and new item consumption, such as listening to music artists, visiting Web sites, purchasing groceries, and so on. In this paper we address the problem of building user models that can predict the rate at which individuals consume both old and new items. We use zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression models as the basis for our modeling approach, leading to a general framework for modeling user-item consumption rates over time. We show that these models are more flexible in capturing user behavior than alternatives such as well-known latent factor and embedding models. We compare the performance of ZIP regression and latent factor and embedding models on three different data sets involving music, restaurant reviews, and social media. The ZIP regression models are systematically more accurate across all three data sets across different prediction metrics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Moshe Lichman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lichman:Moshe", "Padhraic Smyth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smyth:Padhraic"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
