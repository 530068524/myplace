{"title": "Using tagged images of low visual ambiguity to boost the learning efficiency of object detectors.", "fields": ["training set", "small number", "feature vector", "ambiguity", "bootstrapping"], "abstract": "Motivated by the abundant availability of user-generated multimedia content, a data augmentation approach that enhances an initial manually labelled training set with regions from user tagged images is presented. Initially, object detection classifiers are trained using a small number of manually labelled regions as the training set. Then, a set of positive regions is automatically selected from a large number of loosely tagged images, pre-segmented by an automatic segmentation algorithm, to enhance the initial training set. In order to overcome the noisy nature of user tagged images and the lack of information about the pixel level annotations, the main contribution of this work is the introduction of the visual ambiguity term. Visual ambiguity is caused by the visual similarity of semantically dissimilar concepts with respect to the employed visual representation and analysis system (i.e. segmentation, feature space, classifier) and, in this work, is modelled so that the images where ambiguous concepts co-exist are penalized. Preliminary experimental results show that the employment of visual ambiguity guides the selection process away from the ambiguous images and, as a result, allows for better separation between the targeted true positive and the undesired negative regions.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Surrey"], "authors": ["Elisavet Chatzilari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatzilari:Elisavet"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
