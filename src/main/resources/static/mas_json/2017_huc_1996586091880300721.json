Incoming call notifications such as ringing at an inopportune moment (e.g., meeting) can cause interruptions for both the users and the surrounding people. In this paper, we present a  system architecture  for managing call interruptions according to individual's  call response behavioral rules.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Swinburne University of Technology", "Charles Sturt University", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology"], "authors": ["Iqbal H.
