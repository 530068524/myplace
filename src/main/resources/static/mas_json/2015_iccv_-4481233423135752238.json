{"title": "Exploiting High Level Scene Cues in Stereo Reconstruction.", "fields": ["triangulation", "human visual system model", "pattern recognition", "computer vision", "3d reconstruction"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction which is inspired by the human visual system. This system unifies standard appearance matching and triangulation techniques with higher level reasoning and scene understanding, in order to resolve ambiguities between different interpretations of the scene. The types of reasoning integrated in the approach includes recognising common configurations of surface normals and semantic edges (e.g. convex, concave and occlusion boundaries). We also recognise the coplanar, collinear and symmetric structures which are especially common in man made environments.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of Surrey"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Simon Hadfield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hadfield:Simon", "Richard Bowden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowden:Richard"], "pages": 9}
