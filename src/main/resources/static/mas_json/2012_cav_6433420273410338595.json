So far, there are no practical general-purpose countermeasures against this threat. In this paper we propose a novel method for automatically deriving upper bounds on the amount of information about the input that an adversary can extract from a program by observing the CPU's cache behavior. At the heart of our approach is a novel technique for efficient counting of concretizations of abstract cache states that enables us to connect state-of-the-art techniques for static cache analysis and quantitative information-flow. We implement our counting procedure on top of the AbsInt TimingExplorer, one of the most advanced engines for static cache analysis. We use our tool to perform a case study where we derive upper bounds on the cache leakage of a 128-bit AES executable on an ARM processor. We also analyze this implementation with a commonly suggested (but until now heuristic) countermeasure applied, obtaining a formal account of the corresponding increase in security.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["IMDEA", "IMDEA", "Technical University of Dortmund"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Boris K\u00f6pf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=pf:Boris", "Laurent Mauborgne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mauborgne:Laurent", "Mart\u00edn Ochoa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ochoa:Mart=iacute=n"], "pages": 17}
