This is accomplished by first computing a colorblind accessibility quantity for each image of interest in the search results. A colorblind accessibility quantity quantizes the degree to which color information is preserved when an image is perceived by a colorblind person viewing the image. It is computed by generating a colorblind version of an image that simulates how the image would appear to the colorblind person. An amount quantifying the loss of color information between the image and the colorblind version of the image is then estimated. This estimate is used to compute the colorblind accessibility quantity for the image. Once the colorblind accessibility quantities have been computed, the image search results are re-ranked based on these quantities.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Meng", "Bo Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Bo", "Xian-Sheng Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Xian=Sheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
