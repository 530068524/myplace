{"title": "No Escape From Reality: Security and Privacy of Augmented Reality Browsers.", "fields": ["functional requirement", "browser security", "augmented reality", "enterprise information security architecture", "internet security"], "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) browsers are an emerging category of mobile applications that add interactive virtual objects to the user's view of the physical world. This paper gives the first system-level evaluation of their security and privacy properties.   We start by analyzing the functional requirements that AR browsers must support in order to present AR content. We then investigate the security architecture of Junaio, Layar, and Wikitude browsers, which are running today on over 30 million mobile devices, and identify new categories of security and privacy vulnerabilities unique to AR browsers. Finally, we provide the first engineering guidelines for securely implementing AR functionality.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Richard McPherson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McPherson:Richard", "Suman Jana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jana:Suman", "Vitaly Shmatikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shmatikov:Vitaly"], "conf": "www", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
