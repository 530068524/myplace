{"title": "Flexible cache error protection using an ECC FIFO.", "fields": ["pipeline burst cache", "cache pollution", "bus sniffing", "smart cache", "mesi protocol"], "abstract": "We present ECC FIFO, a mechanism enabling two-tiered last-level cache error protection using an arbitrarily strong tier-2 code without increasing on-chip storage. Instead of adding redundant ECC information to each cache line, our ECC FIFO mechanism off-loads the extra information to off-chip DRAM. We augment each cache line with a tier-1 code, which provides error detection consuming limited resources. The redundancy required for strong protection is provided by a tier-2 code placed in off-chip memory. Because errors that require tier-2 correction are rare, the overhead of accessing DRAM is unimportant. We show how this method can save 15--25% and 10--17% of on-chip cache area and power respectively while minimally impacting performance, which decreases by 1% on average across a range of scientific and consumer benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Doe Hyun Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Doe_Hyun", "Mattan Erez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erez:Mattan"], "pages": -1}
