{"title": "Diversity for design: a framework for involving neurodiverse children in the technology design process.", "fields": ["cognitive reframing", "design technology", "neurodiversity", "participatory design", "dyslexia"], "abstract": "The neurodiversity movement seeks to positively reframe certain neurological conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and dyslexia, by concentrating on their strengths. In recent years, neurodiverse children have increasingly been involved in the technology design process, but the design approaches adopted have focused mostly on overcoming difficulties of working with these children, leaving their strengths untapped. We present a new participatory design (PD) framework, Diversity for Design (D4D), which provides guidance for technology designers working with neurodiverse children in establishing PD methods that capitalize on children's strengths and also support potential difficulties. We present two case studies of use of the D4D framework, involving children with ASD and dyslexia, showing how it informed the development and refinement of PD methods tailored to these populations. In addition, we show how to apply the D4D framework to other neurodiverse populations.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Institute of Education", "Institute of Education", "University of Malta", "University of Bath", "Institute of Education"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Laura Benton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benton:Laura", "Asimina Vasalou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasalou:Asimina", "Rilla Khaled.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khaled:Rilla", "Hilary Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Hilary", "Daniel Gooch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gooch:Daniel"], "pages": 10}
