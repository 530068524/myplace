{"title": "Beyond Uniformity: Better Security/Efficiency Tradeoffs for Compression Functions.", "fields": ["random oracle", "fold", "collision resistance", "random function", "preimage attack"], "abstract": "Suppose we are given a perfect  n +  c -to- n bit compression function  f and we want to construct a larger  m +  s -to- s bit compression function  H instead. What level of security, in particular collision resistance, can we expect from  H if it makes  r calls to  f ? We conjecture that typically collisions can be found in 2( nr +  cr i\u00be?  m )/( r + 1)queries. This bound is also relevant for building a  m +  s -to- s bit compression function based on a blockcipher with  k -bit keys and  n -bit blocks: simply set  c =  k , or  c = 0 in case of fixed keys.\n\nWe also exhibit a number of (conceptual) compression functions whose collision resistance is close to this bound. In particular, we consider the following four scenarios:    1 A 2 n -to- n bit compression function making two calls to an  n -to- n bit primitive, providing collision resistance up to 2 n /3/ n queries. This beats a recent bound by Rogaway and Steinberger that 2 n /4queries to the underlying random  n -to- n bit function suffice to find collisions in any rate-1/2 compression function. In particular, this shows that Rogaway and Steinberger's recent bound of 2( nr i\u00be?  m i\u00be?  s /2)/ r )queries (for  c = 0) crucially relies upon a uniformity assumption; a blanket generalization to arbitrary compression functions would be incorrect.\n   1 A 3 n -to-2 n bit compression function making a single call to a 3 n -to- n bit primitive, providing collision resistance up to 2 n queries.\n   1 A 3 n -to-2 n bit compression function making two calls to a 2 n -to- n bit primitive, providing collision resistance up to 2 n queries.\n   1 A single call compression function with parameters satisfying  m \u2264  n +  c ,  n \u2264  s ,  c \u2264  m . This result provides a tradeoff between how many bits you can compress for what level of security given a single call to an  n +  c -to- n bit random function.", "citation": "Citations (409)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Martijn Stam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stam:Martijn"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 16}
