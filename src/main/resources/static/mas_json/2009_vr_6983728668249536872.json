Its main distinguishing factor is a fine-grained spatial (i. e., both geometric and topological) model of the display layout. Using this model, Deskotheque allows seamless mouse pointer navigation and application window sharing across the multi-display environment. Geometric compensation of casually aligned multi-projector displays supports a wide range of display configurations. Mouse pointer redirection and window migration are tightly integrated into the windowing system, while geometric compensation of projected imagery is accomplished by a 3D compositing window manager. Thus, Deskotheque provides sharing of unmodified desktop application windows across display and workstation boundaries without compromising hardware-accelerated rendering of 2D or 3D content on projected tiled displays with geometric compensation.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "authors": ["Christian Pirchheim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pirchheim:Christian", "Manuela Waldner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waldner:Manuela", "Dieter Schmalstieg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmalstieg:Dieter"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
