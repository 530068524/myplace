{"title": "Mini-Me: A min-repro system for database software.", "fields": ["scripting language", "automation", "visualization", "high level programming language", "debugging"], "abstract": "Testing and debugging database software is often challenging and time consuming. A very arduous task for DB testers is finding a min-repro - the \u201csimplest possible setup\u201d that reproduces the original problem. Currently, a great deal of searching for min-repros is carried out manually using non-database-specific tools, which is both slow and error-prone. We propose to demonstrate a system, called Mini-Me 1 , designed to ease and speed-up the task of finding min-repros in database-related products. Mini-Me employs several effective tools, including: the novel simplification transformations, the high-level language for creating search scripts and automation, the \u201crecord-and-replay\u201d functionality, and the visualization of the search space and results. In addition to the standard application mode, the system can be interacted with in the game mode. The latter can provide an intrinsically motivating environment for developing successful search strategies by DB testers, which can be data-mined and recorded as patterns and used as recommendations for DB testers in the future. Potentially, a system like Mini-Me can save hours of time (for both customers and testers to isolate a problem), which could result in faster fixes and large cost savings to organizations.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Nicolas Bruno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruno:Nicolas", "Rimma V.
