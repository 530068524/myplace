It shows a continuous slideshow of photographs retrieved from the Flickr\u2122 image website using a set of six predefined categories modified by a tuneable degree of 'semantic drift'. In this paper, we describe the design process that led to the Photostroller, and summarise observations made during a deployment in the care home that has lasted over two months at the time of writing. We suggest that the Photostroller balances constraint with openness, and control with drift, to provide an effective resource for the ludic engagement of a diverse group of older people with each other and the world outside their home.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of London", "University of London", "University of London", "Northumbria University", "University of London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["William W.
