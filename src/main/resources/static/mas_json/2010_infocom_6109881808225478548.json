We propose a new set of patterns, particularly when sensors' communication range (  $r_{\\rm c}$  ) is relatively small compared to their sensing range (  $r_{\\rm s}$  ), and prove their optimality. In this study, we discover an interesting phenomenon\u2014pattern mutation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that mutation in pattern deployments has been discovered. This phenomenon, which contradicts the conjecture presented in a previous work that there exists a universal elemental pattern among optimal pattern deployment, significantly furthers our understanding of optimal patterns in WSNs.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "departments": ["Soochow University", "Ohio State University", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of Macau", "Ohio State University", "Soochow University", "Ohio State University", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of Macau", "Advanced Analyt ... n, Columbus, OH"], "authors": ["Xiaole Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Xiaole", "Ziqiu Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Ziqiu", "Dong Xuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xuan:Dong", "Weijia Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Weijia", "Wei Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Wei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
