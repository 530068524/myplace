These new features are motivated by the fact that local symmetries, at different scales, are a fundamental characteristic of many urban images, and are potentially more invariant to large appearance changes than lower-level features such as SIFT. Hence, we apply these features to the problem of matching challenging pairs of photos of urban scenes. Our features are based on simple measures of local bilateral and rotational symmetries computed using local image operations. These measures are used both for feature detection and for computing descriptors. We demonstrate our method on a challenging new dataset containing image pairs exhibiting a range of dramatic variations in lighting, age, and rendering style, and show that our features can improve matching performance for this difficult task.", "citation": "Citations (119)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Daniel Cabrini Hauagge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hauagge:Daniel_Cabrini", "Noah Snavely.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snavely:Noah"], "pages": 8}
