Considering conditions like the path loss and multi-path effect in realistic settings, we first propose a probabilistic model for RFID tag identification. Based on this model, we propose efficient solutions to identify moving RFID tags, according to the fixed-path mobility on the conveyor. A dynamic program based solution and an adaptive solution are proposed to select optimized frame sizes during the query cycles. Simulation results indicate that by leveraging the probabilistic model our solutions can achieve much better performance than using parameters for the ideal propagation situations.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Lei Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0004:Lei", "Bo Sheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheng:Bo", "Chiu Chiang Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chiu_Chiang", "Hao Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Hao", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun", "Daoxu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Daoxu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
