While provenance models have been extensively discussed in recent years, little attention has been given to the efficient implementation of provenance-enabled queries inside data stores. This paper introduces TripleProv: a new system extending a native RDF store to efficiently handle such queries. TripleProv implements two different storage models to physically co-locate lineage and instance data, and for each of them implements algorithms for tracing provenance at two granularity levels. In the following, we present the overall architecture of our system, its different lineage storage models, and the various query execution strategies we have implemented to efficiently answer provenance-enabled queries. In addition, we present the results of a comprehensive empirical evaluation of our system over two different datasets and workloads.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Fribourg", "University of Fribourg", "VU University Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Marcin Wylot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wylot:Marcin", "Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cudr=eacute==Mauroux:Philippe", "Paul T.
