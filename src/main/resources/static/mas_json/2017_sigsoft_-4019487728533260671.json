Our objective is to examine how strong metrics for agile (Scrum) DevOps teams can be set in an iterative fashion. We perform an exploratory case study that focuses on the classification based on predictive power of software metrics, in which we analyze log data derived from two initial sources within this pipeline. We analyzed a subset of 16 metrics from 59 squads. We identified two lagging metrics and assessed four leading metrics to be strong.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "ING Group", "ING Group", "ING Group", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Hennie Huijgens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huijgens:Hennie", "Robert Lamping.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lamping:Robert", "Dick Stevens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stevens:Dick", "Hartger Rothengatter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rothengatter:Hartger", "Georgios Gousios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gousios:Georgios", "Daniele Romano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romano:Daniele"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
