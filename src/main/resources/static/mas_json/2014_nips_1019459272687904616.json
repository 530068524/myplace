In particular, our method achieves faster linear convergence rates for minimizing strongly convex functions than existing randomized proximal coordinate gradient methods. We show how to apply the APCG method to solve the dual of the regularized empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem, and devise efficient implementations that avoid full-dimensional vector operations. For ill-conditioned ERM problems, our method obtains improved convergence rates than the state-of-the-art stochastic dual coordinate ascent (SDCA) method.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Iowa", "Simon Fraser University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Qihang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Qihang", "Zhaosong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhaosong", "Lin Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Lin"], "pages": 9}
