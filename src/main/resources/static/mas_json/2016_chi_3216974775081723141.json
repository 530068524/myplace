{"title": "Design and Evaluation of a Multi-Player Mobile Game for Icebreaking Activity.", "fields": ["information asymmetry", "social relation", "multimedia", "facilitator", "wi fi direct"], "abstract": "In collaboration between strangers, group formation and familiarization often take a lot of time. To facilitate this, icebreaking activities are commonly utilized, aiming at a positive and relaxing social atmosphere. To explore how interactive technology could serve as a tool in such social activity, we developed Who's Next, a multiplayer quiz-based mobile game intended to break the ice in a group of strangers. The design utilizes the information asymmetry between people, aiming to encourage joint activity between them. We conducted six evaluation sessions where four to six participants in each played the game together and were interviewed. Who's Next was found to be a promising support for icebreaking. It was considered to offer a comfortable way of sharing information about oneself and getting to know newly-met strangers. We conclude that interactive technology could successfully support the facilitator role in encouraging interaction and creating a relaxed atmosphere between strangers.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Pradthana Jarusriboonchai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jarusriboonchai:Pradthana", "Aris Malapaschas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malapaschas:Aris", "Thomas Olsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olsson_0002:Thomas"], "pages": 12}
