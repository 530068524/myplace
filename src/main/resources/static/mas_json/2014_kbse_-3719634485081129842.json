Finding the appropriate developer to a CR is crucial for obtaining the lowest, economically feasible, fixing time. Nevertheless, assigning CRs is a labor-intensive and time consuming task. In this paper, we present a semi-automated CR assignment approach which combine rule-based and information retrieval techniques. The approach emphasizes the use of contextual information, essential to effective assignments, and puts the development team in control of the assignment rules, toward making its adoption easier. Results of an empirical evaluation showed that the approach is up to 46,5% more accurate than approaches which rely solely on machine learning techniques.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Federal University of Bahia", "Federal University of Pernambuco", "Federal University of Bahia", "Federal University of Pernambuco", "Brazilian Feder ... n\u00f3polis, Brazil"], "authors": ["Yguarat\u00e3 Cerqueira Cavalcanti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cavalcanti:Yguarat=atilde=_Cerqueira", "Ivan do Carmo Machado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Machado:Ivan_do_Carmo", "Paulo Anselmo da Mota Silveira Neto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neto:Paulo_Anselmo_da_Mota_Silveira", "Eduardo Santana de Almeida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almeida:Eduardo_Santana_de", "Silvio Romero de Lemos Meira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meira:Silvio_Romero_de_Lemos"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 6}
