I'm Socializing!: A Breakpoint-Based Smartphone Notification System.", "fields": ["notification system", "mobile computing", "socialization", "silence", "breakpoint"], "abstract": "Smartphone notifications provide application-specific information in real-time, but could distract users from in-person social interactions when delivered at inopportune moments. We explore breakpoint-based notification management, in which the smartphone defers notifications until an opportune moment. With a video survey where participants selected appropriate moments for notifications from a video-recorded social interaction, we identify four breakpoint types: long silence, a user leaving the table, others using smartphones, and a user left alone. We introduce a Social Context-Aware smartphone Notification system, SCAN, that uses build-in sensors to detect social context and identifies breakpoints to defer smartphone notifications until a breakpoint. We conducted a controlled study with ten friend groups who had SCAN installed on their smartphones while dining at a restaurant. Results show that SCAN accurately detects breakpoints (precision=92.0%, recall=82.5%), and reduces notification interruptions by 54.1%. Most participants reported that SCAN helped them to focus better on in-person social interaction and found selected breakpoints appropriate.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Chunjong Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Chunjong", "Junsung Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Junsung", "Juho Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Juho", "Sung-Ju Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sung=Ju", "Dongman Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Dongman"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
