{"title": "Matching users and items across domains to improve the recommendation quality.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "matrix decomposition", "transfer of learning", "collaborative filtering", "matrix"], "abstract": "Given two homogeneous rating matrices with some overlapped users/items whose mappings are unknown, this paper aims at answering two questions. First, can we identify the unknown mapping between the users and/or items? Second, can we further utilize the identified mappings to improve the quality of recommendation in either domain? Our solution integrates a latent space matching procedure and a refining process based on the optimization of prediction to identify the matching. Then, we further design a transfer-based method to improve the recommendation performance. Using both synthetic and real data, we have done extensive experiments given different real life scenarios to verify the effectiveness of our models.
