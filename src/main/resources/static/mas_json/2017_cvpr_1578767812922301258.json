{"title": "Split-Brain Autoencoders: Unsupervised Learning by Cross-Channel Prediction.", "fields": ["feature learning", "autoencoder", "competitive learning", "disjoint sets", "transfer of learning"], "abstract": "We propose split-brain autoencoders, a straightforward modification of the traditional autoencoder architecture, for unsupervised representation learning. The method adds a split to the network, resulting in two disjoint sub-networks. Each sub-network is trained to perform a difficult task \u2013 predicting one subset of the data channels from another. Together, the sub-networks extract features from the entire input signal. By forcing the network to solve cross-channel prediction tasks, we induce a representation within the network which transfers well to other, unseen tasks. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several large-scale transfer learning benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Richard Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Richard", "Phillip Isola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isola:Phillip", "Alexei A.
