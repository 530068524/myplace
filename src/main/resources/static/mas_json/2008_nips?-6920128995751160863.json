Recent research has been aimed at learning discriminative sparse models instead of purely reconstructive ones. This paper proposes a new step in that direction, with a novel sparse representation for signals belonging to different classes in terms of a shared dictionary and discriminative class models. The linear version of the proposed model admits a simple probabilistic interpretation, while its most general variant admits an interpretation in terms of kernels. An optimization framework for learning all the components of the proposed model is presented, along with experimental results on standard handwritten digit and texture classification tasks.", "citation": "Citations (1,047)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "WILLOW", "WILLOW, LIENS", "WILLOW, VGG", "WILLOW"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Julien Mairal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mairal:Julien", "Francis R.
