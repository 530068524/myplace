{"title": "Optimistic posterior sampling for reinforcement learning: worst-case regret bounds.", "fields": ["time horizon", "dirichlet distribution", "markov decision process", "thompson sampling", "regret"], "abstract": "We present an algorithm based on posterior sampling (aka Thompson sampling) that achieves near-optimal worst-case regret bounds when the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) is communicating with a finite, though unknown, diameter. Our main result is a high probability regret upper bound of $\\tilde{O}(D\\sqrt{SAT})$ for any communicating MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions and diameter $D$, when $T\\ge S^5A$. Here, regret compares the total reward achieved by the algorithm to the total expected reward of an optimal infinite-horizon undiscounted average reward policy, in time horizon $T$. This result improves over the best previously known upper bound of $\\tilde{O}(DS\\sqrt{AT})$ achieved by any algorithm in this setting, and matches the dependence on $S$ in the established lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{DSAT})$ for this problem. Our techniques involve proving some novel results about the anti-concentration of Dirichlet distribution, which may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shipra Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal_0001:Shipra", "Randy Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Randy"], "pages": 11}
