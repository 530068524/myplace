{"title": "Recursive MDL via graph cuts: Application to segmentation.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "u matrix", "range segmentation", "region growing", "minimum spanning tree based segmentation"], "abstract": "We propose a novel patch-based image representation that is useful because it (1) inherently detects regions with repetitive structure at multiple scales and (2) yields a parameterless hierarchical segmentation. We describe an image by breaking it into coherent regions where each region is well-described (easily reconstructed) by repeatedly instantiating a patch using a set of simple transformations. In other words, a good segment is one that has sufficient repetition of some pattern, and a patch is useful if it contains a pattern that is repeated in the image.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Western Ontario", "University of Western Ontario", "University of Western Ontario", "University of Western Ontario"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Lena Gorelick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorelick:Lena", "Andrew Delong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delong:Andrew", "Olga Veksler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veksler:Olga", "Yuri Boykov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boykov:Yuri"], "pages": 8}
