While the former provides real modularity, the latter excels concerning expressiveness. To combine the respective advantages of compositional and annotative approaches, we aim at unifying their underlying representations by leveraging the snippet system instead of directories and files. In addition, to exploit this unification, we propose different editable views.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Benjamin Behringer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Behringer:Benjamin"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
