{"title": "Visual exploration of collaboration networks based on graph degeneracy.", "fields": ["strength of a graph", "friendship graph", "butterfly graph", "loop", "degeneracy"], "abstract": "We demonstrate a system that supports the visual exploration of collaboration networks. The system leverages the notion of fractional cores introduced in earlier work to rank vertices in a collaboration network and filter vertices' neighborhoods. Fractional cores build on the idea of graph degeneracy as captured by the notion of  k -cores in graph theory and extend it to undirected edge-weighted graphs. In a co-authorship network, for instance, the fractional core index of an author intuitively reflects the degree of collaboration with equally or higher-ranked authors. Our system has been deployed on a real-world co-authorship network derived from DBLP, demonstrating that the idea of fractional cores can be applied even to large-scale networks. The system provides an easy-to-use interface to query for the fractional core index of an author, to see who the closest equally or higher-ranked co-authors are, and explore the entire co-authorship network in an incremental manner.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens", "Athens State University"], "authors": ["Christos Giatsidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giatsidis:Christos", "Klaus Berberich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berberich:Klaus", "Dimitrios M.
