{"title": "Neural Universal Discrete Denoiser.", "fields": ["hyperparameter", "training set", "supervised learning", "artificial neural network", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present a new framework of applying deep neural networks (DNN) to devise a universal discrete denoiser. Unlike other approaches that utilize supervised learning for denoising, we do not require any additional training data. In such setting, while the ground-truth label, i.e., the clean data, is not available, we devise ``pseudo-labels'' and a novel objective function such that DNN can be trained in a same way as supervised learning to become a discrete denoiser. We experimentally show that our resulting algorithm, dubbed as Neural DUDE, significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in several applications with a systematic rule of choosing the hyperparameter, which is an attractive feature in practice.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Taesup Moon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moon:Taesup", "Seonwoo Min.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Min:Seonwoo", "Byunghan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Byunghan", "Sungroh Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Sungroh"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
