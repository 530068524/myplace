Users can watch content shown on an HMD hands-free even when moving or working. It seems that presenting specific information affects humans. In this paper, we investigate the effects on listening to speech information that are caused by presenting animation on an HMD. It is difficult to listen to information that is presented in noisy surroundings. If the solution were only to turn up the volume, we would feel uncomfortable because this is very inconvenient. Therefore, by additionally presenting animation, we aim to make it easy for users to listen to speech information. With our method, we use lip-sync animation that matches specific speech information. We performed two experiments to determine whether it is easier to get speech information with animation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Kobe University", "Kobe University", "Kobe University"], "authors": ["Naoya Isoyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isoyama:Naoya", "Tsutomu Terada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terada:Tsutomu", "Masahiko Tsukamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsukamoto:Masahiko"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
