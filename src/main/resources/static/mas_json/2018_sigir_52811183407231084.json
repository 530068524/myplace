{"title": "Robust Asymmetric Recommendation via Min-Max Optimization.", "fields": ["matrix norm", "singular value decomposition", "exploit", "outlier", "subgradient method"], "abstract": "Recommender systems with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks and purchases) suffer from two critical limitations: 1) imbalanced labels may mislead the learning process of the conventional models that assign balanced weights to the classes; and 2) outliers with large reconstruction errors may dominate the objective function by the conventional $L_2$-norm loss. To address these issues, we propose a robust asymmetric recommendation model. It integrates cost-sensitive learning with capped unilateral loss into a joint objective function, which can be optimized by an iteratively weighted approach. To reduce the computational cost of low-rank approximation, we exploit the dual characterization of the nuclear norm to derive a min-max optimization problem and design a subgradient algorithm without performing full SVD. Finally, promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark recommendation datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "SCUT, Guangzhou, China"], "authors": ["Peng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Peng", "Peilin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Peilin", "Vincent W.
