In practical large scale image retrieval applications however, most images depict unique views where this idea does not apply. We exploit self-similarities, symmetries and repeating patterns to select features within a  single image . We achieve the same performance compared to the full feature set with only a small fraction of its index size on a dataset of  unique views  of buildings or urban scenes, in the presence of one million distractors of similar nature. Our best solution is linear in the number of correspondences, with practical running times of just a few milliseconds.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens"], "authors": ["Giorgos Tolias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tolias:Giorgos", "Yannis Kalantidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalantidis:Yannis", "Yannis S.
