Our goal is to find a mechanism that best approximates a given target function subject to a design constraint such as strategy-proofness or stability. The proposed approach involves identifying a rich parametrized class of mechanisms that resemble discriminantbased multiclass classifiers, and relaxing the resulting search problem into an SVM-style surrogate optimization problem. We use this methodology to design strategy-proof mechanisms for social choice problems with single-peaked preferences, and stable mechanisms for two-sided matching problems. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first automated approach for designing stable matching rules. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm the usefulness of our methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study", "Harvard University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Harikrishna Narasimhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narasimhan:Harikrishna", "Shivani Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal_0001:Shivani", "David C.
