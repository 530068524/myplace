We first analyze the phenomenon of large intra-class variation and attribute it to the \"subcategory\" problem. To reveal the local and distinct properties of the different subcategories, relative spaces are constructed. Then the weighted FLDs (Fisher Linear Discriminant) as weak learners trained in relative spaces are integrated with the boosting framework to form the final classifier. Experiments on 8 categories from Caltech database show the effectiveness of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Yi Ouyang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouyang:Yi", "Ming Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Ming", "Jinqiao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jinqiao", "Hanqing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hanqing", "Songde Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Songde"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
