{"title": "Locate the Hate: Detecting Tweets against Blacks.", "fields": ["data mining", "internet privacy", "labeled data", "classifier", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Although the social medium Twitter grants users freedom of speech, its instantaneous nature and retweeting features also amplify hate speech. Because Twitter has a sizeable black constituency, racist tweets against blacks are especially detrimental in the Twitter community, though this effect may not be obvious against a backdrop of half a billion tweets a day. We apply a supervised machine learning approach, employing inexpensively acquired labeled data from diverse Twitter accounts to learn a binary classifier for the labels \"racist\" and \"nonracist\" The classifier has a 76% average accuracy on individual tweets, suggesting that with further improvements, our work can contribute data on the sources of anti-black hate speech.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["Wellesley College", "Wellesley College"], "authors": ["Irene Kwok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwok:Irene", "Yuzhou Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuzhou"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
