Co-segmentation is the problem of simultaneously dividing multiple images into regions (segments) corresponding to different object classes. In this paper, we combine existing tools for bottom-up image segmentation such as normalized cuts, with kernel methods commonly used in object recognition. These two sets of techniques are used within a discriminative clustering framework: the goal is to assign foreground/background labels jointly to all images, so that a supervised classifier trained with these labels leads to maximal separation of the two classes. In practice, we obtain a combinatorial optimization problem which is relaxed to a continuous convex optimization problem, that can itself be solved efficiently for up to dozens of images. We illustrate the proposed method on images with very similar foreground objects, as well as on more challenging problems with objects with higher intra-class variations.", "citation": "Citations (396)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Armand Joulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joulin:Armand", "Francis R.
