This extends to decision all the worst-case hardness results that were previously known for the search version, for the same or even better parameters and with no algebraic restrictions on the modulus or number field. Indeed, our reduction is the first that works for decision Ring-LWE with any number field and any modulus.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris", "Oded Regev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regev_0001:Oded", "Noah Stephens-Davidowitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stephens=Davidowitz:Noah"], "pages": 13}
