{"title": "Opportunistic physical design for big data analytics.", "fields": ["physical design", "materialized view", "query rewriting", "semantic data model", "big data"], "abstract": "Big data analytical systems, such as MapReduce, perform aggressive materialization of intermediate job results in order to support fault tolerance. When jobs correspond to exploratory queries submitted by data analysts, these materializations yield a large set of materialized views that we propose to treat as an opportunistic physical design. We present a semantic model for UDFs that enables effective reuse of views containing UDFs along with a rewrite algorithm that provably finds the minimum-cost rewrite under certain assumptions. An experimental study on real-world datasets using our prototype based on Hive shows that our approach can result in dramatic performance improvements.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "NEC Labs Americ ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Labs Americ ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Labs Americ ... ertino, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jeff LeFevre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/LeFevre:Jeff", "Jagan Sankaranarayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankaranarayanan:Jagan", "Hakan Hacig\u00fcm\u00fcs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hacig=uuml=m=uuml=s:Hakan", "Jun'ichi Tatemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tatemura:Jun=ichi", "Neoklis Polyzotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polyzotis:Neoklis", "Michael J.
