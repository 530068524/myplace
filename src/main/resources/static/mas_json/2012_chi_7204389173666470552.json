We introduce the construct of service mediation, which includes the technical, social, and knowledge labor practices involved in enabling access to and use of an e-government service. We explore the service mediation activities of outreach, technological assistance, providing knowledge, and ongoing engagement. These activities bring to light how successful service relationships involve fostering a process, bridging relationships, and providing broader scaffolding. The results of our research highlight the role service mediation plays in the use of services and service technologies in information-rich organizations. This research extends previous conceptualizations of mediation by documenting how mediators support broader service processes for their clients, transform potential beneficiaries into clients, and engage in long term assistance. Therefore, this work moves beyond prior conceptualizations of mediation that concentrate solely on enabling access and use of specific technologies.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Lynn Dombrowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dombrowski:Lynn", "Amy Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Amy", "Gillian R.
