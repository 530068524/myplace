We prove a result representing a further quantum generalization of this fact, which is that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum zero-knowledge proof system. More specifically, assuming the existence of an unconditionally binding and quantum computationally concealing commitment scheme, we prove that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum interactive proof system that is zero-knowledge with respect to efficient quantum computations. Our QMA proof system is sound against arbitrary quantum provers, but only requires an honest prover to perform polynomial-time quantum computations, provided that it holds a quantum witness for a given instance of the QMA problem under consideration.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Ottawa", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Anne Broadbent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broadbent:Anne", "Zhengfeng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Zhengfeng", "Fang Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song_0001:Fang", "John Watrous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watrous:John"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
