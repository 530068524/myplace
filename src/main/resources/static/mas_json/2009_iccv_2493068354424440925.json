In this study, we aimed at improving the resolution of three-dimensional (3D) data obtained from moving targets. We present a simple clean and robust method that jointly estimates motion parameters and a high-resolution 3D shape. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yoshihiro Watanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watanabe:Yoshihiro", "Takashi Komuro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komuro:Takashi", "Masatoshi Ishikawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishikawa:Masatoshi"], "pages": 8}
