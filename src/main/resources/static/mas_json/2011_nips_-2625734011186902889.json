In particular, we show how to accelerate a flat histogram sampling technique by significantly reducing the number of \"null moves\" in the chain, while maintaining asymptotic convergence properties. Our experiments show that our method converges quickly to highly accurate solutions on a range of benchmark instances, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such as IJGP, TRW, and Gibbs sampling both in run-time and accuracy. We also show how obtaining a so-called density of states distribution allows for efficient weight learning in Markov Logic theories.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "IBM", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Stefano Ermon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ermon:Stefano", "Carla P.
