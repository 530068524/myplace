This paper presents Path Graph for improving iterative graph computation on graphs with billions of edges. Our system design has three unique features: First, we model a large graph using a collection of tree-based partitions and use an path-centric computation rather than vertex-centric or edge-centric computation. Our parallel computation model significantly improves the memory and disk locality for performing iterative computation algorithms. Second, we design a compact storage that further maximize sequential access and minimize random access on storage media. Third, we implement the path-centric computation model by using a scatter/gather programming model, which parallels the iterative computation at partition tree level and performs sequential updates for vertices in each partition tree. The experimental results show that the path-centric approach outperforms vertex centric and edge-centric systems on a number of graph algorithms for both in-memory and out-of-core graphs.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Pingpeng Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Pingpeng", "Wenya Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wenya", "Changfeng Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Changfeng", "Hai Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin_0001:Hai", "Ling Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ling", "Kisung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kisung"], "pages": 12}
