One specific application of this general approach, which is the focus of this paper, is distinguishing failed executions from successful executions. While existing efforts appear to produce accurate classifications, detailed understanding of their costs and potential cost-benefit tradeoffs is lacking. In this work, we present a hybrid instrumentation approach which uses hardware performance counters to gather program spectra at very low cost. This underlying data is further augmented with data captured by minimal amounts of software-level instrumentation. We also evaluate this hybrid approach by comparing it to other existing approaches. We conclude that these hybrid spectra can reliably distinguish failed executions from successful executions at a fraction of the runtime overhead cost of using software-only spectra.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Sabanc\u0131 University", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Cemal Yilmaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yilmaz:Cemal", "Adam A.
