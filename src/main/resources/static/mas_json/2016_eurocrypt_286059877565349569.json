An important recent work due to Barbulescu et al. builds upon existing works to propose two new methods for polynomial selection when the target field is a non-prime field. These methods are called the generalised Joux-Lercier GJL and the Conjugation methods. In this work, we propose a new method which we denote as $$\\mathcal {A}$$A for polynomial selection for the NFS algorithm in fields $$\\mathbb {F}_{Q}$$FQ, with $$Q=p^n$$Q=pn and $$n>1$$n>1. The new method both subsumes and generalises the GJL and the Conjugation methods and provides new trade-offs for both n composite and n prime. Let us denote the variant of the multiple NFS algorithm using the polynomial selection method \"X\" by MNFS-X. Asymptotic analysis is performed for both the NFS-$$\\mathcal {A}$$A and the MNFS-$$\\mathcal {A}$$A algorithms. In particular, when $$p=L_Q2/3,c_p$$p=LQ2/3,cp, for $$c_p\\in [3.39,20.91]$$cp\u2208[3.39,20.91], the complexity of NFS-$$\\mathcal {A}$$A is better than the complexities of all previous algorithms whether classical or MNFS. The MNFS-$$\\mathcal {A}$$A algorithm provides lower complexity compared to NFS-$$\\mathcal {A}$$A algorithm; for $$c_p\\in 0, 1.12] \\cup [1.45,3.15]$$cp\u22080,1.12]i\u00be?[1.45,3.15], the complexity of MNFS-$$\\mathcal {A}$$A is the same as that of the MNFS-Conjugation and for $$c_p\\notin 0, 1.12] \\cup [1.45,3.15]$$cpi\u00be?0,1.12]i\u00be?[1.45,3.15], the complexity of MNFS-$$\\mathcal {A}$$A is lower than that of all previous methods.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Indian Statistical Institute", "Indian Statistical Institute"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Palash Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar_0001:Palash", "Shashank Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh_0001:Shashank"], "pages": 30}
