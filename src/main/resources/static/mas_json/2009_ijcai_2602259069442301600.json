Central to it is a graph structure which models the geometrical and discriminant structure of the data manifold. When label information is available, it is usually incorporated into the graph structure by modifying the weights between data points. In this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm, called Constrained Graph Embedding, which considers the label information as additional constraints. Specifically, we constrain the space of the solutions that we explore only to contain embedding results that are consistent with the labels. Experimental results on two real life data sets illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Xiaofei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaofei", "Ming Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Ming", "Hujun Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Hujun"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
