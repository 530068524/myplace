{"title": "Calendar.help: Designing a Workflow-Based Scheduling Agent with Humans in the Loop.", "fields": ["delegation", "crowdsourcing", "two level scheduling", "dialog system", "workflow"], "abstract": "Although we may complain about meetings, they are an essential part of an information worker's work life. Consequently, busy people spend a significant amount of time scheduling meetings. We present Calendar.help, a system that provides fast, efficient scheduling through structured workflows. Users interact with the system via email, delegating their scheduling needs to the system as if it were a human personal assistant. Common scheduling scenarios are broken down using well-defined workflows and completed as a series of microtasks that are automated when possible and executed by a human otherwise. Unusual scenarios fall back to a trained human assistant executing an unstructured macrotask. We describe the iterative approach we used to develop Calendar.help, and share the lessons learned from scheduling thousands of meetings during a year of real-world deployments. Our findings provide insight into how complex information tasks can be broken down into repeatable components that can be executed efficiently to improve productivity.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Justin Cranshaw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cranshaw:Justin", "Emad Elwany.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elwany:Emad", "Todd Newman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Newman:Todd", "Rafal Kocielnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kocielnik:Rafal", "Bowen Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Bowen", "Sandeep Soni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soni:Sandeep", "Jaime Teevan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teevan:Jaime", "Andr\u00e9s Monroy-Hern\u00e1ndez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monroy=Hern=aacute=ndez:Andr=eacute=s"], "pages": 12}
