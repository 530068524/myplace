We analyze the label complexity of a simple mixed-initiative training mechanism using teaching dimension and active learning. We show that mixed-initiative training is advantageous compared to either computer-initiated (represented by active learning) or human-initiated classifier training. The advantage exists across all human teaching abilities, from optimal to completely unhelpful teachers. We further improve classifier training by educating the human teachers. This is done by showing, or explaining, optimal teaching sets to the human teachers. We conduct Mechanical Turk human experiments on two stylistic classifier training tasks to illustrate our approach.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jina Suh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suh:Jina", "Xiaojin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Xiaojin", "Saleema Amershi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amershi:Saleema"], "pages": 10}
