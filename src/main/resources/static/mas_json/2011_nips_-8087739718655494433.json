However, since density-ratio functions often possess high fluctuation, divergence estimation is still a challenging task in practice. In this paper, we propose to use relative divergences for distribution comparison, which involves approximation of relative density-ratios. Since relative density-ratios are always smoother than corresponding ordinary density-ratios, our proposed method is favorable in terms of the non-parametric convergence speed. Furthermore, we show that the proposed divergence estimator has asymptotic variance independent of the model complexity under a parametric setup, implying that the proposed estimator hardly overfits even with complex models. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "University of Tokyo", "Nagoya University", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Makoto Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Makoto", "Taiji Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Taiji", "Takafumi Kanamori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanamori:Takafumi", "Hirotaka Hachiya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hachiya:Hirotaka", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
