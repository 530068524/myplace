{"title": "Leveraging COUNT Information in Sampling Hidden Databases.", "fields": ["information system", "user interface", "decision tree", "algorithm design", "tuple"], "abstract": "A large number of online databases are hidden behind form-like interfaces which allow users to execute search queries by specifying selection conditions in the interface. Most of these interfaces return restricted answers (e.g., only top-k of the selected tuples), while many of them also accompany each answer with the COUNT of the selected tuples. In this paper, we propose techniques which leverage the COUNT information to ef?ciently acquire unbiased samples of the hidden database. We also discuss variants for interfaces which do not provide COUNTinformation. We conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the ef?ciency and accuracy of our techniques.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "George Washington University", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Arjun Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Arjun", "Nan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Nan", "Gautam Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das_0001:Gautam"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
