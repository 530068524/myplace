Popular dynamic languages such as JavaScript make testing or verifying such applications particularly challenging. In this paper, we present our ongoing work toward a methodology for automatically checking security properties in JavaScript code. Our main idea is to attach security annotations to values that encode properties of interest. We illustrate our idea using examples and, as an initial step in our line of work, we present a formalization of security annotations in a statically typed lambda calculus. As next steps, we will translate our annotations to a dynamically typed formalization of JavaScript such as \u03bb  JS   and implement a runtime checked type extension using code instrumentation for full JavaScript.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Royal Holloway, University of London", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "Royal Holloway, University of London"], "authors": ["Duncan Mitchell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitchell:Duncan", "L.
