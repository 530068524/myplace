Over 800,000 people have used Tribler since the project started in 2005. The Tribler P2P core supports BitTorrent-compatible downloading, video on demand and live streaming. Aside from a regular desktop GUI that runs on multiple OSes, it can be installed as a browser plug-in, currently used by Wikipedia. Aditionally, it runs on a 450~MHz processor, showcasing future TV support. We continuously work on extensions and test out novel research ideas within our user base, resulting in sub-second content search, a reputation system for rewarding upload, and channels for content publishing and spam prevention. Presently, 1200 channels have been created, enabling rich multimedia communities without requiring any server.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Niels Zeilemaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeilemaker:Niels", "Mihai Capota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capota:Mihai", "Arno Bakker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bakker:Arno", "Johan A.
