In this work, a novel context modelling framework is proposed without the need of any prior scene segmentation or context annotation. This is achieved by exploring a new polar geometric histogram descriptor for context representation. In order to quantify context, we formulate a new context risk function and a maximum margin context (MMC) model to solve the minimization problem of the risk function. Crucially, the usefulness and goodness of contextual information is evaluated directly and explicitly through a discriminant context inference method and a context confidence function, so that only reliable contextual information that is relevant to object detection is utilised. Experiments on PASCAL VOC2005 and i-LIDS datasets demonstrate that the proposed context modelling approach improves object detection significantly and outperforms a state-of-the-art alternative context model.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Wei-Shi Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Wei=Shi", "Shaogang Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Shaogang", "Tao Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Tao"], "pages": 8}
