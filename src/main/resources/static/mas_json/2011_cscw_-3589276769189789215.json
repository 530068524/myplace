It was experimentally demonstrated that the interruptions of AS are more acceptable than those during continuous work. Therefore, we constructed an algorithm that estimates the interruptibility of AS at three levels based on 19 selected indexes. The feasibility of the interruptibility estimation of AS was demonstrated by an estimation experiment using another dataset of 11 users.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology", "Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"], "authors": ["Takahiro Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Takahiro", "Kinya Fujita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujita:Kinya"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
