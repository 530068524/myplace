This gives prominence to spatial keyword queries that take into account both the locations and textual descriptions of content. Specifically, the relevance of an object to a query is measured by spatial-textual similarity that is based on both spatial proximity and textual similarity. In this paper, we define Reverse Spatial Textual k Nearest Neighbor (RSTkNN) query, i.e., finding objects that take the query object as one of their k most spatial-textual similar objects. Existing works on reverse kNN queries focus solely on spatial locations but ignore text relevance.   To answer RSTkNN queries efficiently, we propose a hybrid index tree called IUR-tree (Intersection-Union R-Tree) that effectively combines location proximity with textual similarity. Based on the IUR-tree, we design a branch-and-bound search algorithm. To further accelerate the query processing, we propose an enhanced variant of the IUR-tree called clustered IUR-tree and two corresponding optimization algorithms. Empirical studies show that the proposed algorithms offer scalability and are capable of excellent performance.", "citation": "Citations (143)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jiaheng Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jiaheng", "Ying Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Ying", "Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao"], "pages": 12}
