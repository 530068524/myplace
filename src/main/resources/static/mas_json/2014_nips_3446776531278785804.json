The shuffle ideal generated by a string set U is the collection of all strings containing some string u \u2208 U as a (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence. In spite of its apparent simplicity, the problem of learning a shuffle ideal from given data is known to be computationally intractable. In this paper, we study the PAC learn-ability of shuffle ideals and present positive results on this learning problem under element-wise independent and identical distributions and Markovian distributions in the statistical query model. A constrained generalization to learning shuffle ideals under product distributions is also provided. In the empirical direction, we propose a heuristic algorithm for learning shuffle ideals from given labeled strings under general unrestricted distributions. Experiments demonstrate the advantage for both efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Yale University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Dongqu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Dongqu"], "pages": 9}
