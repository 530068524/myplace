{"title": "Can You See Me Now?: How Field of View Affects Collaboration in Robotic Telepresence.", "fields": ["emerging technologies", "field of view", "situation awareness", "affordance", "teleoperation"], "abstract": "Robotic telepresence systems-videoconferencing systems that allow a remote user to drive around in another location-are an emerging technology for supporting geographically-distributed teams. Thus far, many of these systems rely on affordances designed for stationary systems, such as a single, narrow-view camera to provide vision for the remote user. Teleoperation has offered some solutions to this via an augmented field-of-view, but how these solutions support task outcomes in collaborative mobile telepresence tasks has yet to be understood. To investigate this, we conducted a three condition (field-of-view: narrow (45\u00b0) vs. wide-angle (180\u00b0) vs. panoramic (360\u00b0)) between-participants controlled laboratory experiment. We asked participants (N=24) to collaborate with a confederate via a robotic telepresence system while using one of these views in a redecoration task. Our results showed that wider views supported task efficiency and fewer collisions, but were perceived as more difficult to use.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Willow Garage"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Steven Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Steven", "Irene Rae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rae:Irene", "Bilge Mutlu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mutlu:Bilge", "Leila Takayama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takayama:Leila"], "pages": 10}
