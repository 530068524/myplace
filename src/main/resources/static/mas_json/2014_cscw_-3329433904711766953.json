While many studies have examined the effects of avatar attributes on users' behaviors and attitudes, few have explicitly tested how elements of avatar design relate to group collaboration satisfaction. The present study fills this gap using data from a field study with student groups in a collaborative virtual environment. Customizing an avatar to express identity was found to relate to more satisfaction with group collaboration, while similarity between the avatar and user's masculinity traits was related to less group collaboration satisfaction. Further, groups with fewer active members reported higher group collaboration satisfaction. Unexpectedly, number of customizations and using a face-similar were not related to group collaboration satisfaction, potentially due to limitations in the present design for which future research can account. These findings suggest that avatar design elements play an important role in collaborative virtual environments.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya"], "authors": ["Rabindra A.
