In this paper, we learn similarity from Flickr groups and use it to organize photos. Two images are similar if they are likely to belong to the same Flickr groups. Our approach is enabled by a fast Stochastic Intersection Kernel MAchine (SIKMA) training algorithm, which we propose. This proposed training method will be useful for many vision problems, as it can produce a classifier that is more accurate than a linear classifier, trained on tens of thousands of examples in two minutes. The experimental results show our approach performs better on image matching, retrieval, and classification than using conventional visual features.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Gang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0012:Gang", "Derek Hoiem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoiem:Derek", "David A.
