The key insight behind our work is that we can use the technique of static information flow to amplify the result of a single test execution over the set of all inputs and interleavings that affect the property being verified. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of test amplification for verifying race-freedom and determinism over a large number of standard GPU kernels, by showing that the result of verifying a single dynamic execution can be amplified over the massive space of possible data inputs and thread interleavings.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Alan Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Alan", "Manish Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Manish", "Yuvraj Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Yuvraj", "Rajesh Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta_0001:Rajesh", "Ranjit Jhala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jhala:Ranjit", "Sorin Lerner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerner:Sorin"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
