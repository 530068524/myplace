By controlling a parameter V in the algorithm, the backpressure algorithm can achieve an arbitrarily small utility optimality gap. However, this in turn brings in a large queue length at each node and hence causes large network delay. This phenomenon is known as the fundamental utility-delay tradeoff. The best known utility-delay tradeoff for general networks is [O(1/V), O(V)] and is attained by a backpressure algorithm based on a drift-pluspenalty technique. This may suggest that to achieve an arbitrarily small utility optimality gap, the existing backpressure algorithms necessarily yield an arbitrarily large queue length. However, this paper proposes a new backpressure algorithm that has a vanishing utility optimality gap, so utility converges to exact optimality as the algorithm keeps running, while queue lengths are bounded throughout by a finite constant. The technique uses backpressure and drift concepts with a new method for convex programming.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Hao Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0002:Hao", "Michael J.
