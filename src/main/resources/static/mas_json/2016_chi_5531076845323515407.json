Becoming fluent requires learning contextual information about how language should be used as well as word meanings and grammar. The majority of existing language learning applications provide only thin context around content. In this paper, we present work in Crystallize, a language learning game that combines traditional learning approaches with a situated learning paradigm by integrating a spaced-repetition system within a language learning roleplaying game. To facilitate long-term engagement with the game, we added a new quest paradigm, \"jobs,\" that allow a small amount of design effort to generate a large set of highly-scaffolded tasks that grow iteratively. A large-scale evaluation of the language learning game \"in the wild\" with a diverse set of 186 people revealed that the game was not only engaging players for extended amounts of time but that players learned an average of 8.7 words in an average of 40.5 minutes.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gabriel Culbertson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Culbertson:Gabriel", "Shiyu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shiyu", "Malte F.
