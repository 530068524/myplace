Few methods are available in games user research (GUR) to test formally how game designs work for players. In particular, the usefulness of user tests (UTs) for game designers has not been fully studied in the CHI community. We propose a novel GUR method called Biometric Storyboards (BioSt) and present a study demonstrating how a Classic UT and a BioSt UT both help designers create a better gameplay experience. In addition, we show that BioSt can help designers deliver significantly better visuals, more fun, and higher gameplay quality than designing without UTs and that classic UTs do not provide this significant advantage. Our interviews support the idea that BioSt provides more nuanced game design improvement. The design implication is that a game designed with the BioSt method will result in high gameplay quality.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["University of Sussex", "University of Ontario Institute of Technology", "University of Ontario Institute of Technology", "University of Sussex", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Pejman Mirza-Babaei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirza=Babaei:Pejman", "Lennart E.
