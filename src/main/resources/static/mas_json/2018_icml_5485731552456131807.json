We design and study the performance of a message passing algorithm that aims to solve this optimization problem. We consider the asymptotic setting $m,n \\rightarrow \\infty$, $m/n \\rightarrow \\delta$ and obtain sharp performance bounds, where $m$ is the number of measurements and $n$ is the signal dimension. We show that for complex signals the algorithm can perform accurate recovery with only $m=\\left ( \\frac{64}{\\pi^2}-4\\right)n\\approx 2.5n$ measurements. Also, we provide sharp analysis on the sensitivity of the algorithm to noise. We highlight the following facts about our message passing algorithm: (i) Adding $\\ell_2$ regularization to the non-convex loss function can be beneficial even in the noiseless setting; (ii) spectral initialization has marginal impact on the performance of the algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Junjie Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Junjie", "Ji Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ji", "Arian Maleki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maleki:Arian"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
