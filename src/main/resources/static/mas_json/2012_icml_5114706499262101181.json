However, it is usually unclear what type of latent task structure is the most appropriate for a given multitask learning problem. Ideally, the \"right\" latent task structure should be learned in a data-driven manner. We present a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian model that posits a mixture of factor analyzers structure on the tasks. The nonparametric aspect makes the model expressive enough to subsume many existing models of latent task structures (e.g, mean-regularized tasks, clustered tasks, low-rank or linear/non-linear subspace assumption on tasks, etc.). Moreover, it can also learn more general task structures, addressing the shortcomings of such models. We present a variational inference algorithm for our model. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets, on both regression and classification problems, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Utah", "State University of Campinas", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Alexandre Passos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Passos:Alexandre", "Piyush Rai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rai:Piyush", "Jacques Wainer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wainer:Jacques", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
