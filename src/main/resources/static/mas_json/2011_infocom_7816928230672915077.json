We have implemented a prototype of Kingfisher and have evaluated its efficacy on a laboratory cloud platform. Our experiments with varying application workloads demonstrate that Kingfisher is able to (i) decrease the cost of virtual server resources by as much as 24% compared to the current cost-unaware approach, (ii) reduce by an order of magnitude the time to transition to a new configuration through multiple elasticity mechanisms in the cloud, and (iii), illustrate the opportunity for further design alternatives which trade-off the cost of server resources with the time required to scale the application.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Upendra Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Upendra", "Prashant J.
