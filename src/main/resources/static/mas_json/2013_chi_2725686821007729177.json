Unfortunately, the related and equally important notion of  feedforward  has not been given as much consideration. Nevertheless, feedforward is a powerful design principle for bridging Norman's Gulf of Execution. We reframe feedforward by disambiguating it from related design principles such as feedback and perceived affordances, and identify new classes of feedforward. In addition, we present a reference framework that provides a means for designers to explore and recognize different opportunities for feedforward.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["University of Hasselt", "University of Hasselt", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "University of Hasselt"], "authors": ["Jo Vermeulen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vermeulen:Jo", "Kris Luyten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luyten:Kris", "Elise van den Hoven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoven:Elise_van_den", "Karin Coninx.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coninx:Karin"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
