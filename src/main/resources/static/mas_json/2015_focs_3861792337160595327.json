{"title": "A Holant Dichotomy: Is the FKT Algorithm Universal?", "fields": ["fkt algorithm", "schaefer s dichotomy theorem", "special case", "planar graph", "sat"], "abstract": "We prove a complexity dichotomy for complex-weighted Holant problems with an arbitrary set of symmetric constraint functions on Boolean variables. In the study of counting complexity, such as #CSP, there are problems which are #P-hard over general graphs but P-time solvable over planar graphs. A recurring theme has been that a holographic reduction [Val08] to FKT precisely captures these problems. This dichotomy answers the question: Is this a universal strategy? Surprisingly, we discover new planar tractable problems in the Holant framework (which generalizes #CSP) that are not expressible by a holographic reduction to FKT. In particular, the putative form of a dichotomy for planar Holant problems is false. Nevertheless, we prove a dichotomy for #CSP2, a variant of #CSP where every variable appears even times, that the presumed universality holds for #CSP2. This becomes an important tool in the proof of the full dichotomy, which refutes this universality in general. The full dichotomy says that the new P-time algorithms and the strategy of holographic reductions to FKT together are universal for these locally defined counting problems. As a special case of our new planar tractable problems, counting perfect matchings (#PM) over k-uniform hyper graphs is P-time computable when the incidence graph is planar and k a#x2265; =5. The same problem is #P-hard when k=3 or k=4, also a consequence of the dichotomy. More generally, over hyper graphs with specified hyper edge sizes and the same planarity assumption, #PM is P-time computable if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all hyper edge sizes is at least 5.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Jilin University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Jin-Yi Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Jin=Yi", "Zhiguo Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Zhiguo", "Heng Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0001:Heng", "Tyson Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Tyson"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 18}
