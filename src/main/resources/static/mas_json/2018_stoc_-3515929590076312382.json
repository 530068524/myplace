Our approximation guarantee is analyzed with respect to the standard LP relaxation, and thus our result confirms the conjectured constant integrality gap of that relaxation.     Our techniques build upon the constant-factor approximation algorithm for the special case of node-weighted metrics. Specifically, we give a generic reduction to structured instances that resemble but are more general than those arising from node-weighted metrics. For those instances, we then solve Local-Connectivity ATSP, a problem known to be equivalent (in terms of constant-factor approximation) to the asymmetric traveling salesman problem.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "London School of Economics and Political Science"], "authors": ["Ola Svensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svensson:Ola", "Jakub Tarnawski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarnawski:Jakub", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 A.
