Scout utilizes computing power of GPUs to achieve real-time query performance. The key idea behind Scout is a GPU-aware multi-version spatio-temporal index. The indexing and query processing modules of Scout are designed to complement the GPU hardware characteristics. Front end of Scout provides a user interface to submit queries and view results. Scout supports a variety of spatio-temporal queriesrange,  k -NN, and join. We use real data sets to demonstrate scalability and important features of Scout.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Harshada Chavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chavan:Harshada", "Mohamed F.
