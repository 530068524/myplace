{"title": "A Nonparametric Online Model for Air Quality Prediction.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "hyperparameter optimization", "probabilistic logic", "air quality index", "online model"], "abstract": "We introduce a novel method for the continuous online prediction of particulate matter in the air (more specifically, PM10 and PM2.5) given sparse sensor information. A nonparametric model is developed using Gaussian Processes, which eschews the need for an explicit formulation of internal - and usually very complex - dependencies between meteorological variables. Instead, it uses historical data to extrapolate pollutant values both spatially (in areas with no sensor information) and temporally (the near future). Each prediction also contains a respective variance, indicating its uncertainty level and thus allowing a probabilistic treatment of results. A novel training methodology (Structural Cross-Validation) is presented, which preserves the spatio-temporal structure of available data during the hyperparameter optimization process. Tests were conducted using a real-time feed from a sensor network in an area of roughly 50 \u00d7 80 km, alongside comparisons with other techniques for air pollution prediction. The promising results motivated the development of a smartphone applicative and a website, currently in use to increase the efficiency of air quality monitoring and control in the area.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["NICTA", "University of Sydney"], "authors": ["Vitor Campanholo Guizilini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guizilini:Vitor_Campanholo", "Fabio Tozeto Ramos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramos:Fabio_Tozeto"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
