{"title": "Discovering Theorems in Game Theory: Two-Person Games with Unique Pure Nash Equilibrium Payoffs.", "fields": ["epsilon equilibrium", "best response", "normal form game", "folk theorem", "symmetric game"], "abstract": "In this paper we provide a logical framework for two-person finite games in strategic form, and use it to design a computer program for discovering some classes of games that have unique pure Nash equilibrium payoffs. The classes of games that we consider are those that can be expressed by a conjunction of two binary clauses, and our program re-discovered Kats and Thisse@?s class of weakly unilaterally competitive two-person games, and came up with several other classes of games that have unique pure Nash equilibrium payoffs. It also came up with new classes of strict games that have unique pure Nash equilibria, where a game is strict if for both player different profiles have different payoffs.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Pingzhong Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Pingzhong", "Fangzhen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Fangzhen"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
