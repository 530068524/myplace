It is largely presumed that understandings of people\u00e2  s everyday interactions will be relatively easy to \u00e2  read off\u00e2   of such data and that this, in turn, poses a privacy threat. An ethnographic study of how people account for sensed data to third parties uncovers serious challenges to such ideas. The study reveals that the legibility of sensor data turns upon various orders of situated reasoning involved in articulating the data and making it accountable. Articulation work is indispensable to personal data sharing and raises real requirements for networked sensing systems premised on the harvesting of personal data.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Peter Tolmie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tolmie:Peter", "Andy Crabtree.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crabtree:Andy", "Tom Rodden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodden:Tom", "James A.
