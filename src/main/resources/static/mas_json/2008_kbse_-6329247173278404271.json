Model checking experiments were carried out on AJPF (agent JPF), our extension of Java PathFinder that incorporates the agent infrastructure layer, our unifying framework for agent programming languages. In our approach, properties are specified in a temporal language extended with (shallow) agent-related modalities. The framework then allows the verification of programs written in a variety of agent programming languages, thus removing the need for individual languages to implement their own verification framework. It even allows the verification of multi-agent systems comprised of agents developed in a variety of different (agent) programming languages. As an example, we also provide model checking results for the verification of a multi-agent system implementing a well-known task sharing protocol.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Durham University", "University of Liverpool", "Durham University", "University of Liverpool"], "authors": ["Rafael H.
