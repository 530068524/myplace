For claims based on structured data, we present a system to automatically assess the quality of claims (beyond their correctness) and counter misleading claims that cherry-pick data to advance their conclusions. The key insight is to model such claims as parameterized queries and consider how parameter perturbations affect their results. We demonstrate our system on claims drawn from U.S. congressional voting records, sports statistics, and publication records of database researchers.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["You Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:You", "Brett Walenz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walenz:Brett", "Peggy Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Peggy", "Andrew Shim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shim:Andrew", "Emre Sonmez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sonmez:Emre", "Pankaj K.
