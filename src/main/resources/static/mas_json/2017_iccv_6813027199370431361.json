Motivated to keep up with the constant increase in image size, with megapixel images becoming the norm, we aim at pushing the limits of efficient FFT-based techniques. Based on an analysis of traditional and more recent learning-based methods, we generalize existing discriminative approaches by using more powerful regularization, based on convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we propose a simple, yet effective, boundary adjustment method that alleviates the problematic circular convolution assumption, which is necessary for FFT-based deconvolution. We evaluate our approach on two common non-blind deconvolution benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results even when including methods which are computationally considerably more expensive.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Dresden University of Technology", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jakob Kruse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kruse:Jakob", "Carsten Rother.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rother:Carsten", "Uwe Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt_0001:Uwe"], "pages": 9}
