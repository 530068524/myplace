However, existing work on verifying refinement of concurrent programs either fails to prove the preservation of termination, allowing a diverging program to trivially refine any programs, or is difficult to apply in compositional thread-local reasoning. In this paper, we first propose a new simulation technique, which establishes termination-preserving refinement and is a congruence with respect to parallel composition. We then give a proof theory for the simulation, which is the first Hoare-style concurrent program logic supporting termination-preserving refinement proofs. We show two key applications of our logic, i.e., verifying linearizability and lock-freedom  together  for fine-grained concurrent objects, and verifying  full  correctness of optimizations of concurrent algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Yale University"], "authors": ["Hongjin Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Hongjin", "Xinyu Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Xinyu", "Zhong Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Zhong"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
