In cooperation with run-time inspection, our compiler derives transformed matrix representations and associated transformed code to implement a variety of representations targeting different architecture platforms. This systematic approach to combining code and data transformations on sparse computations, which extends a polyhedral transformation and code generation framework, permits the compiler to compose these transformations with other transformations to generate code that is on average within 5% and often exceeds manually-tuned, high-performance sparse matrix libraries CUSP and OSKI. Additionally, the compiler-generated inspector codes are on average 1.5 faster than OSKI and perform comparably to CUSP, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "Colorado State University"], "authors": ["Anand Venkat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkat:Anand", "Mary W.
