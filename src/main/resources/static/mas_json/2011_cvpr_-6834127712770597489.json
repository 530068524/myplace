Based on image intensity similarities between the input image and a learning dataset, an original strategy which does not require any non-rigid registration is presented. Following recent developments in non-local image denoising, the similarity between images is represented by a weighted graph computed from intensity-based distance between patches. Experiments on simulated and in-vivo MR images show that the proposed method is very successful in providing automated human brain labeling.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Rousseau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rousseau_0002:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Piotr A.
