People are able to share and manage their own resources in Web 2.0 Systems. The abundance of Web 2.0 resources in various media formats calls for better resource integration, intending to enrich user experience in both browsing and searching. Though the Web 2.0 resources are shown in various modalities, their tags act as an intuitive medium to connect resources together. However, tagging is by nature an ad hoc activity. They do often contain noises and are affected by the subjective inclination of taggers. Consequently, linking resources simply by tags will not be reliable. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for linking tagged resources to concepts extracted from Wikipedia, which has become a fairly reliable reference over the last few years. Compared to the tags, the concepts are therefore of higher quality. Empirical experiments were conducted, and the results validate the effectiveness of our framework.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Peking University", "NUS, Singapore, Singapore", "NUS, Singapore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Chen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chen", "Bing Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Bing", "Anthony K.
