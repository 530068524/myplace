We represent image partitions in terms of cellular complexes in order to make the duality between connected regions and their contours explicit. This allows us to formulate a graphical model with higher-order factors that represent the requirement that all contours must be closed. The model induces a probability measure on the space of all partitions, concentrated on perceptually meaningful segmentations. We give a complete polyhedral characterization of the resulting global inference problem in terms of the multicut polytope and efficiently compute global optima by a cutting plane method. Competitive results for the Berkeley segmentation benchmark confirm the consistency of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Bj\u00f6rn Andres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andres:Bj=ouml=rn", "J\u00f6rg H.
