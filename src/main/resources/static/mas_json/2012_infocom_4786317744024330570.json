We study broadcast in multiradio multichannel multi-hop wireless networks. Suppose through configuration, each node is already assigned with a transmission power level and a set of radio channels for receiving and forwarding data. Our problem is to select a forward scheme for broadcasting from a given source node and to minimize total energy consumption. This is a known NP-hard minimization problem. In this paper, we construct a polynomial-time (1.35 + \u2208)(1+ln(n\u22121))-approximation algorithm where n is the number of nodes in given network and \u2208 is any positive constant. We also show that there is no polynomial-time (\u03c1 ln n)-approximation for 0 < \u03c1 < 1 unless NP \u2286 DTIME(n O(log log n) ).", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Renmin University of China", "Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School", "Renmin University of China", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Changcun Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Changcun", "Deying Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Deying", "Hongwei Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Hongwei", "Huan Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Huan", "Yuexuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuexuan", "Wonjun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wonjun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
