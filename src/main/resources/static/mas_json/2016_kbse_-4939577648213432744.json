However, conducting that analysis manually is challenging because of the potentially large amount of data to analyze and the effort and expertise required. In this paper, we present ProcessPAIR, a novel tool designed to help developers analyze their performance data with less effort, by automatically identifying and ranking performance problems and potential root causes, so that subsequent manual analysis for the identification of deeper causes and improvement actions can be properly focused. The analysis is based on performance models defined manually by process experts and calibrated automatically from the performance data of many developers. We also show how ProcessPAIR was successfully applied for the Personal Software Process (PSP).
