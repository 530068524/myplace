{"title": "How do developers fix cross-project correlated bugs?: a case study on the GitHub scientific python ecosystem.", "fields": ["python", "empirical research", "bittorrent tracker", "software bug", "software"], "abstract": "GitHub, a popular social-software-development platform, has fostered a variety of software ecosystems where projects depend on one another and practitioners interact with each other. Projects within an ecosystem often have complex inter-dependencies that impose new challenges in bug reporting and fixing. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on cross-project correlated bugs, i.e., causally related bugs reported to different projects, focusing on two aspects: 1) how developers track the root causes across projects, and 2) how the downstream developers coordinate to deal with upstream bugs. Through manual inspection of bug reports collected from the scientific Python ecosystem and an online survey with developers, this study reveals the common practices of developers and the various factors in fixing cross-project bugs. These findings provide implications for future software bug analysis in the scope of ecosystem, as well as shed light on the requirements of issue trackers for such bugs.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Purdue University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Wanwangying Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Wanwangying", "Lin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0015:Lin", "Xiangyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiangyu", "Yuming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yuming", "Baowen Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Baowen"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
