{"title": "Learning the Architecture of Sum-Product Networks Using Clustering on Variables.", "fields": ["network architecture", "cluster analysis", "architecture", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The sum-product network (SPN) is a recently-proposed deep model consisting of a network of sum and product nodes, and has been shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art deep models on certain difficult tasks such as image completion. Designing an SPN network architecture that is suitable for the task at hand is an open question. We propose an algorithm for learning the SPN architecture from data. The idea is to cluster variables (as opposed to data instances) in order to identify variable subsets that strongly interact with one another. Nodes in the SPN network are then allocated towards explaining these interactions. Experimental evidence shows that learning the SPN architecture significantly improves its performance compared to using a previously-proposed static architecture.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Brigham Young University", "Brigham Young University"], "authors": ["Aaron W.
