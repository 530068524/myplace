To date, it remains the only known way of obtaining unbounded FHE. Unfortunately, bootstrapping is computationally very expensive, despite the great deal of effort that has been spent on improving its efficiency. The current state of the art, due to Gentry, Halevi, and Smart (PKC 2012), is able to bootstrap \u201cpacked\u201d ciphertexts (which encrypt up to a linear number of bits) in time only quasilinear O(\u03bb) = \u03bb \u00b7 logO(1) \u03bb in the security parameter. While this performance is asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic factors, the practical import is less clear: the procedure composes multiple layers of expensive and complex operations, to the point where it appears very difficult to implement, and its concrete runtime appears worse than those of prior methods (all of which have quadratic or larger asymptotic runtimes).", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jacob Alperin-Sheriff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alperin=Sheriff:Jacob", "Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 20}
