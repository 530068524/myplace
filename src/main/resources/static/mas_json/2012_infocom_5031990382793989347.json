While several such algorithms are ubiquitous, and use numerous random walk samples, the walks themselves have always been performed naively.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Google", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Atish Das Sarma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarma:Atish_Das", "Anisur Rahaman Molla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Molla:Anisur_Rahaman", "Gopal Pandurangan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandurangan:Gopal"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
