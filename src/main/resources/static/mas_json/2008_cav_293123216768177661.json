Our implementation combines the efficiency of linear programming for solving the arithmetic part with the efficiency of a SAT solver to reason about the boolean structure. We evaluate the efficiency of our tool on benchmarks from software verification. Binaries and the source code of  CSIsat are publicly available as free software.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Dirk Beyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beyer_0001:Dirk", "Damien Zufferey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zufferey:Damien", "Rupak Majumdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majumdar:Rupak"], "pages": 5}
