In particular, we are interested in asymmetric power assignments so that the induced communication graph has a good distance and energy stretch simultaneously, with additional optimization objectives: both minimizing the total energy consumption, interference level, hop-diameter, and maximizing the network lifetime. We present several power assignments with varying construction time complexity. The probability of our results converges to one as the number of network nodes, n, increases. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results for spanner construction in wireless ad-hoc networks with provable bounds for both, energy and distance, metrics simultaneously.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Michael Segal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segal_0001:Michael", "Hanan Shpungin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shpungin:Hanan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
