{"title": "WatchThru: Expanding Smartwatch Displays with Mid-air Visuals and Wrist-worn Augmented Reality.", "fields": ["multimedia", "human computer interaction", "augmented reality", "wearable technology", "smartwatch"], "abstract": "We introduce WatchThru, an interactive method for extended wrist-worn display on commercially-available smartwatches. To address the limited visual and interaction space, WatchThru expands the device into 3D through a transparent display. This enables novel interactions that leverage and extend smartwatch glanceability. We describe three novel interaction techniques,  Pop-up Visuals ,  Second Perspective  and  Peek-through , and discuss how they can complement interaction on current devices. We also describe two types of prototypes that helped us to explore standalone interactions, as well as, proof-of-concept AR interfaces using our platform.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "Google", "University of Hasselt", "University of Bremen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dirk Wenig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wenig:Dirk", "Johannes Sch\u00f6ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=ning:Johannes", "Alex Olwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olwal:Alex", "Mathias Oben.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oben:Mathias", "Rainer Malaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malaka:Rainer"], "pages": 6}
