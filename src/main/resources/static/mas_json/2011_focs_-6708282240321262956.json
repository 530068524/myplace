The result is obtained by combining two techniques: (i) An Inner PCP based on the {\\it point versus subspace} test for linear functions. The testis analyzed Fourier analytically. (ii) The Outer/Inner PCP composition that relies on a certain {\\it sub-code covering} property for Hadamard codes. This is a new and essentially black-box method to translate a {\\it codeword test}for Hadamard codes to a {\\it consistency test}, leading to a full PCP construction. As an application, we show that unless NP has quasi-polynomial time deterministic algorithms, the Quadratic Programming Problem is in approximable within factor $(\\log n)^{1/6 - o(1)}$.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["New York University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash", "Muli Safra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Safra:Muli"], "pages": 10}
