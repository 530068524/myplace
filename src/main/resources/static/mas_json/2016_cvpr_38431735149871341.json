Our network has a very deep recursive layer (up to 16 recursions). Increasing recursion depth can improve performance without introducing new parameters for additional convolutions. Albeit advantages, learning a DRCN is very hard with a standard gradient descent method due to exploding/ vanishing gradients. To ease the difficulty of training, we propose two extensions: recursive-supervision and skip-connection. Our method outperforms previous methods by a large margin.", "citation": "Citations (290)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jiwon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jiwon", "Jung Kwon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jung_Kwon", "Kyoung Mu Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyoung_Mu"], "pages": 9}
