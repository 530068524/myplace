We present finite sample statistical consistency guarantees for Quick Shift on mode and cluster recovery under mild distributional assumptions. We then apply our results to construct a consistent modal regression algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Heinrich Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Heinrich"], "pages": 10}
