Our proposed techniques enable an order of magnitude reduction in the number of queries and time needed to learn a botnet C &C protocol compared to classic algorithms (from days to hours for inferring the MegaD C &C protocol). We also show that the computed protocol state machines enable formal analysis for botnet defense, including finding the weakest links in a protocol, uncovering protocol design flaws, inferring the existence of unobservable communication back-channels among botnet servers, and finding deviations of protocol implementations which can be used for fingerprinting. We validate our technique by inferring the protocol state-machine from Postfix's SMTP implementation and comparing the inferred state-machine to the SMTP standard. Further, our experimental results offer new insights into MegaD's C &C, showing our technique can be used as a powerful tool for defense against botnets.", "citation": "Citations (163)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Chia Yuan Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Chia_Yuan", "Domagoj Babic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babic:Domagoj", "Eui Chul Richard Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Eui_Chul_Richard", "Dawn Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Dawn"], "pages": 14}
