{"title": "An interactive belt-worn badge with a retractable string-based input mechanism.", "fields": ["computer hardware", "wearable computer", "embedded system", "string", "computer science"], "abstract": "In this paper we explore a new type of wearable computing device, an interactive identity badge. An embedded LCD presents dynamic information to the wearer and interaction is facilitated by sensing movement of the retractable string which attaches the unit to the wearer's belt. This form-factor makes it possible to interact using a single hand, providing lightweight and immediate access to a variety of information when it's not convenient to pick up, unlock and interact directly with a device like a smartphone. In this paper we present our prototype interactive badge, demonstrate the underlying technology and describe a number of usage scenarios and interaction techniques", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Norman Pohl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pohl:Norman", "Steve Hodges.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hodges:Steve", "John Helmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmes:John", "Nicolas Villar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villar:Nicolas", "Tim Paek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paek:Tim"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
