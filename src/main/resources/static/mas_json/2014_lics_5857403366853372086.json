{"title": "The complexity of admissibility in Omega-regular games.", "fields": ["graph", "decision problem", "omega", "game theory", "iterated function"], "abstract": "Iterated admissibility is a well-known and important concept in classical game theory, e.g. to determine  rational  behaviors in multi-player matrix games. As recently shown by Berwanger, this concept can be soundly extended to infinite games played on graphs with  \u03c9 -regular objectives. In this paper, we study the algorithmic properties of this concept for such games. We settle the exact complexity of natural decision problems on the set of strategies that survive iterated elimination of dominated strategies. As a byproduct of our construction, we obtain automata which recognize all the possible outcomes of such strategies.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "University of Paris"], "authors": ["Romain Brenguier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brenguier:Romain", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raskin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raskin:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois", "Mathieu Sassolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sassolas:Mathieu"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
