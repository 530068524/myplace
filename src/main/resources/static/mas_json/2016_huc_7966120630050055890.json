Questions are prompted during everyday life using an individual's mobile device, thereby reducing recall bias and increasing validity over other self-report methods such as retrospective recall. We describe a microinteraction-based EMA method (\"micro\" EMA, or \u03bcEMA) using smartwatches, where all EMA questions can be answered with a quick glance and a tap -- nearly as quickly as checking the time on a watch. A between-subjects, 4-week pilot study was conducted where \u03bcEMA on a smartwatch (n=19) was compared with EMA on a phone (n=14). Despite an =8 times increase in the number of interruptions, \u03bcEMA had a significantly higher compliance rate, completion rate, and first prompt response rate, and \u03bcEMA was perceived as less distracting. The temporal density of data collection possible with \u03bcEMA could prove useful in ubiquitous computing studies.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Stephen S.
