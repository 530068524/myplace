Our approach is to augment a known time-varying Dirichlet process that ties together a sequence of infinite Gaussian mixture models, one per action potential waveform observation, with an interspike-interval-dependent likelihood that prohibits refractory period violations. We demonstrate this model by showing results from sorting two publicly available neural data recordings for which a partial ground truth labeling is known.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jan Gasthaus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gasthaus:Jan", "Frank D.
