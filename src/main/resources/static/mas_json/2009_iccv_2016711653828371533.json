{"title": "Extending continuous cuts: Anisotropic metrics and expansion moves.", "fields": ["coarea formula", "potts model", "cut", "analogy", "maximum flow problem"], "abstract": "The concept of graph cuts is by now a standard method for all sorts of low level vision problems. Its popularity is largely due to the fact that globally or near globally optimal solutions can be computed using efficient max flow algorithms. On the other hand it has been observed that this method may suffer from metrication errors. Recent work has begun studying continuous versions of graph cuts, which give smaller metrication errors. Another advantage is that continuous cuts are straightforward to parallelize. In this paper we extend the class of functionals that can be optimized in the continuous setting to include anisotropic TV-norms. We show that there is a so called coarea formula for these functionals making it possible to minimize them by solving a convex problem. We also show that the concept of a-expansion moves can be reformulated to fit the continuous formulation, and we derive approximation bounds in analogy with the discrete case. A continuous version of the Potts model for multi-class segmentation problems is presented, and it is shown how to obtain provably good solutions using continuous a-expansions.  1", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Lund University", "Lund University", "Lund University", "Lund University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Carl Olsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olsson:Carl", "Martin Byr\u00f6d.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Byr=ouml=d:Martin", "Niels Chr.
