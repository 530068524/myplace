The fragments are extracted and clustered by a preprocessor from a database of known protein structures. Assembling fragments into a complete conformation is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem solved using CLP. The approach makes use of a simplified C\u03b1-side chain centroid protein model, that offers efficiency and a good approximation for space filling. The approach adapts existing energy models for protein representation and applies a large neighboring search (LNS) strategy. The results show the feasibility and efficiency of the method, and the declarative nature of the approach simplifies the introduction of additional knowledge and variations of the model.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Parma", "University of Udine", "University of Udine", "New Mexico State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Alessandro Dal Pal\u00f9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pal=ugrave=:Alessandro_Dal", "Agostino Dovier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dovier:Agostino", "Federico Fogolari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fogolari:Federico", "Enrico Pontelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pontelli:Enrico"], "pages": 6}
