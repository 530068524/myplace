Our solver employs a new algorithm for a constraint language that is expressive enough for widespread applicability. Specifically, our language covers all the main string operations, such as those in JavaScript. The algorithm first makes use of a symbolic representation so that membership in a set defined by a regular expression can be encoded as string equations. Secondly, there is a constraint-based generation of instances from these symbolic expressions so that the total number of instances can be limited. We evaluate S3 on a well-known set of practical benchmarks, demonstrating both its robustness (more definitive answers) and its efficiency (about 20 times faster) against the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Minh-Thai Trinh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trinh:Minh=Thai", "Duc-Hiep Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Duc=Hiep", "Joxan Jaffar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaffar:Joxan"], "pages": 12}
