While prior solutions require the user to hold a wireless transmitter, or require custom wireless hardware, or can only determine a pre-defined set of hand gestures, this paper introduces WiDraw, the first hand motion tracking system using commodity WiFi cards, and without any user wearables. WiDraw harnesses the Angle-of-Arrival values of incoming wireless signals at the mobile device to track the user's hand trajectory. We utilize the intuition that whenever the user's hand occludes a signal coming from a certain direction, the signal strength of the angle representing the same direction will experience a drop. Our software prototype using commodity wireless cards can track the user's hand with a median error lower than 5 cm. We use WiDraw to implement an in-air handwriting application that allows the user to draw letters, words, and sentences, and achieves a mean word recognition accuracy of 91%.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "Hewlett-Packard", "University at Buffalo", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Li Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0003:Li", "Souvik Sen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sen:Souvik", "Dimitrios Koutsonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koutsonikolas:Dimitrios", "Kyu-Han Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kyu=Han"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
