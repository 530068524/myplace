{"title": "A Characterization Theorem for a Modal Description Logic.", "fields": ["multimodal logic", "accessibility relation", "modal \u03bc calculus", "s5", "normal modal logic"], "abstract": "Modal description logics feature modalities that capture dependence of knowledge on parameters such as time, place, or the information state of agents. E.g., the logic S5-ALC combines the standard description logic ALC with an S5-modality that can be understood as an epistemic operator or as representing (undirected) change. This logic embeds into a corresponding modal first-order logic S5-FOL. We prove a modal characterization theorem for this embedding, in analogy to results by van Benthem and Rosen relating ALC to standard first-order logic: We show that S5-ALC with only local roles is, both over finite and over unrestricted models, precisely the bisimulation invariant fragment of S5-FOL, thus giving an exact description of the expressive power of S5-ALC with only local roles.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"], "authors": ["Paul Wild.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wild:Paul", "Lutz Schr\u00f6der.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schr=ouml=der:Lutz"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
