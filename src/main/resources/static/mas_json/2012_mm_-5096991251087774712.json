This paper introduces an open source, named VIREO-VH, which provides end-to-end support for creating hyperlinks to thread and visualize collections of videos. The software components include video pre-processing, bag-of-words based inverted file indexing for scalable near-duplicate keyframe search, localization of partial near-duplicate segments, and galaxy visualization of video collection. The open source has been internally used by VIREO research team since 2007, and was evolved over years based on experiences through developing various multimedia applications.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "University Tunk ...
