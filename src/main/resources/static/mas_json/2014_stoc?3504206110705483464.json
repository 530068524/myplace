Similarly, any graph whose adjacency matrix has rank  r  has chromatic number at most 2  O (\u221ar \u00b7 log(r)) . This gives a nearly quadratic improvement in the dependence on the rank over previous results.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar"], "pages": 5}
