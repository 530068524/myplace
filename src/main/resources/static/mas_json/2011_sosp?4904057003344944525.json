A key feature behind Walter is a new property called  Parallel Snapshot Isolation  (PSI). PSI allows Walter to replicate data asynchronously, while providing strong guarantees within each site. PSI precludes write-write conflicts, so that developers need not worry about conflict-resolution logic. To prevent write-write conflicts and implement PSI, Walter uses two new and simple techniques: preferred sites and counting sets. We use Walter to build a social networking application and port a Twitter-like application.", "citation": "Citations (333)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "Microsoft", "New York University"], "authors": ["Yair Sovran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sovran:Yair", "Russell Power.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Power:Russell", "Marcos K.
