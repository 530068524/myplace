{"title": "A Market Clearing Solution for Social Lending.", "fields": ["pareto efficiency", "diversification", "overnight market", "market clearing", "interest rate"], "abstract": "The social lending market, with over a billion dollars in loans, is a two-sided matching market where borrowers specify demands and lenders specify total budgets and their desired interest rates from each acceptable borrower. Because different borrowers correspond to different risk-return profiles, lenders have preferences over acceptable borrowers; a borrower prefers lenders in order of the interest rates they offer to her. We investigate the question of what is a computationally feasible, 'good', allocation to clear this market.\n\nWe design a strongly polynomial time algorithm for computing a Pareto-efficient stable outcome in a two-sided many-to-many matching market with indifferences, and use this to compute an allocation for the social lending market that satisfies the properties of stability -- a standard notion of fairness in two-sided matching markets -- and Pareto efficiency; and additionally addresses envy-freeness amongst similar borrowers and risk diversification for lenders.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ning Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ning", "Arpita Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Arpita"], "pages": 6}
