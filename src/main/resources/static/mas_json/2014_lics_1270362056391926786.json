With these extensions, type theory can be used to construct proofs of homotopy-theoretic theorems, in a way that is very amenable to computer-checked proofs in proof assistants such as Coq and Agda. In this paper, we give a computer-checked construction of  Eilenberg-MacLane spaces . For an abelian group  G , an Eilenberg-MacLane space  K ( G , n ) is a space (type) whose  n   th   homotopy group is G, and whose homotopy groups are trivial otherwise. These spaces are a basic tool in algebraic topology; for example, they can be used to build spaces with specified homotopy groups, and to define the notion of cohomology with coefficients in  G . Their construction in type theory is an illustrative example, which ties together many of the constructions and methods that have been used in homotopy type theory so far.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Wesleyan University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Daniel R.
