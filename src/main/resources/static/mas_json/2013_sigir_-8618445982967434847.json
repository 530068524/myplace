Some stability/robustness metrics have been proposed. However, they are often defined separately from the mean effectiveness metric. Consequently, there is a lack of a unified formulation of effectiveness, stability and overall retrieval quality (considering both). In this paper, we present a unified formulation based on the bias-variance decomposition. Correspondingly, a novel evaluation methodology is developed to evaluate the effectiveness and stability in an integrated manner. A case study applying the proposed methodology to evaluation of query language modeling illustrates the usefulness and analytical power of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Tianjin University", "Tianjin University", "University College London", "Tianjin University"], "authors": ["Peng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Peng", "Dawei Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song_0001:Dawei", "Jun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jun", "Yuexian Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Yuexian"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
