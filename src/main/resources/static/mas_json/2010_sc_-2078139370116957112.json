Unfortunately, these capabilities are neither easily accessible to programmers, nor exploited to their maximum potential by current language, compiler, or runtime frameworks. We present Strider, a runtime framework for optimizing compilers on multi-core processors with software- managed memories. Strider transparently optimizes grouping, decomposition, and scheduling of explicit software-managed accesses to multi-dimensional arrays in nested loops, given a high- level specification of loops and their data access patterns. In particular, Strider contributes new methods to improve temporal locality, optimize the critical path of scheduling data transfers for multi-stride accesses in regular nested parallel loops, and distribute accesses between cores. The prototype of Strider on the IBM Cell processor performs competitively to hand-optimized code and better than contemporary language frameworks, in both non-trivial parallel applications and important application kernels.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Inst. of Comput ...
