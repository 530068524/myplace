We consider several caching policies (including a very attractive one, called  k -LRU), taking into account the effects of temporal locality. In the case of interconnected caches, our approach allows us to do better than the Poisson approximation commonly adopted in prior work. Our results, validated against simulations and trace-driven experiments, provide interesting insights into the performance of caching systems.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "departments": ["University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "Dipt. di Elettr ... o, Turin, Italy", "Dipt. di Inf.,  ... o, Turin, Italy", "Dipt. di Elettr ... o, Turin, Italy"], "authors": ["Valentina Martina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martina:Valentina", "Michele Garetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garetto:Michele", "Emilio Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Emilio"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
