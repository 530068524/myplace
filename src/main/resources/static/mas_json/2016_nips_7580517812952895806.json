The assortment optimization problem focuses on determining the revenue/profit maximizing subset of products from a large universe of products; it is an important decision that is commonly faced by retailers in determining what to offer their customers. There are two key challenges: (a) the Mallows distribution lacks a closed-form expression (and requires summing an exponential number of terms) to compute the choice probability and, hence, the expected revenue/profit per customer; and (b) finding the best subset may require an exhaustive search. Our key contributions are an efficiently computable closed-form expression for the choice probability under the Mallows model and a compact mixed integer linear program (MIP) formulation for the assortment problem.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "New York University", "University of Haifa"], "authors": ["Antoine D\u00e9sir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=eacute=sir:Antoine", "Vineet Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Vineet", "Srikanth Jagabathula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jagabathula:Srikanth", "Danny Segev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segev:Danny"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
