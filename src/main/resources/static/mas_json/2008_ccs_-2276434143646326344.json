{"title": "Reconsidering physical key secrecy: teleduplication via optical decoding.", "fields": ["physical security", "bit", "secrecy", "digital image", "lock"], "abstract": "The access control provided by a physical lock is based on the assumption that the information content of the corresponding key is private --- that duplication should require either possession of the key or a priori knowledge of how it was cut. However, the ever-increasing capabilities and prevalence of digital imaging technologies present a fundamental challenge to this privacy assumption. Using modest imaging equipment and standard computer vision algorithms, we demonstrate the effectiveness of physical key teleduplication --- extracting a key's complete and precise bitting code at a distance via optical decoding and then cutting precise duplicates. We describe our prototype system, Sneakey, and evaluate its effectiveness, in both laboratory and real-world settings, using the most popular residential key types in the U.S.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Benjamin Laxton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laxton:Benjamin", "Kai Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kai", "Stefan Savage.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savage:Stefan"], "pages": 10}
