{"title": "Robust Entity Clustering via Phylogenetic Inference.", "fields": ["gibbs sampling", "phylogenetic tree", "inference", "copying", "coreference"], "abstract": "Entity clustering must determine when two named-entity mentions refer to the same entity. Typical approaches use a pipeline architecture that clusters the mentions using fixed or learned measures of name and context similarity. In this paper, we propose a model for cross-document coreference resolution that achieves robustness by learning similarity from unlabeled data. The generative process assumes that each entity mention arises from copying and optionally mutating an earlier name from a similar context. Clustering the mentions into entities depends on recovering this copying tree jointly with estimating models of the mutation process and parent selection process. We present a block Gibbs sampler for posterior inference and an empirical evaluation on several datasets.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nicholas Andrews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrews:Nicholas", "Jason Eisner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisner:Jason", "Mark Dredze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dredze:Mark"], "pages": 11}
