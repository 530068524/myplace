These models only capture the local context, of up to a few thousands tokens. In this paper, we propose an extension of continuous cache models, which can scale to larger contexts. In particular, we use a large scale non-parametric memory component that stores all the hidden activations seen in the past. We leverage recent advances in approximate nearest neighbor search and quantization algorithms to store millions of representations while searching them efficiently. We conduct extensive experiments showing that our approach significantly improves the perplexity of pre-trained language models on new distributions, and can scale efficiently to much larger contexts than previously proposed local cache models.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Edouard Grave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grave:Edouard", "Moustapha Ciss\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciss=eacute=:Moustapha", "Armand Joulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joulin:Armand"], "pages": 11}
