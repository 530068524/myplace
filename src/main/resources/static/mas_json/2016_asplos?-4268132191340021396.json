{"title": "CoGENT: Verifying High-Assurance File System Implementations.", "fields": ["implementation", "class implementation file", "domain specific language", "mathematical proof", "correctness"], "abstract": "We present an approach to writing and formally verifying high-assurance file-system code in a restricted language called Cogent, supported by a certifying compiler that produces C code, high-level specification of Cogent, and translation correctness proofs. The language is strongly typed and guarantees absence of a number of common file system implementation errors. We show how verification effort is drastically reduced for proving higher-level properties of the file system implementation by reasoning about the generated formal specification rather than its low-level C code. We use the framework to write two Linux file systems, and compare their performance with their native C implementations.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Sidney Amani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amani:Sidney", "Alex Hixon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hixon:Alex", "Zilin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zilin", "Christine Rizkallah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rizkallah:Christine", "Peter Chubb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chubb:Peter", "Liam O'Connor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Connor:Liam", "Joel Beeren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beeren:Joel", "Yutaka Nagashima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagashima:Yutaka", "Japheth Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Japheth", "Thomas Sewell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sewell:Thomas", "Joseph Tuong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuong:Joseph", "Gabriele Keller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keller:Gabriele", "Toby C.
