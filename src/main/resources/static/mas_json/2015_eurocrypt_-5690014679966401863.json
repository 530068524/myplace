{"title": "SPHINCS: Practical Stateless Hash-Based Signatures.", "fields": ["hash function", "public key cryptography", "stateless protocol", "quantum computer", "key", "post quantum cryptography"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a high-security post-quantum stateless hash-based signature scheme that signs hundreds of messages per second on a modern 4-core 3.5GHz Intel CPU. Signatures are 41 KB, public keys are 1 KB, and private keys are 1 KB. The signature scheme is designed to provide long-term \\(2^{128}\\) security even against attackers equipped with quantum computers. Unlike most hash-based designs, this signature scheme is stateless, allowing it to be a drop-in replacement for current signature schemes.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Least Authority"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Daniel J.
