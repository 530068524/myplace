The algorithm runs in tilde O(N) time. Our algorithm extends to higher dimensions, leading to sample complexity of Od(klog N), which is optimal up to constant factors for any d = O(1). These are the first sample optimal algorithms for these problems. A preliminary experimental evaluation indicates that our algorithm has empirical sampling complexity comparable to that of other recovery methods known in the literature, while providing strong provable guarantees on the recovery quality.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Piotr Indyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Indyk:Piotr", "Michael Kapralov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapralov:Michael"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
