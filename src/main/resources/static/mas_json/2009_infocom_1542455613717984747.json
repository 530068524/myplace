A fundamental capability of all such systems is that of inter-cache coordination, which can be divided into two main types: explicit and implicit coordination. While the former allows for greater control over resource allocation, the latter does not suffer from the additional communication overhead needed for coordination. In this paper, we consider a network in which each router has a local cache that caches files passing through it. By additionally storing minimal information regarding caching history, we de- velop a simple content caching, location, and routing systems that adopts an implicit, transparent, and best-effort approach towards caching. Though only best effort, the policy outperforms classic policies that allow explicit coordination between caches.", "citation": "Citations (217)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Elisha J.
