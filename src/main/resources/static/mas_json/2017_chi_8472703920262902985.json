{"title": "Cito: An Actuated Smartwatch for Extended Interactions.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "fidelity", "computer science", "smartwatch", "simulation"], "abstract": "We propose and explore actuating a smartwatch face to enable extended interactions. Five face movements are defined: rotation, hinging, translation, rising, and orbiting. These movements are incorporated into interaction techniques to address limitations of a fixed watch face. A 20-person study uses concept videos of a passive low fidelity prototype to confirm the usefulness of the actuated interaction techniques. A second 20-person study uses 3D rendered animations to access social acceptability and perceived comfort for different actuation dynamics and usage contexts. Finally, we present Cito, a high-fidelity proof-of-concept hardware prototype that investigates technical challenges.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Dartmouth College", "South China University of Technology", "University of Waterloo", "Dartmouth College"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jun Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Jun", "Lan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Lan", "Daniel Vogel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogel_0001:Daniel", "Xing-Dong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xing=Dong"], "pages": 15}
