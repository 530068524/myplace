However, a straight switch from GSP to VCG incurs significant revenue loss for the search engine. We introduce a transitional mechanism which encourages advertisers to update their bids to their valuations, while mitigating revenue loss. In this setting, it is easier to propose first a payment function rather than an allocation function, so we give a general framework which guarantees incentive compatibility by requiring that the payment functions satisfy two specific properties. Finally, we analyze the revenue impacts of our mechanism on a sample of Bing data.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Edinburgh", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yoram Bachrach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachrach:Yoram", "Sofia Ceppi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceppi:Sofia", "Ian A.
