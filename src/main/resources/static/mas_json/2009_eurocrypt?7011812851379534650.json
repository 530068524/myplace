Our results imply that any attempt at breaking RSA without factoring  N  will be non-generic and hence will have to manipulate the particular bit-representation of the input in ***  N  . This provides new evidence that breaking RSA may be equivalent to factoring the modulus.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "National University of Singapore", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Divesh Aggarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aggarwal:Divesh", "Ueli M.
