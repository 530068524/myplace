{"title": "Parallel random numbers: as easy as 1, 2, 3.", "fields": ["massively parallel", "testu01", "pseudorandom number generator", "cuda", "threefish"], "abstract": "Most pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) scale poorly to massively parallel high-performance computation because they are designed as sequentially dependent state transformations. We demonstrate that independent, keyed transformations of counters produce a large alternative class of PRNGs with excellent statistical properties (long period, no discernable structure or correlation). These  counter-based  PRNGs are ideally suited to modern multi-core CPUs, GPUs, clusters, and special-purpose hardware because they vectorize and parallelize well, and require little or no memory for state. We introduce several counter-based PRNGs: some based on cryptographic standards (AES, Threefish) and some completely new (Philox). All our PRNGs pass rigorous statistical tests (including TestU01's BigCrush) and produce at least 2 64  unique parallel streams of random numbers, each with period 2 128  or more. In addition to essentially unlimited parallel scalability, our PRNGs offer excellent single-chip performance: Philox is faster than the CURAND library on a single NVIDIA GPU.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "departments": ["D.
