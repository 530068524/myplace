{"title": "Robust Execution of BDI Agent Programs by Exploiting Synergies Between Intentions.", "fields": ["scheduling", "reactive planning", "overhead", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "A key advantage the reactive planning approach adopted by BDI-based agents is the ability to recover from plan execution failures, and almost all BDI agent programming languages and platforms provide some form of failure handling mechanism. In general, these consist of simply choosing an alternative plan for the failed subgoal (e.g., JACK, Jadex). In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to recovering from execution failures that relies on exploiting positive interactions between an agent's intentions. A positive interaction occurs when the execution of an action in one intention assists the execution of actions in other intentions (e.g., by (re)establishing their preconditions). We have implemented our approach in a scheduling algorithm for BDI agents which we call SP . The results of a preliminary empirical evaluation of SP suggest our approach out-performs existing failure handling mechanisms used by state-of-the-art BDI languages. Moreover, the computational overhead of SP is modest.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "RMIT University"], "authors": ["Yuan Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Yuan", "Brian Logan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Logan:Brian", "John Thangarajah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thangarajah:John"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
