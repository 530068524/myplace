{"title": "Field trial of Tiramisu: crowd-sourcing bus arrival times to spur co-design.", "fields": ["critical mass", "co design", "social computing", "public service", "service design"], "abstract": "Crowd-sourcing social computing systems represent a new material for HCI designers. However, these systems are difficult to work with and to prototype, because they require a critical mass of participants to investigate social behavior. Service design is an emerging research area that focuses on how customers co-produce the services that they use, and thus it appears to be a great domain to apply this new material. To investigate this relationship, we developed Tiramisu, a transit information system where commuters share GPS traces and submit problem reports. Tiramisu processes incoming traces and generates real-time arrival time predictions for buses. We conducted a field trial with 28 participants. In this paper we report on the results and reflect on the use of field trials to evaluate crowd-sourcing prototypes and on how crowd sourcing can generate co-production between citizens and public services.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Swarthmore, Swa ... nnsylvania, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["John Zimmerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmerman:John", "Anthony Tomasic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomasic:Anthony", "Charles Garrod.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garrod:Charles", "Daisy Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Daisy", "Chaya Hiruncharoenvate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hiruncharoenvate:Chaya", "Rafae Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz:Rafae", "Nikhil Ravi Thiruvengadam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thiruvengadam:Nikhil_Ravi", "Yun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yun", "Aaron Steinfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinfeld:Aaron"], "pages": 10}
