The key insight of the approach is that quantization methods, in particular product quantization, perform poorly when there is large variance in the norms of the data points. This is a common scenario for real- world datasets, especially when doing product quantization of residuals obtained from coarse vector quantization. To address this issue, we propose a multiscale formulation where we learn a separate scalar quantizer of the residual norm scales. All parameters are learned jointly in a stochastic gradient descent framework to minimize the overall quantization error. We provide theoretical motivation for the proposed technique and conduct comprehensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall over existing state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Xiang Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xiang", "Ruiqi Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Ruiqi", "Ananda Theertha Suresh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suresh:Ananda_Theertha", "Sanjiv Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Sanjiv", "Daniel N.
