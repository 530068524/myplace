Packets are adaptively routed in the network according to congestion information, which makes the algorithm resilient to traffic and topology changes. However, the back-pressure algorithm requires routers to maintain a separate queue for each destination, which precludes its implementation in large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a distributed cluster-based back-pressure routing algorithm that retains the adaptability of back-pressure routing while significantly reducing the number of queues that have to be maintained at each node.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Iowa State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Lei Ying.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ying:Lei", "R.
