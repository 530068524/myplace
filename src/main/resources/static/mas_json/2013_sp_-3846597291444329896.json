{"title": "Efficient Garbling from a Fixed-Key Blockcipher.", "fields": ["random permutation", "distributed computing", "computer security", "cryptography", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We advocate schemes based on fixed-key AES as the best route to highly efficient circuit-garbling. We provide such schemes making only one AES call per garbled-gate evaluation. On the theoretical side, we justify the security of these methods in the random-permutation model, where parties have access to a public random permutation. On the practical side, we provide the Just Garble system, which implements our schemes. Just Garble evaluates moderate-sized garbled-circuits at an amortized cost of 23.2 cycles per gate (7.25 nsec), far faster than any prior reported results.", "citation": "Citations (208)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Viet Tung Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Viet_Tung", "Sriram Keelveedhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keelveedhi:Sriram", "Phillip Rogaway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogaway:Phillip"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2013", "pages": 15}
