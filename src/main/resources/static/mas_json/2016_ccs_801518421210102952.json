{"title": "iLock: Immediate and Automatic Locking of Mobile Devices against Data Theft.", "fields": ["data theft", "microphone", "password", "adversary", "lock"], "abstract": "Mobile device losses and thefts are skyrocketing. The sensitive data hosted on a lost/stolen device are fully exposed to the adversary. Although password-based authentication mechanisms are available on mobile devices, many users reportedly do not use them, and a device may be lost/stolen while in the unlocked mode. This paper presents the design and evaluation of iLock, a secure and usable defense against data theft on a lost/stolen mobile device. iLock automatically, quickly, and accurately recognizes the user's physical separation from his/her device by detecting and analyzing the changes in wireless signals. Once significant physical separation is detected, the device is immediately locked to prevent data theft. iLock relies on acoustic signals and requires at least one speaker and one microphone that are available on most COTS (commodity-off-the-shelf) mobile devices. Extensive experiments on Samsung Galaxy S5 show that iLock can lock the device with negligible false positives and negatives.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Tao", "Yimin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yimin", "Jingchao Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jingchao", "Xiaocong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xiaocong", "Yanchao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanchao"], "pages": 12}
