{"title": "Selective Encoding for Abstractive Sentence Summarization.", "fields": ["sentence", "information flow", "automatic summarization", "recurrent neural network", "encoder"], "abstract": "We propose a selective encoding model to extend the sequence-to-sequence framework for abstractive sentence summarization. It consists of a sentence encoder, a selective gate network, and an attention equipped decoder. The sentence encoder and decoder are built with recurrent neural networks. The selective gate network constructs a second level sentence representation by controlling the information flow from encoder to decoder. The second level representation is tailored for sentence summarization task, which leads to better performance. We evaluate our model on the English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and MSR abstractive sentence summarization datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed selective encoding model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Qingyu Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Qingyu", "Nan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Nan", "Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming"], "pages": 10}
