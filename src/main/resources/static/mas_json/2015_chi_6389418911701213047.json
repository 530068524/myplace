{"title": "Exploring Gesture Sonification to Support Reflective Craft Practice.", "fields": ["sonification", "multimedia", "craft", "reflective practice", "gesture"], "abstract": "Much of the knowing employed in skilled craft practice is difficult to communicate solely through written or verbal description. Consequently, the reflection and development of a craft practice in this manner may miss important nuances of practitioners' skills and experiences. We created digital technologies to sonify (using audio to perceptualize data) a group of craft practitioners' gestures to explore how we can aid their reflection in and on their craft, and consequently develop it. Over a number of workshops, the design of these sonifications were iterated based on how the practitioners responded to them. We found that direct sonification of gesture (sounds generated directly from motion sensor data) helped practitioners understand and reflect upon their own and each other's practice, encouraged discussion and enabled modification of craft technique.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "University of York", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Thomas Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith_0001:Thomas", "Simon J.
