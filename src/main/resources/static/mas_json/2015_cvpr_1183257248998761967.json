In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised DA approach based on both subspace alignment and selection of landmarks similarly distributed between the two domains. Those landmarks are selected so as to reduce the discrepancy between the domains and then are used to non linearly project the data in the same space where an efficient subspace alignment (in closed-form) is performed. We carry out a large experimental comparison in visual domain adaptation showing that our new method outperforms the most recent unsupervised DA approaches.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Rahaf Aljundi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aljundi:Rahaf", "R\u00e9mi Emonet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emonet:R=eacute=mi", "Damien Muselet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muselet:Damien", "Marc Sebban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebban:Marc"], "pages": 8}
