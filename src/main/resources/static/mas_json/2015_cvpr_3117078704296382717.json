Our work is motivated by the need for automatically generating 3D models of interior scenes, in which glass structures are common. These large structures are often invisible to cameras or even our human visual system. Existing 3D reconstruction methods for transparent objects are usually not applicable in such a room-size reconstruction setting. Our approach augments a regular depth camera (e.g., the Microsoft Kinect camera) with a single ultrasonic sensor, which is able to measure distance to any objects, including transparent surfaces. We present a novel sensor fusion algorithm that first segments the depth map into different categories such as opaque/transparent/infinity (e.g., too far to measure) and then updates the depth map based on the segmentation outcome. Our current hardware setup can generate only one additional point measurement per frame, yet our fusion algorithm is able to generate satisfactory reconstruction results based on our probabilistic model. We highlight the performance in many challenging indoor benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Kentucky", "Nanjing University", "University of Kentucky", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mao Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Mao", "Yu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yu", "Ruigang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ruigang", "Dinesh Manocha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manocha:Dinesh"], "pages": 9}
