With a virtual touch screen, the user's direct-touch interactions are allowed in much the same way as a conventional touch screen, but the absence of haptic feedback and physical constraint leads to poor user performance. To overcome this issue, we developed a wearable haptic device, called HapThimble. It provides various types of haptic feedback (tactile, pseudo-force, and vibrotactile) to the user's fingertip and mimics physical buttons based on force-penetration depth curves. We conducted three experiments with HapThimble. The first experiment confirmed that HapThimble could increase a users' performance when conducting clicking and dragging tasks. The second experiment revealed that users could differentiate between six types of haptic feedback, rendered based on different force-penetration depth curves obtained using HapThimble. Last, we conducted a test to investigate the similarity between the physical buttons and the mimicked haptic buttons and obtained a 90.3% success rate.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Hwan Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hwan", "Minhwan Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Minhwan", "Woohun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Woohun"], "pages": 12}
