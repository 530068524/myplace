WeSpace has been developed for a population of scientists who frequently meet in small groups for data exploration and visualization. It provides a low overhead walk-up and share environment for users with their own personal applications and laptops. We present our year-long effort from initial ethnographic studies, to iterations of design, development and user testing, to the current experiences of these scientists carrying out their collaborative research in the WeSpace. We shed light on the utility, the value of the multi-touch table, the manifestation, usage patterns and the changes in their workflow that WeSpace has brought about.", "citation": "Citations (176)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories", "Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Daniel Wigdor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigdor:Daniel", "Hao Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Hao", "Clifton Forlines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forlines:Clifton", "Michelle Borkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borkin:Michelle", "Chia Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chia"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
