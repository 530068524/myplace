{"title": "Termination Analysis by Learning Terminating Programs.", "fields": ["normalization property", "portfolio", "finite set", "termination analysis", "lasso"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to termination analysis. In a first step, the analysis uses a program as a black-box which exhibits only a finite set of sample traces. Each sample trace is infinite but can be represented by a finite lasso. The analysis can \"learn\" a program from a termination proof for the lasso, a program that is terminating by construction. In a second step, the analysis checks that the set of sample traces is representative in a sense that we can make formal. An experimental evaluation indicates that the approach is a potentially useful addition to the portfolio of existing approaches to termination analysis.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Matthias Heizmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heizmann:Matthias", "Jochen Hoenicke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoenicke:Jochen", "Andreas Podelski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podelski:Andreas"], "pages": 17}
