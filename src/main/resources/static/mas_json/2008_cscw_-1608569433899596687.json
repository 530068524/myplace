Designing CSCW tools to support coordination in these settings, however, requires an improved under-standing of the constraints and conflicts that impede effective collaboration. We present findings from a study of distributed collaborations between academic surgeons and biomedical engineering researchers. These two groups differ significantly in their work priorities and institutional contexts, but are nonetheless able to work together and co-ordinate effectively. They accomplish this via human mediation, frequent  ad hoc  communication, and optimizing the use of their limited face-to-face interaction opportunities.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Saeko Nomura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nomura:Saeko", "Jeremy P.
