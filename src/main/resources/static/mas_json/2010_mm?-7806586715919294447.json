{"title": "Assisted news reading with automated illustration.", "fields": ["forgetting", "computer vision", "multimedia", "information processing", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "We all had the problem of forgetting about what we just read a few sentences before. This comes from the problem of attention and is more common with children and elderly. People feel either bored or distracted by something more interesting. This paper proposes an application to help people reading news by illustrating the news story. The application provides mechanisms to (1) select the best illustration for each scene and (2) to select the set of illustrations to improve the story sequence. The application proposed in this technical demo aims at improving the user's attention when reading news articles. The application implements several information processing techniques to generate an audio-visual presentation of the text news article.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Universidade Nova de Lisboa", "Universidade Nova de Lisboa", "Universidade Nova de Lisboa"], "authors": ["Diogo Delgado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delgado:Diogo", "Jo\u00e3o Magalh\u00e3es.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magalh=atilde=es:Jo=atilde=o", "Nuno Correia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Correia_0001:Nuno"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
