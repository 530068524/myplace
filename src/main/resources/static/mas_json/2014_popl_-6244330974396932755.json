{"title": "Abstract effects and proof-relevant logical relations.", "fields": ["semantic equivalence", "effect system", "existential quantification", "denotational semantics", "setoid"], "abstract": "We give a denotational semantics for a region-based effect system that supports type abstraction in the sense that only externally visible effects need to be tracked: non-observable internal modifications, such as the reorganisation of a search tree or lazy initialisation, can count as 'pure' or 'read only'. This 'fictional purity' allows clients of a module to validate soundly more effect-based program equivalences than would be possible with previous semantics. Our semantics uses a novel variant of logical relations that maps types not merely to partial equivalence relations on values, as is commonly done, but rather to a proof-relevant generalisation thereof, namely setoids. The objects of a setoid establish that values inhabit semantic types, whilst its morphisms are understood as proofs of semantic equivalence. The transition to proof-relevance solves twoawkward problems caused by naive use of existential quantification in Kripke logical relations, namely failure of admissibility and spurious functional dependencies.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Federal University of Para\u00edba"], "authors": ["Nick Benton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benton:Nick", "Martin Hofmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofmann_0001:Martin", "Vivek Nigam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nigam:Vivek"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2014", "pages": 14}
