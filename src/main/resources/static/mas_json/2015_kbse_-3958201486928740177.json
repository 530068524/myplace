{"title": "Pseudogen: A Tool to Automatically Generate Pseudo-Code from Source Code.", "fields": ["programming language implementation", "code generation", "write only language", "assembly language", "second generation programming language"], "abstract": "Understanding the behavior of source code written in an unfamiliar programming language is difficult. One way to aid understanding of difficult code is to add corresponding pseudo-code, which describes in detail the workings of the code in a natural language such as English. In spite of its usefulness, most source code does not have corresponding pseudo-code because it is tedious to create. This paper demonstrates a tool Pseudogen that makes it possible to automatically generate pseudo-code from source code using statistical machine translation (SMT). Pseudogen currently supports generation of English or Japanese pseudo-code from Python source code, and the SMT framework makes it easy for users to create new generators for their preferred source code/pseudo-code pairs.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Hiroyuki Fudaba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fudaba:Hiroyuki", "Yusuke Oda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oda:Yusuke", "Koichi Akabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akabe:Koichi", "Graham Neubig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neubig:Graham", "Hideaki Hata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hata:Hideaki", "Sakriani Sakti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakti:Sakriani", "Tomoki Toda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toda:Tomoki", "Satoshi Nakamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakamura_0001:Satoshi"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 6}
