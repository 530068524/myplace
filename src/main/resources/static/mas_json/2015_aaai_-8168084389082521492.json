{"title": "Named Entity Recognition in Travel-Related Search Queries.", "fields": ["named entity recognition", "web query classification", "test set", "vertical search", "f1 score"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of named entity recognition (NER) in travel-related search queries. NER is an important step toward a richer understanding of user-generated inputs in information retrieval systems. NER in queries is challenging due to minimal context and few structural clues. NER in restricted-domain queries is useful in vertical search applications, for example following query classification in general search. This paper describes an efficient machine learning-based solution for the high-quality extraction of semantic entities from query inputs in a restricted-domain information retrieval setting. We apply a conditional random field (CRF) sequence model to travel-domain search queries and achieve high-accuracy results. Our approach yields an overall F1 score of 86.4% on a held-out test set, outperforming a baseline score of 82.0% on a CRF with standard features. The resulting NER classifier is currently in use in a real-life travel search engine.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Expedia, Inc., Bellevue, WA", "Expedia, Inc., Bellevue, WA", "Expedia, Inc., Bellevue, WA", "Expedia, Inc., Bellevue, WA", "Expedia, Inc., Bellevue, WA"], "authors": ["Brooke Cowan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cowan:Brooke", "Sven Zethelius.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zethelius:Sven", "Brittany Luk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luk:Brittany", "Teodora Baras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baras:Teodora", "Prachi Ukarde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ukarde:Prachi", "Daodao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Daodao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
