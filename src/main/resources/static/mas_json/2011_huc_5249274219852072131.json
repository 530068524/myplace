{"title": "Data broadcasting using mobile FM radio: design, realization and application.", "fields": ["mobile web", "mobile search", "codec", "digital broadcasting", "radio data system"], "abstract": "In this work, we offer a novel system, MicroStation (\u03bcStation) that allows ubiquitous data broadcasting applications using the FM radio on mobile devices such as smartphones. \u03bcStation includes two key modules to enable data broadcasting based on existing mobile FM radio hardware. Channel Selector assigns different FM channels to neighboring \u03bcStation broadcasters to avoid collision and guides \u03bcStation listeners to find their broadcasting of interest. Data Codec realizes bit-level communication between mobile devices through existing FM radio hardware. We describe an implementation of \u03bcStation on the Nokia N900 smartphone, and provide low-level APIs and services to support application development. We also demonstrate two representative applications: Facebook-FM and Sync-Flash. These applications demonstrate the capability of \u03bcStation to readily enable a new class of ubiquitous data broadcasting applications on mobile devices.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Motorola"], "authors": ["Hang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Hang", "Ahmad Rahmati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahmati:Ahmad", "Ardalan Amiri Sani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sani:Ardalan_Amiri", "Lin Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong_0001:Lin", "Jehan Wickramasuriya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wickramasuriya:Jehan", "Venu Vasudevan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasudevan:Venu"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
