In the last decade, dependency modeling techniques were developed under a specific distribution of classifiers. This paper proposes a new framework to model the dependency between features without any assumption on feature/classifier distribution. In this paper, we prove that feature dependency can be modeled by a linear combination of the posterior probabilities under some mild assumptions. Based on the linear combination property, two methods, namely Linear Classifier Dependency Modeling (LCDM) and Linear Feature Dependency Modeling (LFDM), are derived and developed for dependency modeling in classifier level and feature level, respectively. The optimal models for LCDM and LFDM are learned by maximizing the margin between the genuine and imposter posterior probabilities. Both synthetic data and real datasets are used for experiments. Experimental results show that LFDM outperforms all existing combination methods.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Andy Jinhua Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Andy_Jinhua", "Pong Chi Yuen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuen:Pong_Chi"], "pages": 8}
