In this paper, we propose a new model and evaluate its performance on 61 newly abstinent smokers for detecting a first lapse. We use two wearable sensors --- breathing pattern from respiration and arm movements from 6-axis inertial sensors worn on wrists. In 10-fold cross-validation on 40 hours of training data from 6 daily smokers, our model achieves a recall rate of 96.9%, for a false positive rate of 1.1%. When our model is applied to 3 days of post-quit data from 32 lapsers, it correctly pinpoints the timing of first lapse in 28 participants. Only 2 false episodes are detected on 20 abstinent days of these participants. When tested on 84 abstinent days from 28 abstainers, the false episode per day is limited to 1/6.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["University of Memphis", "University of Dhaka", "University of Memphis", "University of Memphis", "University of Memphis"], "authors": ["Nazir Saleheen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saleheen:Nazir", "Amin Ahsan Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Amin_Ahsan", "Syed Monowar Hossain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hossain:Syed_Monowar", "Hillol Sarker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarker:Hillol", "Soujanya Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Soujanya", "Benjamin M.
