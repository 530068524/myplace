{"title": "Query Suggestion with Feedback Memory Network.", "fields": ["information needs", "machine learning", "user modeling", "artificial neural network", "search engine"], "abstract": "This paper presents, Feedback Memory Network (FMN), which models user interactions with the search engine for query suggestion. Besides modeling the queries issued by the user,  FMN also considers user\u2019s feedback on the search results. It converts user\u2019s browsing and click actions to the attention over the top-ranked documents, combines them into the feedback memories of the query, and better models the user\u2019s information needs. The feedback memories and the query sequence are then combined to suggest queries by the sequence-to-sequence neural network. Modeling user feedback makes it possible to suggest diverse queries for the same query sequence if users have preferred different search results, which indicate different information needs. Our experiments on the search log from a Chinese commercial search engine showed the stable and robust advantages of FMN. Especially when the feedback is richer or more informative, FMN provides more diverse and accurate suggestions, which is exceptionally helpful for ambiguous sessions where more information is needed to infer the search intents.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Bin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Bin", "Chenyan Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Chenyan", "Maosong Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Maosong", "Zhiyuan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Zhiyuan"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
