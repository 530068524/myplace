While this approach improves the scalability of matrix factorization, its performance is not satisfactory. We present a matrix co-factorization method where compressed measurements and a small number of uncompressed measurements are jointly decomposed, sharing a factor matrix. We evaluate the performance of three matrix factorization methods in terms of Cramer-Rao bounds, including: (1) matrix factorization on uncompressed data (MF); (2) matrix factorization on compressed data (CS-MF); (3) matrix co-factorization on compressed and uncompressed data (CS-MCF). Numerical experiments demonstrate that CS-MCF improves the performance of CS-MF, emphasizing the useful behavior of exploiting side information (a small number of uncompressed measurements).", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jiho Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Jiho", "Seungjin Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Seungjin"], "pages": 8}
