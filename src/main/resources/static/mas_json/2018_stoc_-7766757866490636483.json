Using the optimal-transport duality framework of Daskalakis, Deckelbaum, and Tzamos [2013, 2015], we derive the first lower bound for this problem \u2014 of \u03a9(1/\u221ce), even when the values for the two goods are drawn i.i.d. from \u201dnice\u201d distributions, establishing how to reason about approximately optimal mechanisms via this duality framework. This bound implies, for any fixed number of goods, a tight bound of \u0398(log1/e) on the minimum deterministic communication complexity guaranteed to suffice for running some approximately revenue-maximizing mechanism, thereby completely resolving this problem. As a secondary result, we show that under standard economic assumptions on distributions, the above upper bound of Hart and Nisan [2013] can be strengthened to  O (1/e 2 ).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Yannai A.
