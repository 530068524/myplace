Although it is promising, there still exist many security and privacy challenges. In this paper, we present an incentive and privacy-aware data dissemination (IPAD) scheme for OPPNETs, not only to exploit how to protect mobile node's identity privacy, location privacy and social profile privacy, but also to provide a secure incentive for privacy-aware data dissemination. Through extensive incentive analysis, we show that only if a source provides a secure incentive strategy, can a data packet be efficiently disseminated in OPPNETs.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Ontario Institute of Technology", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Rongxing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Rongxing", "Xiaodong Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xiaodong", "Zhiguo Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Zhiguo", "Bin Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao_0003:Bin", "Xuemin (Sherman) Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xuemin_=Sherman="], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
