{"title": "A Pseudo-Bayesian Algorithm for Robust PCA.", "fields": ["data matrix", "bayesian probability", "subspace topology", "machine learning", "outlier"], "abstract": "Commonly used in many applications, robust PCA represents an algorithmic attempt to reduce the sensitivity of classical PCA to outliers. The basic idea is to learn a decomposition of some data matrix of interest into low rank and sparse components, the latter representing unwanted outliers. Although the resulting problem is typically NP-hard, convex relaxations provide a computationally-expedient alternative with theoretical support. However, in practical regimes performance guarantees break down and a variety of non-convex alternatives, including Bayesian-inspired models, have been proposed to boost estimation quality. Unfortunately though, without additional a priori knowledge none of these methods can significantly expand the critical operational range such that exact principal subspace recovery is possible. Into this mix we propose a novel pseudo-Bayesian algorithm that explicitly compensates for design weaknesses in many existing non-convex approaches leading to state-of-the-art performance with a sound analytical foundation.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["KAIST", "Osaka University", "KAIST", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Tae-Hyun Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Tae=Hyun", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki", "In-So Kweon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kweon:In=So", "David P.
