{"title": "Accelerating I/O Forwarding in IBM Blue Gene/P Systems.", "fields": ["i o scheduling", "p system", "benchmark", "supercomputer", "instruction set"], "abstract": "Current leadership-class machines suffer from a significant imbalance between their computational power and their I/O bandwidth. I/O forwarding is a paradigm that attempts to bridge the increasing performance and scalability gap between the compute and I/O components of leadership-class machines to meet the requirements of data-intensive applications by shipping I/O calls from compute nodes to dedicated I/O nodes. I/O forwarding is a critical component of the I/O subsystem of the IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer currently deployed at several leadership computing facilities. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the existing I/O forwarding mechanisms for BG/P and identify the performance bottlenecks in the current design. We augment the I/O forwarding with two approaches: I/O scheduling using a work-queue model and asynchronous data staging. We evaluate the efficacy of our approaches using microbenchmarks and application-level benchmarks on leadership class systems.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "departments": ["Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Venkatram Vishwanath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vishwanath:Venkatram", "Mark Hereld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hereld:Mark", "Kamil Iskra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iskra:Kamil", "Dries Kimpe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimpe:Dries", "Vitali A.
