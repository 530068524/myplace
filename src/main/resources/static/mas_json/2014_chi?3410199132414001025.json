The layout of the comic is used to visualize this data as heat maps and explore patterns of users' recollections. We describe the theoretical justification for this based upon previous work in narrative visualizations, interactive stories and comics. Having tested the comic with school boys aged 11-12; we saw patterns in the data that complement other research in both interactive stories and visualizations. We argue that the heat maps helped identify these patterns, which have implications for future designs and analyses of interactive visual and/or narrative media.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Birmingham", "University of Birmingham"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Andrews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrews:Daniel", "Chris Baber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baber:Chris"], "pages": 10}
