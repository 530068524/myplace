The first study replicates findings by Bonnie John [7]: the rates at which novice modelers made correct recommendations (88.1%) and supported them (68.2%) are close to the values in John's study (91.7% and 75.1%, respectively). A follow-on study of novice modelers on the same task without CogTool produced sig-nificantly lower values. CogTool improves the UI design recommendations made by novices.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kyung Wha Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Kyung_Wha", "Robert St. Amant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amant:Robert_St="], "pages": 4}
