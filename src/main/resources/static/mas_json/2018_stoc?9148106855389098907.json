Our first main result is that distribution-free  k -junta testing can be performed, with one-sided error, by an adaptive algorithm that uses O( k  2 )/\u0454 queries (independent of  n ). Complementing this, our second main result is a lower bound showing that any non-adaptive distribution-free  k -junta testing algorithm must make \u03a9(2  k /3 ) queries even to test to accuracy \u0454=1/3. These bounds establish that while the optimal query complexity of non-adaptive  k -junta testing is 2 \u0398( k ) , for adaptive testing it is poly( k ), and thus show that adaptivity provides an exponential improvement in the distribution-free query complexity of testing juntas.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Zhengyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhengyang", "Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xi", "Rocco A.
