{"title": "A time- and message-optimal distributed algorithm for minimum spanning trees.", "fields": ["distributed minimum spanning tree", "graph", "minimum spanning tree", "distributed algorithm", "spanning tree"], "abstract": "This paper presents a randomized (Las Vegas) distributed algorithm that constructs a minimum spanning tree (MST) in weighted networks with optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) time and message complexity. This algorithm runs in \ufffd ( D  + \u00e2   n ) time and exchanges \ufffd ( m ) messages (both with high probability), where  n  is the number of nodes of the network,  D  is the diameter, and  m  is the number of edges. This is the first distributed MST algorithm that matches  simultaneously  the time lower bound of I\u00a9( D  + \u00e2   n ) [Elkin, SIAM J. Comput. 2006] and the message lower bound of I\u00a9( m ) [Kutten et al., J. ACM 2015], which both apply to randomized Monte Carlo algorithms.   The prior time and message lower bounds are derived using two completely different graph constructions; the existing lower bound construction that shows one lower bound does not work for the other. To complement our algorithm, we present a new lower bound graph construction for which any distributed MST algorithm requires both I\u00a9( D  + \u00e2   n ) rounds and I\u00a9( m ) messages.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Houston", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "University of Houston"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Gopal Pandurangan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandurangan:Gopal", "Peter Robinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robinson_0002:Peter", "Michele Scquizzato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scquizzato:Michele"], "pages": 14}
