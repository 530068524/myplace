{"title": "The Iterated Random Permutation Problem with Applications to Cascade Encryption.", "fields": ["partial permutation", "random permutation statistics", "bit reversal permutation", "pseudorandom permutation", "permutation"], "abstract": "We introduce and study the iterated random permutation problem, which asks how hard it is to distinguish, in a black-box way, the r-th power of a random permutation from a uniformly random permutation of a set of size N. We show that this requires \\(\\varOmega (N)\\) queries (even for a two-sided, adaptive adversary). As a direct application of this result, we show that cascading a block cipher with the same key cannot degrade its security (as a pseudorandom permutation) more than negligibly.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["ANSSI", "ANSSI"], "authors": ["Brice Minaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minaud:Brice", "Yannick Seurin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seurin:Yannick"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 17}
