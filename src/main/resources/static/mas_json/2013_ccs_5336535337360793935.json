This is usually the result of either conditional branching in code or differences in input size. Using CSS default filters, we have discovered a variety of timing attacks that work in multiple browsers and devices. The first attack exploits differences in time taken to render various DOM trees. This knowledge can be used to determine boolean values such as whether or not a user has an account with a particular website. Second, we introduce pixel stealing. Pixel stealing attacks can be used to sniff user history and read text tokens.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Robert Kotcher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotcher:Robert", "Yutong Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Yutong", "Pranjal Jumde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jumde:Pranjal", "Collin Jackson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jackson:Collin"], "pages": 8}
