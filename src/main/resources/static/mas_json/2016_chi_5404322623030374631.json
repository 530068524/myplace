{"title": "Finding the Way to OSM Mapping Practices: Bounding Large Crisis Datasets for Qualitative Investigation.", "fields": ["data mining", "bounding overwatch", "content analysis", "geographic information system", "interpersonal communication"], "abstract": "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the most widely used volunteer geographic information system. Although it is increasingly relied upon during humanitarian response as the most up-to-date, accurate, or accessible map of affected areas, the behavior of the mappers who contribute to it is not well understood. In this paper, we explore the work practices and interactions of volunteer mappers operating in the high-tempo, high-volume context of disasters. To do this, we built upon and expanded prior network analysis techniques to select high-value portions of the vast OSM data for further qualitative analysis. We then performed detailed content analysis of the identified activity and, where possible, conducted interviews with the participants. This research allowed the identification of seven distinct mapping practices that can be classified according to dimensions of time, space, and interpersonal interaction. Our work represents a baseline for future research about how OSM crisis mapping practices have evolved over time.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Marina Kogan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kogan:Marina", "T.
