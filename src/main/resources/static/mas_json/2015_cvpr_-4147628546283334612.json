A special structure formed by basic and nonbasic variables in each stage of the algorithm is identified and utilized to perform the whole iterative process combinatorially over the input energy minimization graph rather than algebraically over the simplex tableau. This leads to a new efficient solver. We demonstrate that for some computer vision instances it performs even better than methods reducing binary energy minimization to finding maximum flow in a network.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Daniel Prusa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prusa:Daniel"], "pages": 9}
