Prominent examples of problematic update directions include those used in both Goodfellow's original GAN and the WGAN-GP. To formally describe an optimal update direction, we introduce a theoretical framework which allows the derivation of requirements on both the divergence and corresponding method for determining an update direction. These requirements guarantee unbiased mini-batch updates in the direction of steepest descent. We propose a novel divergence which approximates the Wasserstein distance while regularizing the critic's first order information. Together with an accompanying update direction, this divergence fulfills the requirements for unbiased steepest descent updates. We verify our method, the First Order GAN, with CelebA image generation and set a new state of the art on the One Billion Word language generation task.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Zalando Research", "Zalando Research", "Zalando Research", "JKU Linz"], "authors": ["Calvin Seward.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seward:Calvin", "Thomas Unterthiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unterthiner:Thomas", "Urs Bergmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergmann:Urs", "Nikolay Jetchev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jetchev:Nikolay", "Sepp Hochreiter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hochreiter:Sepp"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
