{"title": "Parameter Identification for Markov Models of Biochemical Reactions.", "fields": ["markov property", "variable order markov model", "continuous time markov chain", "markov kernel", "markov model"], "abstract": "We propose a numerical technique for parameter inference in Markov models of biological processes. Based on time-series data of a process we estimate the kinetic rate constants by maximizing the likelihood of the data. The computation of the likelihood relies on a dynamic abstraction of the discrete state space of the Markov model which successfully mitigates the problem of state space largeness. We compare two variants of our method to state-of-the-art, recently published methods and demonstrate their usefulness and efficiency on several case studies from systems biology.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Aleksandr Andreychenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andreychenko:Aleksandr", "Linar Mikeev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mikeev:Linar", "David Spieler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spieler:David", "Verena Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Verena"], "pages": 16}
