In this paper we prove a tight lower bound for the RMR complexity of deadlock-free randomized mutual exclusion algorithms in both the CC and the DSM model with atomic registers and compare & swap objects and an adaptive adversary. Our lower bound establishes that an adaptive adversary can schedule n processes in such a way that each enters the critical section once, and the total number of RMRs is \u03a9(n log n/log log n) in expectation. This matches an upper bound of Hendler and Woelfel (2011).", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["George Giakkoupis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giakkoupis:George", "Philipp Woelfel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woelfel:Philipp"], "pages": 20}
