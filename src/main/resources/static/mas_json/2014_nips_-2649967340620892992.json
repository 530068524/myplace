We provide finite sample convergence guarantees for general distributions in the misspecified model. This is the first active learner for this setting that provably can improve over passive learning. Unlike other learning settings (such as classification), in regression the passive learning rate of O(1/\u220a) cannot in general be improved upon. Nonetheless, the so-called 'constant' in the rate of convergence, which is characterized by a distribution-dependent risk, can be improved in many cases. For a given distribution, achieving the optimal risk requires prior knowledge of the distribution. Following the stratification technique advocated in Monte-Carlo function integration, our active learner approaches the optimal risk using piecewise constant approximations.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Sivan Sabato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabato:Sivan", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "pages": 9}
