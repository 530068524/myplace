{"title": "PCA by Determinant Optimisation has no Spurious Local Optima.", "fields": ["machine learning", "spurious relationship", "principal component analysis", "mathematical optimization", "local optimum"], "abstract": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) finds the best linear representation for data and is an indispensable tool in many learning tasks. Classically, principal components of a dataset are interpreted as the directions that preserve most of its \"energy\", an interpretation that is theoretically underpinned by the celebrated Eckart-Young-Mirsky Theorem. There are yet other ways of interpreting PCA that are rarely exploited in practice, largely because it is not known how to reliably solve the corresponding non-convex optimisation programs. In this paper, we consider one such interpretation of principal components as the directions that preserve most of the \"volume\" of the dataset. Our main contribution is a theorem that shows that the corresponding non-convex program has no spurious local optima, and is therefore amenable to many convex solvers. We also confirm our findings numerically.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "The Turing Institute", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Raphael A.
