This problem has an unbounded competitive ratio even for very restricted settings. In this paper we show that if we allow the machines of the online algorithm to have e more speed than those of the offline algorithm then we can get an O((1+e -1 ) 2 )-competitive algorithm. Our algorithm schedules jobs preemptively but without migration. However, we compare our solution to an offline algorithm which allows migration. Our analysis uses a potential function argument which can also be extended to give a simpler and better proof of the randomized immediate dispatch algorithm of Chekuri-Goel-Khanna-Kumar for minimizing average flow time on parallel machines.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"], "authors": ["Jivitej S.
