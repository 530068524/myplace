{"title": "A Heuristic Quasi-Polynomial Algorithm for Discrete Logarithm in Finite Fields of Small Characteristic.", "fields": ["logarithm", "iterated logarithm", "baby step giant step", "function field sieve", "heuristic"], "abstract": "The difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in fields \\(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}\\) depends on the relative sizes of k and q. Until recently all the cases had a sub-exponential complexity of type L(1/3), similar to the factorization problem. In 2013, Joux designed a new algorithm with a complexity of L(1/4 + e) in small characteristic. In the same spirit, we propose in this article another heuristic algorithm that provides a quasi-polynomial complexity when q is of size at most comparable with k. By quasi-polynomial, we mean a runtime of n O(logn) where n is the bit-size of the input. For larger values of q that stay below the limit \\(L_{q^k}(1/3)\\), our algorithm loses its quasi-polynomial nature, but still surpasses the Function Field Sieve. Complexity results in this article rely on heuristics which have been checked experimentally.", "citation": "Citations (270)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Lorraine", "University of Lorraine", "University of Paris", "University of Lorraine"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Razvan Barbulescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbulescu:Razvan", "Pierrick Gaudry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaudry:Pierrick", "Antoine Joux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joux:Antoine", "Emmanuel Thom\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thom=eacute=:Emmanuel"], "pages": 16}
