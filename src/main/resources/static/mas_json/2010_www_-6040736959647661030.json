{"title": "Diversifying landmark image search results by learning interested views from community photos.", "fields": ["landmark", "ranking", "table of contents", "data mining", "world wide web"], "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate a novel landmark photo search and browsing system: Agate, which ranks landmark image search results considering their relevance, diversity and quality. Agate learns from community photos the most interested aspects and related activities of a landmark, and generates adaptively a Table of Content (TOC) as a summary of the attractions to facilitate the user browsing. Image search results are thus re-ranked with the TOC so as to ensure a quick overview of the attractions of the landmarks. A novel non-parametric TOC generation and set-based ranking algorithm, MoM-DPM Sets, is proposed as the key technology of Agate. Experimental results based on human evaluation show the effectiveness of our model and users' preference for Agate.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yuheng Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Yuheng", "Mo Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Mo", "Xin-Jing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xin=Jing", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lei", "Wei-Ying Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Wei=Ying"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
