{"title": "Optimal Compression of Approximate Inner Products and Dimension Reduction.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "sketch", "euclidean space", "dimensionality reduction", "correlation"], "abstract": "Let X be a set of n points of norm at most 1 in the Euclidean space R^k, and suppose \u22650. An \u2265-distance sketch for X is a data structure that, given any two points of X enables one to recover the square of the (Euclidean) distance between them up to an additive} error of \u2265. Let f(n,k,\u2265) denote the minimum possible number of bits of such a sketch. Here we determine f(n,k,\u2265) up to a constant factor for all n \u2265 k \u2265 1 and all \u2265 \u2265 \\frac{1}{n^{0.49}}. Our proof is algorithmic, and provides an efficient algorithm for computing a sketch of size O(f(n,k,\u2265)/n) for each point, so that the square of the distance between any two points can be computed from their sketches up to an additive error of \u2265 in time linear in the length of the sketches. We also discuss the case of smaller \u22652/\u221a n and obtain some new results about dimension reduction in this range. In particular, we show that for any such \u2265 and any k \u2264 t=\\frac{\\log (2+\u2265^2 n)}{\u2265^2} there are configurations of n points in R^k that cannot be embedded in R^{\u2113} for \u2113", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Noga Alon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alon:Noga", "Bo'az Klartag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klartag:Bo=az"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
