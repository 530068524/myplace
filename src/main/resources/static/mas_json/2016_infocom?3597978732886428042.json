Communication efficiency, and data privacy are two main challenges for distributed stream monitoring services. In this paper, we propose PriStream, the first communication-efficient and privacy-preserving distributed stream monitoring system for thresholded PERCENTILE aggregates. PriStream allows the monitoring service provider to evaluate an arbitrary function over a desired percentile of i distributed data reports and monitor when the output exceeds a predetermined system threshold. Detailed theoretical analysis and evaluations show that PriStream has high accuracy and communication efficiency, and differential privacy guarantees under a strong adversary model.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "University of Hawaii", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Jingchao Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jingchao", "Rui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Rui", "Jinxue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jinxue", "Yanchao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanchao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
