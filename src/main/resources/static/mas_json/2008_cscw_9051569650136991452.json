To explore the value of  sharing suggestions  in sparking communication and facilitating sharing between extended families, we iteratively built SPARCS, a prototype that encourages frequent sharing of photos and calendar information between extended families. Results from a five-week field study with 7 pairs of families highlight a number of important features for an ideal sharing system to help families stay connected, including asynchronous chat and easily configurable sharing suggestions.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["A.
