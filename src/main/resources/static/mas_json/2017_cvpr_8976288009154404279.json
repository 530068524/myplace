The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a convolutional neural network architecture for geometric matching. The architecture is based on three main components that mimic the standard steps of feature extraction, matching and simultaneous inlier detection and model parameter estimation, while being trainable end-to-end. Second, we demonstrate that the network parameters can be trained from synthetically generated imagery without the need for manual annotation and that our matching layer significantly increases generalization capabilities to never seen before images. Finally, we show that the same model can perform both instance-level and category-level matching giving state-of-the-art results on the challenging Proposal Flow dataset.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ignacio Rocco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rocco:Ignacio", "Relja Arandjelovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arandjelovic:Relja", "Josef Sivic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sivic:Josef"], "pages": 10}
