YumiInt consists of two systems: YumiDev and YumiMeta. YumiDev is an off-line integration system that builds the key components (e.g., query translation and entity resolution) of YumiMeta. YumiMeta is the Web application to which users post queries. It translates queries to multiple sources and gets back aggregated lists of results. We present the two systems in this paper.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Eduard Constantin Dragut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dragut:Eduard_Constantin", "Brian P.
