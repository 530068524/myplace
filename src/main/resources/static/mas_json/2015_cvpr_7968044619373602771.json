{"title": "FPA-CS: Focal plane array-based compressive imaging in short-wave infrared.", "fields": ["cardinal point", "architecture", "pixel", "compressed sensing", "reconstruction algorithm"], "abstract": "Cameras for imaging in short and mid-wave infrared spectra are significantly more expensive than their counterparts in visible imaging. As a result, high-resolution imaging in those spectrum remains beyond the reach of most consumers. Over the last decade, compressive sensing (CS) has emerged as a potential means to realize inexpensive shortwave infrared cameras. One approach for doing this is the single-pixel camera (SPC) where a single detector acquires coded measurements of a high-resolution image. A computational reconstruction algorithm is then used to recover the image from these coded measurements. Unfortunately, the measurement rate of a SPC is insufficient to enable imaging at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We present a focal plane array-based compressive sensing (FPA-CS) architecture that achieves high spatial and temporal resolutions. The idea is to use an array of SPCs that sense in parallel to increase the measurement rate, and consequently, the achievable spatio-temporal resolution of the camera. We develop a proof-of-concept prototype in the short-wave infrared using a sensor with 64\u00d7 64 pixels; the prototype provides a 4096\u00d7 increase in the measurement rate compared to the SPC and achieves a megapixel resolution at video rate using CS techniques.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Rice University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Huaijin G.
