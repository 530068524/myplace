Our experimental results showed that the leakage received by a dipole antenna was about 0 dBm (1 mW) at a point 5 cm in front of the door. A rectenna consisting of a dipole antenna and charge pump can convert the leaked microwave energy into a DC current. When a microwave oven is operated for 2 min, 9.98 mJ of energy was harvested. We demonstrated that this energy is sufficient for powering a digital cooking timer to count down for 3 min and beep for 2.5 s. The operation of other kitchen devices was also demonstrated.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yoshihiro Kawahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawahara:Yoshihiro", "Xiaoying Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Xiaoying", "Ryo Shigeta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shigeta:Ryo", "Rushi Vyas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vyas:Rushi", "Manos M.
