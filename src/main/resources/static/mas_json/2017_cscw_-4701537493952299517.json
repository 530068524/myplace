Through extensive field studies with experts and parents, we found that parents are more likely to experience communication conflict with preschool children (3-6 years old) on school mornings. In consultation with domain professionals and families, we designed WAKEY, a technology-based approach that helps parents use better communication strategies to teach preschool children to carry out their morning routines. Following the intervention with WAKEY, parents reported significantly reduced levels of frustration during morning routines and greater independent behavior by children. Furthermore, parents reported experiencing changes in their parenting attitudes and finding new insights into communication.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Meng-Ying Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Meng=Ying", "Yi-Hsuan Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Yi=Hsuan", "Long-Fei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Long=Fei", "Ting-Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Ting=Wei", "Wei-Che Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Wei=Che", "Chia-Yu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Chia=Yu", "Rui Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Rui", "Ko-Yu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Ko=Yu", "Min-Hua Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Min=Hua", "Jane Yung-jen Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Jane_Yung=jen"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
