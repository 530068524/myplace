{"title": "A Correlation Clustering Framework for Community Detection.", "fields": ["correlation clustering", "cluster", "clustering coefficient", "modularity", "approximation algorithm"], "abstract": "Graph clustering, or community detection, is the task of identifying groups of closely related objects in a large network. In this paper we introduce a new community detection framework called LambdaCC that is based on a specially weighted version of correlation clustering. A key component in our methodology is a clustering resolution parameter, ?, which implicitly controls the size and structure of clusters formed by our framework. We show that, by increasing this parameter, our objective effectively interpolates between two different strategies in graph clustering:  finding a sparse cut and forming dense subgraphs. Our methodology unifies and generalizes a number of other important clustering quality functions including modularity, sparsest cut, and cluster deletion, and places them all within the context of an optimization problem that has been well studied from the perspective of approximation algorithms. Our approach to clustering is particularly relevant in the regime of  finding dense clusters, as it leads to the first constant-factor approximation for the cluster deletion problem. We use our approach to cluster several real world graphs, including a number of large collaboration networks from online databases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Nate Veldt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veldt:Nate", "David F.
