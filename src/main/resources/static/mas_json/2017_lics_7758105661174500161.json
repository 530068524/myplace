We first design shift-invariant maximal filters in order to define this new model of computation. Starting from different assumptions, we show how to construct such filters, and analyze the computation power of the induced cellular automata computation model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Montpellier"], "authors": ["Julien Cervelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cervelle:Julien", "Gr\u00e9gory Lafitte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lafitte:Gr=eacute=gory"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
