Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) have been widely used to defend against jamming attacks. However, both will fail if the jammer jams all frequency channels or has high transmit power. In this paper, we propose BitTrickle, an anti-jamming wireless communication scheme that allows communication in the presence of a broadband and high power reactive jammer by exploiting the reaction time of the jammer. We develop a prototype of BitTrickle using the USRP platform running GNURadio. Our evaluation shows that when under powerful reactive jamming, BitTrickle still maintains communication, whereas other schemes such as 802.11 DSSS fail completely.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Yao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0007:Yao", "Peng Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Peng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
