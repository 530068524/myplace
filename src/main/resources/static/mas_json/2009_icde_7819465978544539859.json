{"title": "An Architecture for Regulatory Compliant Database Management.", "fields": ["relational database", "semi structured data", "server", "retention period", "transaction processing"], "abstract": "Spurred by financial scandals and privacy concerns, governments worldwide have moved to ensure confidence in digital records by regulating their retention and deletion. These requirements have led to a huge market for compliance storage servers, which ensure that data are not shredded or altered before the end of their mandatory retention period. These servers preserve unstructured and semi-structured data at a file-level granularity: email, spreadsheets, reports, instant messages. In this paper, we extend this level of protection to structured data residing in relational databases. We propose a compliant DBMS architecture and two refinements that illustrate the additional security that one can gain with only a slight performance penalty, with almost no modifications to the DBMS kernel. We evaluate our proposed architecture through experiments with TPC-C on a high-performance DBMS, and show that the runtime overhead for transaction processing is approximately 10\\% in typical configurations.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Arizona", "Indian Institutes of Technology", "Indian Institutes of Technology"], "authors": ["Soumyadeb Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Soumyadeb", "Marianne Winslett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winslett:Marianne", "Richard T.
