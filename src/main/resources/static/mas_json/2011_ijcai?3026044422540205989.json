{"title": "On the Effectiveness of CNF and DNF Representations in Contingent Planning.", "fields": ["machine learning", "heuristic function", "planner", "nondeterministic algorithm", "search algorithm"], "abstract": "This paper investigates the effectiveness of two state representations, CNF and DNF, in contingent planning. To this end, we developed a new contingent planner, called CNFct, using the AND/OR forward search algorithm PrAO [To et al., 2011] and an extension of the CNF representation of [To et al., 2010] for conformant planning to handle nondeterministic and sensing actions for contingent planning. The study uses CNFct and DNFct [To et al., 2011] and proposes a new heuristic function for both planners. The experiments demonstrate that both CNFct and DNFct offer very competitive performance in a large range of benchmarks but neither of the two representations is a clear winner over the other. The paper identifies properties of the representation schemes that can affect their performance on different problems.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["New Mexico State University", "New Mexico State University", "New Mexico State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Son Thanh To.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/To:Son_Thanh", "Enrico Pontelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pontelli:Enrico", "Tran Cao Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Tran_Cao"], "pages": 6}
