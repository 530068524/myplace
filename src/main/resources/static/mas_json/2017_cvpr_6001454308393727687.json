{"title": "Single Image Reflection Suppression.", "fields": ["fidelity", "artificial intelligence", "linear programming", "laplace operator", "computer vision"], "abstract": "Reflections are a common artifact in images taken through glass windows. Automatically removing the reflection artifacts after the picture is taken is an ill-posed problem. Attempts to solve this problem using optimization schemes therefore rely on various prior assumptions from the physical world. Instead of removing reflections from a single image, which has met with limited success so far, we propose a novel approach to suppress reflections. It is based on a Laplacian data fidelity term and an l-zero gradient sparsity term imposed on the output. With experiments on artificial and real-world images we show that our reflection suppression method performs better than the state-of-the-art reflection removal techniques.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Nikolaos Arvanitopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arvanitopoulos:Nikolaos", "Radhakrishna Achanta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achanta:Radhakrishna", "Sabine S\u00fcsstrunk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=uuml=sstrunk:Sabine"], "pages": 9}
