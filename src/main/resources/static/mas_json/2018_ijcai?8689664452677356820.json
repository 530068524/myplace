We investigate the question of avoiding re-planning in subsequent decision steps by directly using the sub-tree as an action recommender. Firstly, we propose a method for open loop control via a new algorithm taking the decision of re-planning or not at each time step based on an analysis of the statistics of the sub-tree. Secondly , we show that the probability of selecting a subopti-mal action at any depth of the tree can be upper bounded and converges towards zero. Moreover, this upper bound decays in a logarithmic way between subsequent depths. This leads to a distinction between node-wise optimality and state-wise optimality. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our method achieves a compromise between loss of performance and computational gain.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "ONERA - The Fre ... oulouse, France", "ONERA - The Fre ... oulouse, France"], "authors": ["Erwan Lecarpentier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lecarpentier:Erwan", "Guillaume Infantes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Infantes:Guillaume", "Charles Lesire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lesire:Charles", "Emmanuel Rachelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rachelson:Emmanuel"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
