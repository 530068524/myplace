For that MBPTA requires the analysed tasks' maximum observed execution times to adhere to an extreme value distribution, such as Gumbel or Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), and allows determining execution time values expected to be exceeded only with arbitrarily small probabilities. Several works on the area assume that the Gumbel model should be employed in such analysis, while others consider GEV, which generalizes Weibull, Gumbel and Frechet models, would be more adequate. In this work we perform an empirical assessment on the reliability and tightness of the WCET bounds determined through the GEV and Gumbel models. We do so by comparing the yielded estimates and their associated confidence intervals against the maximum values observed on large samples (e.g. of size 100 million), of both real and synthetic nature, as the modelling sample size is increased.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina", "Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina", "Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Karila Palma Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva:Karila_Palma", "Luis Fernando Arcaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arcaro:Luis_Fernando", "R\u00f4mulo Silva de Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:R=ocirc=mulo_Silva_de"], "pages": 11}
