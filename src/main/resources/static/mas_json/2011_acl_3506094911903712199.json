{"title": "Learning Dependency-Based Compositional Semantics.", "fields": ["parsing", "principle of compositionality", "question answering", "logical form", "annotation"], "abstract": "Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms. In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs. In tackling this challenging learning problem, we introduce a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms. On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks (Geo and Jobs), our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms.", "citation": "Citations (434)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy", "Michael I.
