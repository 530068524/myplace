On the other hand, in practice, modern day neural networks are trained efficiently using SGD and a variety of tricks that include different activation functions (e.g. ReLU), over-specification (i.e., train networks which are larger than needed), and regularization. In this paper we revisit the computational complexity of training neural networks from a modern perspective. We provide both positive and negative results, some of them yield new provably efficient and practical algorithms for training certain types of neural networks.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Roi Livni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Livni:Roi", "Shai Shalev-Shwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalev=Shwartz:Shai", "Ohad Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamir:Ohad"], "pages": 9}
