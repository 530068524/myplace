{"title": "On the Consistency of Ranking Algorithms.", "fields": ["learning to rank", "machine learning", "ranking svm", "collaborative filtering", "ranking"], "abstract": "We present a theoretical analysis of supervised ranking, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the asymptotic consistency of algorithms based on minimizing a surrogate loss function. We show that many commonly used surrogate losses are inconsistent; surprisingly, we show inconsistency even in low-noise settings. We present a new value-regularized linear loss, establish its consistency under reasonable assumptions on noise, and show that it outperforms conventional ranking losses in a collaborative filtering experiment.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["John C.
