We present findings from an evaluation of the benefits of this practice where users achieved significantly better results in memory recall and performance when given access to such a guidance method. The study was conducted on both standard desktop computers with mouse and keyboard, as well as on an immersive CAVE system. Interestingly, our results also show that the improvements were more dramatic for desktop users than for CAVE users, even outperforming the latter. Furthermore, the study indicates that allowing the users to retain local control over the navigation on the desktop platform helps them in familiarizing themselves with the 3D world.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Arkansas", "Chalmers University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Niklas Elmqvist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elmqvist:Niklas", "Mihail Eduard Tudoreanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tudoreanu:Mihail_Eduard", "Philippas Tsigas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsigas:Philippas"], "pages": 10}
