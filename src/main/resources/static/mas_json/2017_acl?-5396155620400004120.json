Our method interactively obtains user feedback to gradually improve the results of a state-of-the-art integer linear programming (ILP) framework for MDS. Our methods complement fully automatic methods in producing high-quality summaries with a minimum number of iterations and feedbacks. We conduct multiple simulation-based experiments and analyze the effect of feedback-based concept selection in the ILP setup in order to maximize the user-desired content in the summary.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["P.
