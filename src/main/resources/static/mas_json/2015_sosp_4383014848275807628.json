Verification can, in principle, eliminate these bugs a priori, but verification has historically been difficult to apply at full-program scale, much less distributed-system scale.   We describe a methodology for building practical and provably correct distributed systems based on a unique blend of TLA-style state-machine refinement and Hoare-logic verification. We demonstrate the methodology on a complex implementation of a Paxos-based replicated state machine library and a lease-based sharded key-value store. We prove that each obeys a concise safety specification, as well as desirable liveness requirements. Each implementation achieves performance competitive with a reference system. With our methodology and lessons learned, we aim to raise the standard for distributed systems from \"tested\" to \"correct.\"", "citation": "Citations (121)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Chris Hawblitzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hawblitzel:Chris", "Jon Howell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Howell:Jon", "Manos Kapritsos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapritsos:Manos", "Jacob R.
