{"title": "Negation Focus Identification with Contextual Discourse Information.", "fields": ["graph", "natural language", "expression", "negation", "information extraction"], "abstract": "Negative expressions are common in natural language text and play a critical role in information extraction. However, the performances of current systems are far from satisfaction, largely due to its focus on intrasentence information and its failure to consider inter-sentence information. In this paper, we propose a graph model to enrich intrasentence features with inter-sentence features from both lexical and topic perspectives. Evaluation on the *SEM 2012 shared task corpus indicates the usefulness of contextual discourse information in negation focus identification and justifies the effectiveness of our graph model in capturing such global information.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Soochow University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Bowei Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou:Bowei", "Guodong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guodong", "Qiaoming Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Qiaoming"], "pages": 9}
