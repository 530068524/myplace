We prove two complementary results that confirm this intuition. Firstly, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using fewer copies of the state, i.e. the sample complexity of tomography decreases with the rank. Secondly, we show that unknown low- rank states can be reconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from compressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli measurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions about the unknown state. In this paper, we present a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the restricted isometry property for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we obtain near-optimal error bounds for the realistic situation where the data contain noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank with decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper bounds on the sample complexity of compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample complexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements. Using numerical simulations, we 5 Author to whom any correspondence should be addressed.", "citation": "Citations (198)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Freiburg", "National Institute of Standards and Technology", "Free University of Berlin", "Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics", "Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics", "University of Sydney", "Max Planck Society", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Institut f\u00fcr Th ...
