Recently the idea of progressively  querying  user responses through an  initial interview  process has been proposed as a useful new user preference elicitation strategy. In this paper, we present  functional matrix factorization  (fMF), a novel cold-start recommendation method that solves the problem of initial interview construction within the context of learning user and item profiles. Specifically, fMF constructs a decision tree for the initial interview with each node being an interview question, enabling the recommender to query a user adaptively according to her prior responses. More importantly, we associate latent profiles for each node of the tree --- in effect restricting the latent profiles to be a function of possible answers to the interview questions --- which allows the profiles to be gradually refined through the interview process based on user responses. We develop an iterative optimization algorithm that alternates between decision tree construction and latent profiles extraction as well as a regularization scheme that takes into account of the tree structure. Experimental results on three benchmark recommendation data sets demonstrate that the proposed fMF algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods for cold-start recommendation.", "citation": "Citations (212)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ke Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0002:Ke", "Shuang-Hong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shuang=Hong", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
