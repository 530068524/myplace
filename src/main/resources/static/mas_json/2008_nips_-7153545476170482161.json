For d covariates, there are 2d basis coefficients to estimate, which renders conventional approaches computationally prohibitive when d is large. However, for a wide class of densities that satisfy a certain sparsity condition, our estimator runs in probabilistic polynomial time and adapts to the unknown sparsity of the underlying density in two key ways: (1) it attains near-minimax mean-squared error, and (2) the computational complexity is lower for sparser densities. Our method also allows for flexible control of the trade-off between mean-squared error and computational complexity.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Duke University", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Maxim Raginsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raginsky:Maxim", "Svetlana Lazebnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazebnik:Svetlana", "Rebecca Willett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willett:Rebecca", "Jorge G.
