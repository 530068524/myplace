{"title": "Exploiting Strong Convexity from Data with Primal-Dual First-Order Algorithms.", "fields": ["convex function", "empirical risk minimization", "saddle point", "convexity", "proximal gradient methods for learning"], "abstract": "We consider empirical risk minimization of linear predictors with convex loss functions. Such problems can be reformulated as convex-concave saddle point problems, and thus are well suitable for primal-dual first-order algorithms. However, primal-dual algorithms often require explicit strongly convex regularization in order to obtain fast linear convergence, and the required dual proximal mapping may not admit closed-form or efficient solution. In this paper, we develop both batch and randomized primal-dual algorithms that can exploit strong convexity from data adaptively and are capable of achieving linear convergence even without regularization. We also present dual-free variants of the adaptive primal-dual algorithms that do not require computing the dual proximal mapping, which are especially suitable for logistic regression.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jialei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jialei", "Lin Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Lin"], "pages": 9}
