{"title": "KiWi: A Key-Value Map for Scalable Real-Time Analytics.", "fields": ["analytics", "skip list", "range query", "big data", "memory management"], "abstract": "Modern big data processing platforms employ huge in-memory key-value (KV) maps. Their applications simultaneously drive high-rate data ingestion and large-scale analytics. These two scenarios expect KV-map implementations that scale well with both real-time updates and large atomic scans triggered by range queries.   We present KiWi, the first atomic KV-map to efficiently support simultaneous large scans and real-time access. The key to achieving this is treating scans as first class citizens,and organizing the data structure around them. KiWi provides wait-free scans, whereas its put operations are lightweight and lock-free. It optimizes memory management jointly with data structure access.We implement KiWi and compare it to state-of-the-art solutions. Compared to other KV-maps providing atomic scans, KiWi performs either long scans or concurrent puts an order of magnitude faster. Its scans are twice as fast as non-atomic ones implemented via iterators in the Java skiplist.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "VMware", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Dmitry Basin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basin:Dmitry", "Edward Bortnikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bortnikov:Edward", "Anastasia Braginsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braginsky:Anastasia", "Guy Golan-Gueta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golan=Gueta:Guy", "Eshcar Hillel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hillel:Eshcar", "Idit Keidar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keidar:Idit", "Moshe Sulamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sulamy:Moshe"], "pages": 13}
