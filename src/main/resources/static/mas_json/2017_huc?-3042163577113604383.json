Assistive systems provide dynamic support, adapt to the user needs, and alleviate perceived workload from expert workers supporting freshman workers. New assembly instructions can be implemented at a fast pace. These assistive systems decrease the cognitive workload of workers as they need to memorize new assembly instructions with each change of product lines. However, the design of assistive systems for the industry is a challenging task. Once deployed, people have to work with such systems for full workdays. From experiences made during our past project motionEAP, we report on design challenges for interactive worker assistance at manual assembly workplaces as well as challenges encountered when deploying interactive assistive systems for diverse user populations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "authors": ["Thomas Kosch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosch:Thomas", "Yomna Abdelrahman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdelrahman:Yomna", "Markus Funk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Funk:Markus", "Albrecht Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt_0001:Albrecht"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
