In this paper, we propose GCN, a multiview geolocation model based on Graph Convolutional Networks, that uses both text and network context. We compare GCN to the state-of-the-art, and to two baselines we propose, and show that our model achieves or is competitive with the state- of-the-art over three benchmark geolocation datasets when sufficient supervision is available. We also evaluate GCN under a minimal supervision scenario, and show it outperforms baselines. We find that highway network gates are essential for controlling the amount of useful neighbourhood expansion in GCN.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Timothy Baldwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldwin:Timothy", "Trevor Cohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohn:Trevor", "Afshin Rahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahimi:Afshin"], "pages": 11}
