In this study we first expose the mathematical nature of this problem --- multi-objective binary integer linear programming. Then, we implement/propose three mathematical programming approaches to solve this problem at different scales. For small-scale problems (roughly less than 100 features), we implement two established approaches to find all exact solutions. For medium-to-large problems (roughly, more than 100 features), we propose one efficient approach that can generate a representation of the entire Pareto front in linear time complexity. The empirical results show that our proposed method can find significantly more non-dominated solutions in similar or less execution time, in comparison with IBEA and its recent enhancement (i.e., IBED that combines IBEA and Differential Evolution).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yinxing Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Yinxing", "Yan-Fu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yan=Fu"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 12}
