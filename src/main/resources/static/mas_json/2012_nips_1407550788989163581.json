The transelliptical family is an extension of the nonparanormal family proposed by Liu et al. (2009). Just as the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables using univariate functions, the transelliptical extends the elliptical family in the same way. We propose a nonparametric rank-based regularization estimator which achieves the parametric rates of convergence for both graph recovery and parameter estimation. Such a result suggests that the extra robustness and flexibility obtained by the semiparametric transelliptical modeling incurs almost no efficiency loss. We also discuss the relationship between this work with the transelliptical component analysis proposed by Han and Liu (2012).", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Han", "Fang Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Fang", "Cun-Hui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Cun=Hui"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
