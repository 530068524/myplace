Mobile users are billed based on the traffic volume when accessing data service. In this work, we assess both this metered accounting architecture and application-specific charging policies by operators from the security perspective. We have identified loopholes in both, and discovered two effective attacks exploiting the loopholes. The \"toll-free-data-access-attack\" enables the attacker to access any data service for free. The \"stealth-spam-attack\" incurs any large traffic volume to the victim, while the victim may not be even aware of such spam traffic.Our experiments on two operational 3G networks have confirmed the feasibility and simplicity of such attacks. We also propose defense remedies.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Chunyi Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Chunyi", "Chi-Yu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chi=Yu", "Guan-Hua Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Guan=Hua", "Songwu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Songwu", "Lixia Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lixia"], "conf": "ccs", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
