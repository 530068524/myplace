Our recurrent neural network based model captures both word sequence and dependency tree substructure information by stacking bidirectional treestructured LSTM-RNNs on bidirectional sequential LSTM-RNNs. This allows our model to jointly represent both entities and relations with shared parameters in a single model. We further encourage detection of entities during training and use of entity information in relation extraction via entity pretraining and scheduled sampling. Our model improves over the stateof-the-art feature-based model on end-toend relation extraction, achieving 12.1% and 5.7% relative error reductions in F1score on ACE2005 and ACE2004, respectively. We also show that our LSTMRNN based model compares favorably to the state-of-the-art CNN based model (in F1-score) on nominal relation classification (SemEval-2010 Task 8). Finally, we present an extensive ablation analysis of several model components.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Makoto Miwa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miwa:Makoto", "Mohit Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Mohit"], "pages": -1}
