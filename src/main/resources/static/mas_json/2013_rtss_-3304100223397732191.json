However, existing mechanisms for event-triggered wake-up, such as using auxiliary low-power sensors or via wireless radio communication, cannot be applied to some domain-specific applications such as structural health monitoring (SHM) and volcano monitoring(VM). These applications have different requirements about the wake-up from 'conventional' WSN applications. Firstly, the wake-up should be network-wide and nodes to be woken up are not limited to those close to event location. In addition, the wake-up should be reliable to avoid unnecessary false wake-ups. Finally, the wake-up should be fast to capture the short events in these applications. How to realize network-wide, reliable and fast wake-up in a WSN is a challenging task that has not been addressed in literature. In this paper, based on the developed two types of wake-up units, we designed a novel chain-reaction wake-up mechanism to fulfill the task. As the key in this mechanism, we identify the sentry node placement problem in which some nodes used to initialize the wake-up process are carefully selected such that the wake-up delay is minimized under the false alarm constraint. We propose two greedy algorithms and a randomized one which leverages the solution to the classic Knapsack problem. The performance of the proposed wake-up mechanism is demonstrated through both simulation and experiments.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Temple University", "Dept. of Comp., ... ong Kong, China", "Dept. of Comp., ... ong Kong, China"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Xuefeng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xuefeng", "Jiannong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Jiannong", "Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie"], "pages": 10}
