In g-leakage, the benefit that an adversary derives from a certain guess about a secret is specified using a gain function g. Gain functions allow a wide variety of operational scenarios to be modeled, including those where the adversary benefits from guessing a value close to the secret, guessing a part of the secret, guessing a property of the secret, or guessing the secret within some number of tries. We prove important properties of g-leakage, including bounds between min-capacity, g-capacity, and Shannon capacity. We also show a deep connection between a strong leakage ordering on two channels, C 1  and C 2 , and the possibility of factoring C 1  into C 2 C 3 , for some C 3 . Based on this connection, we propose a generalization of the Lattice of Information from deterministic to probabilistic channels.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "University of Miami", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "IMDEA", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Florida International University", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "Surveillance &  ... e Lab., NY, USA"], "authors": ["M\u00e1rio S.
