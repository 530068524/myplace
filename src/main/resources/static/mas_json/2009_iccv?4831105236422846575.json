The main contribution is a probabilistic detection framework defined on spatio-temporal lattices, which enables joint analysis of image frames. For this purpose, we introduce two complementary cost functions for creating the spatio-temporal lattice and for performing global inference of the occlusion boundaries, respectively. In addition, a novel combination of low-level occlusion features is discriminatively learnt in the detection framework. Simulations on the CMU Motion Dataset provide ample evidence that proposed algorithm outperforms the leading existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Mehmet Emre Sargin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sargin:Mehmet_Emre", "Luca Bertelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertelli:Luca", "Bangalore S.
