{"title": "A Dynamic Logic of Normative Systems.", "fields": ["non classical logic", "resolution", "autoepistemic logic", "zeroth order logic", "propositional variable"], "abstract": "We propose a logical framework to represent and reason about agent interactions in normative systems. Our starting point is a dynamic logic of propositional assignments whose satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete. We show that it embeds Coalition Logic of Propositional Control CL-PC and that various notions of ability and capability can be captured in it. We illustrate it on a water resource management case study. Finally, we show how the logic can be easily extended in order to represent constitutive rules which are also an essential component of the modelling of social reality.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Essex", "IRIT, France"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Andreas Herzig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herzig:Andreas", "Emiliano Lorini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lorini:Emiliano", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Moisan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moisan:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Nicolas Troquard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Troquard:Nicolas"], "pages": 6}
