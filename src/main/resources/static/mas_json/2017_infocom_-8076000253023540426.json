{"title": "The efficiency of open access in platforms for networked cournot markets.", "fields": ["cournot competition", "market research", "social welfare", "incentive", "inefficiency"], "abstract": "This paper studies how the efficiency of an online platform is impacted by the degree to which access of platform participants is open or controlled. The study is motivated by an emerging trend within platforms to impose increasingly finegrained control over the options available to platform participants. While early online platforms allowed open access, e.g., Ebay allows any seller to interact with any buyer; modern platforms often impose matches directly, e.g., Uber directly matches drivers to riders. This control is performed with the goal of achieving more efficient market outcomes. However, the results in this paper highlight that imposing matches may create new strategic incentives that lead to increased inefficiency. In particular, in the context of networked Cournot competition, we prove that open access platforms guarantee social welfare within 7/16 of the optimal; whereas controlled allocation platforms can have social welfare unboundedly worse than optimal.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "University of British Columbia", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["John Z.
