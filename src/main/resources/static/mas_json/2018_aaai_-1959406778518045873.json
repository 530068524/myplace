{"title": "A Parallelizable Acceleration Framework for Packing Linear Programs.", "fields": ["black box", "solver", "parallelizable manifold", "speedup", "order of magnitude"], "abstract": "This paper presents an acceleration framework for packing linear programming problems where the amount of data available is limited, i.e., where the number of constraints m is small compared to the variable dimension n. The framework can be used as a black box to speed up linear programming solvers dramatically, by two orders of magnitude in our experiments. We present worst-case guarantees on the quality of the solution and the speedup provided by the algorithm, showing that the framework provides an approximately optimal solution while running the original solver on a much smaller problem. The framework can be used to accelerate exact solvers, approximate solvers, and parallel/distributed solvers. Further, it can be used for both linear programs and integer linear programs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Palma London.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/London:Palma", "Shai Vardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vardi:Shai", "Adam Wierman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wierman:Adam", "Hanling Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Hanling"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
