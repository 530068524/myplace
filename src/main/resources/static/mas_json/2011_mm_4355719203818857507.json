The Creation-Tool was conceived and designed to assist the creative processes of choreographers, working as a digital notebook for personal annotations. The prototype, developed for Tablet PCs, is a real-time multimodal video annotator based on keyboard, pen and voice inputs. In addition, a remote control for mobile devices was added to the system. Two types of annotations were defined: annotation marks and regular annotations. The annotations marks are defined by a keyword and an icon, in contrast to regular annotations that do not have a pre-defined structure. Motion tracking defines the dynamic behavior of the annotations and voice input complements the other modalities.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Universidade Nova de Lisboa", "Universidade Nova de Lisboa", "Universidade Nova de Lisboa", "Universidade Nova de Lisboa", "Universidade Nova de Lisboa"], "authors": ["Diogo Cabral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cabral:Diogo", "Jo\u00e3o Valente.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valente:Jo=atilde=o", "Jo\u00e3o M.
