{"title": "Max-Margin Nonparametric Latent Feature Models for Link Prediction.", "fields": ["relational model", "probabilistic latent semantic analysis", "latent class model", "discriminative model", "likelihood function"], "abstract": "We present a max-margin nonparametric latent feature relational model, which unites the ideas of max-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics to discover discriminative latent features for link prediction and automatically infer the unknown latent social dimension. By minimizing a hinge-loss using the linear expectation operator, we can perform posterior inference efficiently without dealing with a highly nonlinear link likelihood function; by using a fully-Bayesian formulation, we can avoid tuning regularization constants. Experimental results on real datasets appear to demonstrate the benefits inherited from max-margin learning and fully-Bayesian nonparametric inference.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
