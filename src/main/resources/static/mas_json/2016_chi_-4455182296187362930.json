{"title": "Cilllia: 3D Printed Micro-Pillar Structures for Surface Texture, Actuation and Sensing.", "fields": ["actuator", "pillar", "swipe", "3d printing", "surface finish"], "abstract": "This work presents a method for 3D printing hair-like structures on both flat and curved surfaces. It allows a user to design and fabricate hair geometries that are smaller than 100 micron. We built a software platform to let users quickly define the hair angle, thickness, density, and height. The ability to fabricate customized hair-like structures not only expands the library of 3D-printable shapes, but also enables us to design passive actuators and swipe sensors. We also present several applications that show how the 3D-printed hair can be used for designing everyday interactive objects.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Addimation, Inc ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jifei Ou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ou:Jifei", "Gershon Dublon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dublon:Gershon", "Chin-Yi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Chin=Yi", "Felix Heibeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heibeck:Felix", "Karl Willis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willis:Karl", "Hiroshi Ishii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishii_0001:Hiroshi"], "pages": 12}
