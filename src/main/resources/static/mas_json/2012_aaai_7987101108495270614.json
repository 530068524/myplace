{"title": "Transportability of Causal Effects: Completeness Results.", "fields": ["observational study", "data mining", "completeness", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The study of transportability aims to identify conditions under which causal information learned from experiments can be reused in a different environment where only passive observations can be collected. The theory introduced in [Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011] (henceforth [PB, 2011]) defines formal conditions for such transfer but falls short of providing an effective procedure for deciding, given assumptions about differences between the source and target domains, whether transportability is feasible. This paper provides such procedure. It establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when causal effects in the target domain are estimable from both the statistical information available and the causal information transferred from the experiments. The paper further provides a complete algorithm for computing the transport formula, that is, a way of fusing experimental and observational information to synthesize an estimate of the desired causal relation.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Elias Bareinboim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bareinboim:Elias", "Judea Pearl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pearl:Judea"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
