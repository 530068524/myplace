{"title": "A Stochastic Decoder for Neural Machine Translation.", "fields": ["deterministic system", "generative grammar", "machine translation", "generative model", "sentence"], "abstract": "The process of translation is ambiguous, in that there are typically many valid trans- lations for a given sentence. This gives rise to significant variation in parallel cor- pora, however, most current models of machine translation do not account for this variation, instead treating the prob- lem as a deterministic process. To this end, we present a deep generative model of machine translation which incorporates a chain of latent variables, in order to ac- count for local lexical and syntactic varia- tion in parallel corpora. We provide an in- depth analysis of the pitfalls encountered in variational inference for training deep generative models. Experiments on sev- eral different language pairs demonstrate that the model consistently improves over strong baselines.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Trevor Cohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohn:Trevor", "Philip Schulz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schulz:Philip", "Wilker Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz:Wilker"], "pages": 10}
