Supervised hashing, which incorporates similarity/ dissimilarity information on entity pairs to improve the quality of hashing function learning, has recently received increasing attention. However, in the existing supervised hashing methods for images, an input image is usually encoded by a vector of handcrafted visual features. Such hand-crafted feature vectors do not necessarily preserve the accurate semantic similarities of images pairs, which may often degrade the performance of hashing function learning. In this paper, we propose a supervised hashing method for image retrieval, in which we automatically learn a good image representation tailored to hashing as well as a set of hash functions. The proposed method has two stages. In the first stage, given the pairwise similarity matrix S over training images, we propose a scalable coordinate descent method to decompose S into a product of HHT where H is a matrix with each of its rows being the approximate hash code associated to a training image. In the second stage, we propose to simultaneously learn a good feature representation for the input images as well as a set of hash functions, via a deep convolutional network tailored to the learned hash codes in H and optionally the discrete class labels of the images. Extensive empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets with different kinds of images show that the proposed method has superior performance gains over several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised hashing methods.", "citation": "Citations (312)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Rongkai Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Rongkai", "Yan Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Yan", "Hanjiang Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Hanjiang", "Cong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Cong", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
