Termed a deep reinforcement relevance network (DRRN), the architecture represents action and state spaces with separate embedding vectors, which are combined with an interaction function to approximate the Q-function in reinforcement learning. We evaluate the DRRN on two popular text games, showing superior performance over other deep Qlearning architectures. Experiments with paraphrased action descriptions show that the model is extracting meaning rather than simply memorizing strings of text.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ji He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Ji", "Jianshu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jianshu", "Xiaodong He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Xiaodong", "Jianfeng Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jianfeng", "Lihong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Lihong", "Li Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng_0001:Li", "Mari Ostendorf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostendorf:Mari"], "pages": -1}
