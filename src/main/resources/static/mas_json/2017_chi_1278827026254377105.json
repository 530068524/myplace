{"title": "Scratch Community Blocks: Supporting Children as Data Scientists.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "scratch", "multimedia", "computer programming", "online community"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present  Scratch Community Blocks , a new system that enables children to programmatically access, analyze, and visualize data about their participation in Scratch, an online community for learning computer programming. At its core, our approach involves a shift in who analyzes data: from adult data scientists to young learners themselves. We first introduce the goals and design of the system and then demonstrate it by describing example projects that illustrate its functionality. Next, we show through a series of case studies how the system engages children in not only representing data and answering questions with data but also in self-reflection about their own learning and participation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sayamindu Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Sayamindu", "Benjamin Mako Hill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hill:Benjamin_Mako"], "pages": 12}
