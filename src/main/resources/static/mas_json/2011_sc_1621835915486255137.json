We present the computational advances that have enabled the first multiscale simulation on 190,740 processors by coupling a high-order (spectral element) Navier-Stokes solver with a stochastic (coarse-grained) Molecular Dynamics solver based on Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). The key contributions are proper interface conditions for overlapped domains, topology-aware communication, SIMDization, multiscale visualization and a new domain partitioning for atomistic solvers. We study blood flow in a patient-specific cerebrovasculature with a brain aneurysm, and analyze the interaction of blood cells with the arterial walls endowed with a glycocalyx causing thrombus formation and eventual aneurysm rupture. The macro-scale dynamics (about 3 billion unknowns) are resolved by   Ne\u03baT\u03b1r   - a spectral element solver; the micro-scale flow and cell dynamics within the aneurysm are resolved by an in-house version of DPD-LAMMPS (for an equivalent of about 100 billions molecules).", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Brown University"], "authors": ["Leopold Grinberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grinberg:Leopold", "Joseph A.
