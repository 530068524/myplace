{"title": "Serialization sets: a dynamic dependence-based parallel execution model.", "fields": ["serialization", "execution model", "runtime system", "marshalling", "instruction set"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a new parallel execution model where programmers augment a sequential program with pieces of code called  serializers  that dynamically map computational operations into  serialization sets  of dependent operations. A runtime system executes operations in the same serialization set in program order, and may concurrently execute operations in different sets. Because serialization sets establish a logical ordering on all operations, the resulting parallel execution is predictable and deterministic.   We describe the API and design of Prometheus, a C++ library that implements the serialization set abstraction through compile-time template instantiation and a runtime support library. We evaluate a set of parallel programs running on the x86_64 and SPARC-V9 instruction sets and study their performance on multicore, symmetric multiprocessor, and ccNUMA parallel machines. By contrast with conventional parallel execution models, we find that Prometheus programs are significantly easier to write, test, and debug, and their parallel execution achieves comparable performance.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Matthew D.
