{"title": "On Global Modeling of Backbone Network Traffic.", "fields": ["network traffic simulation", "backbone network", "traffic equations", "limit set", "traffic generation model"], "abstract": "We develop a probabilistic framework for global modeling of the traffic over a computer network. The model integrates existing single-link (-flow) traffic models with the routing over the network to capture the global traffic behavior. It arises from a limit approximation of the traffic fluctuations as the time--scale and the number of users sharing the network grow. The resulting probability model is comprised of a Gaussian and/or a stable, infinite variance components. They can be succinctly described and handled by certain 'space-time' random fields. The model is validated against real data and applied to predict traffic fluctuations over unobserved links from a limited set of observed links.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Stilian Stoev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoev:Stilian", "George Michailidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michailidis:George", "Joel Vaughan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaughan:Joel"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
