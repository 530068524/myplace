The performance of data collection can be measured by its achievable network capacity. Most existing works focus on the capacity of unicast, multicast or snapshot data collection in single-radio single-channel wireless networks, and no dedicated works consider the continuous data collection capacity for WSNs in detail under the protocol interference model. In this paper, we first propose a multi-path scheduling algorithm for the snapshot data collection in single-radio multi-channel WSNs and prove that its achievable network capacity is at least equation, which is a tighter lower bound compared with the previously best result in [5] which is W over 8\u03c1 2 , where W is the bandwidth over a channel, H is the number of the available orthogonal channels, \u03c1 is the ratio of the interference radius over the transmission radius of a sensor and o(\u03c1) is a linear equation of \u03c1. For the continuous data collection problem, although the authors in [5] claim that data collection can be pipelined with existing works, we find that such an idea cannot actually improve network capacity. We explain the reason for this and propose a novel continuous data collection method for dual-radio multi-channel WSNs. This method significantly speeds up the data collection process, and achieves a capacity of equation when \u0394 e  \u2264 12, or equation when \u0394 e  > 12, where n is the number of sensors, M is a constant value and usually M \u226a n, and \u0394 e  is the maximum number of leaf nodes having a same parent node in the routing tree (i.e. data collection tree). The simulation results also indicate that the proposed algorithms significantly improve network capacity compared with the existing works.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["Georgia State University", "Georgia State University", "City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Shouling Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Shouling", "Yingshu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingshu", "Xiaohua Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Xiaohua"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
