{"title": "How did you specify your test suite.", "fields": ["regular expression", "test case", "test suite", "code coverage", "debugging"], "abstract": "Although testing is central to debugging and software certification, there is no adequate language to specify test suites over source code. Such a language should be simple and concise in daily use, feature a precise semantics, and of course, it has to facilitate suitable engines to compute test suites and assess the coverage achieved by a test suite.   This paper introduces the language FQL designed to fit these purposes. We achieve the necessary expressive power by a natural extension of regular expressions which matches test suites rather than individual executions. To evaluate the language, we show for a list of informal requirements how to express them in FQL. Moreover, we present a test case generation engine for C programs and perform practical experiments with the sample specifications.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "University of Oxford", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Andreas Holzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holzer:Andreas", "Christian Schallhart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schallhart:Christian", "Michael Tautschnig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tautschnig:Michael", "Helmut Veith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veith:Helmut"], "pages": 10}
