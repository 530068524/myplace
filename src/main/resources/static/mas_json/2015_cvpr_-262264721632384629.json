We show that, under very stringent conditions, these are related to \u201cfeature descriptors\u201d commonly used in Computer Vision. Such conditions can be relaxed if multiple views of the same scene are available. We propose a sampling-based and a point-estimate based approximation of such a representation, compared empirically on image-to-(multiple)image matching, for which we introduce a multi-view wide-baseline matching benchmark, consisting of a mixture of real and synthetic objects with ground truth camera motion and dense three-dimensional geometry.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jingming Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jingming", "Nikolaos Karianakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karianakis:Nikolaos", "Damek Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Damek", "Joshua Hernandez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hernandez:Joshua", "Jonathan Balzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balzer:Jonathan", "Stefano Soatto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soatto:Stefano"], "pages": 10}
