{"title": "Opinion Spammer Detection in Web Forum.", "fields": ["radial basis function kernel", "test set", "spamming", "f1 score", "burstiness"], "abstract": "In this paper, a real case study on opinion spammer detection in web forum is presented. We explore user profiles, maximum spamicity of first posts of users, burstiness of registration of user accounts, and frequent poster set to build a model with SVM with RBF kernel and frequent itemset mining. The proposed model achieves 0.6753 precision, 0.6190 recall, and 0.6460 F1 score. The result is promising because the ratio of opinion spammers in the test set is only 0.98%.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Yu-Ren Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu=Ren", "Hsin-Hsi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hsin=Hsi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
