{"title": "Revisiting Reuse in Main Memory Database Systems.", "fields": ["query optimization", "cache", "central processing unit", "hash table", "query plan"], "abstract": "Reusing intermediates in databases to speed-up analytical query processing was studied in prior work. Existing solutions require intermediate results of individual operators to be materialized using materialization operators. However, inserting such materialization operations into a query plan not only incurs additional execution costs but also often eliminates important cache- and register-locality opportunities, resulting in even higher performance penalties. This paper studies a novel reuse model for intermediates, which caches internal physical data structures materialized during query processing (due to pipeline breakers) and externalizes them so that they become reusable for upcoming operations. We focus on hash tables, the most commonly used internal data structure in main memory databases to perform join and aggregation operations. As queries arrive, our  reuse-aware optimizer  reasons about the reuse opportunities for hash tables, employing cost models that take into account hash table statistics together with the CPU and data movement costs within the cache hierarchy. Experimental results, based on our prototype implementation, demonstrate performance gains of 2x for typical analytical workloads with no additional overhead for materializing intermediates.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kayhan Dursun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dursun:Kayhan", "Carsten Binnig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binnig:Carsten", "Ugur \u00c7etintemel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ccedil=etintemel:Ugur", "Tim Kraska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraska:Tim"], "pages": 15}
