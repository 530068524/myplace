We introduce a new direction to protect user privacy that evaluates LBSs with crowdsourced data and computation and eliminates the role of a location-based service provider. We focus on the group nearest neighbor (GNN) query that allows a group to meet at their nearest point of interest such as a restaurant that minimizes the total or maximum distance of the group. We develop a crowdsource-based approach, called PrivateMeetUp, to evaluate GNN queries in a privacy preserving manner and implement a working prototype of PrivateMeetUp.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology", "Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Tanzima Hashem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashem:Tanzima", "Mohammed Eunus Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Mohammed_Eunus", "Lars Kulik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulik:Lars", "Egemen Tanin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanin:Egemen", "Anthony Quattrone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quattrone:Anthony"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
