{"title": "Constant-Round Concurrent Zero Knowledge from P-Certificates.", "fields": ["mathematical proof", "zero knowledge proof", "hash function", "automated theorem proving", "concurrent computing"], "abstract": "We present a constant-round concurrent zero-knowledge protocol for NP. Our protocol relies on the existence of families of collision-resistant hash functions, and a new, but in our eyes, natural complexity-theoretic assumption: the existence of P-certificates-that is, \"succinct\" non-interactive proofs/arguments for P. As far as we know, our results yield the first constant-round concurrent zero-knowledge protocol for NP with an explicit zero-knowledge simulator based on any assumption.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "Cornell University", "Acad.
