{"title": "Unstructured P2P link lifetimes redux.", "fields": ["graph theory", "distributed computing", "graph", "stochastic modelling", "stochastic process", "computer network", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We revisit link lifetimes in random P2P graphs under dynamic node failure and create a unifying stochastic model that generalizes the majority of previous efforts in this direction. We not only allow non-exponential user lifetimes and age-dependent neighbor selection, but also cover both active and passive neighbor-management strategies, model the lifetimes of incoming and outgoing links, derive churn-related message volume of the system, and obtain the distribution of transient in/out degree at each user. We then discuss the impact of design parameters on overhead and resilience of the network.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Dayton", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "University of Dayton", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Zhongmei Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Zhongmei", "Daren B.
