Existing schemes mainly focus on the power transfer efficiency but overlook the health impairments caused by RF exposure. In this paper, we study the safe charging problem (SCP) of scheduling power chargers so that more energy can be received while no location in the field has electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exceeding a given threshold    $R_{t}$   . We show that SCP is NP-hard and propose a solution, which provably outperforms the optimal solution to SCP with a relaxed EMR threshold    $(1-\\epsilon )R_{t}$   . Testbed results based on 8 Powercast TX91501 chargers validate our results. Extensive simulation results show that the gap between our solution and the optimal one is only 6.7% when    $\\epsilon = 0.1$   , while a naive greedy algorithm is 34.6% below our solution.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "University of Minnesota", "Nanjing University", "Peking University", "Nanjing University", "University of Canterbury", "University of Minnesota", "Third Res.
