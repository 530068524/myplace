In this paper, we propose a complete, practical methodology for generating graphs that resemble a real graph of interest. The metrics of the original topology we target to match are the joint degree distribution (JDD) and the degree-dependent average clustering coefficient (c\u0305(k)). We start by developing efficient estimators for these two metrics based on a node sample collected via either independence sampling or random walks. Then, we process the output of the estimators to ensure that the target metrics are realizable. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm for generating topologies that have the exact target JDD and a c\u0305(k) close to the target. Extensive simulations using real-life graphs show that the graphs generated by our methodology are similar to the original graph with respect to, not only the two target metrics, but also a wide range of other topological metrics. Furthermore, our generator is order of magnitudes faster than state-of-the-art techniques.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "ETH Zurich", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Minas Gjoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gjoka:Minas", "Maciej Kurant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurant:Maciej", "Athina Markopoulou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markopoulou:Athina"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
