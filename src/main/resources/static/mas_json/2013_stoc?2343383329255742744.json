We design simple truthful mechanisms that under different distributional assumptions provide constant and sublogarithmic approximations to expected makespan. Our mechanisms are prior-independent in that they do not rely on knowledge of the job size distributions. Prior-independent approximations were previously known only for the revenue maximization objective [13, 11, 26]. In contrast to our results, in prior-free settings no truthful anonymous deterministic mechanism for the makespan objective can provide a sublinear approximation [3].", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Northwestern University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shuchi Chawla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chawla_0001:Shuchi", "Jason D.
