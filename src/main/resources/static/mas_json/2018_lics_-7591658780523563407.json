An axiomatisation has recently been proven to be complete for an approximatively universal fragment of quantum mechanics, the so-called Clifford+T fragment. We focus here on the expressive power of this axiomatisation beyond Clifford+T Quantum mechanics. We consider the full pure qubit quantum mechanics, and mainly prove two results: (i) First, the axiomatisation for Clifford+T quantum mechanics is also complete for all equations involving some kind of linear diagrams. The linearity of the diagrams reflects the phase group structure, an essential feature of the ZX-calculus. In particular all the axioms of the ZX-calculus are involving linear diagrams. (ii) We also show that the axiomatisation for Clifford+T is not complete in general but can be completed by adding a single (non linear) axiom, providing a simpler axiomatisation of the ZX-calculus for pure quantum mechanics than the one recently introduced by Ng&Wang.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Lorraine", "University of Lorraine", "University of Lorraine"], "authors": ["Emmanuel Jeandel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeandel:Emmanuel", "Simon Perdrix.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perdrix:Simon", "Renaud Vilmart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vilmart:Renaud"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
