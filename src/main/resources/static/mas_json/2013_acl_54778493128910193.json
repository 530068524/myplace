{"title": "ParGramBank: The ParGram Parallel Treebank.", "fields": ["treebank", "natural language processing", "grammar", "artificial intelligence", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "This paper discusses the construction of a parallel treebank currently involving ten languages from six language families. The treebank is based on deep LFG (LexicalFunctional Grammar) grammars that were developed within the framework of the ParGram (Parallel Grammar) effort. The grammars produce output that is maximally parallelized across languages and language families. This output forms the basis of a parallel treebank covering a diverse set of phenomena. The treebank is publicly available via the INESS treebanking environment, which also allows for the alignment of language pairs. We thus present a unique, multilayered parallel treebank that represents more and different types of languages than are available in other treebanks, that represents deep linguistic knowledge and that allows for the alignment of sentences at several levels: dependency structures, constituency structures and POS information.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "Microsoft", "University of Bergen", "University of Debrecen"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sebastian Sulger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sulger:Sebastian", "Miriam Butt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Butt:Miriam", "Tracy Holloway King.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King:Tracy_Holloway", "Paul Meurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meurer:Paul", "Tibor Laczk\u00f3.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laczk=oacute=:Tibor", "Gy\u00f6rgy R\u00e1kosi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=aacute=kosi:Gy=ouml=rgy", "Cheikh M.
