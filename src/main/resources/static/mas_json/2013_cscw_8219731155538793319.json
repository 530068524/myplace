{"title": "Re-coordinating activities: an investigation of articulation work in patient transfers.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "work systems", "computer science", "workflow"], "abstract": "The coordination of distributed activities is central to organizational work. The effective functioning of organizations hinges on their ability to manage interdependencies both within (intra-) and between (inter-) various departments. However, more than just the management of these individual interdependencies is required for smooth work system coordination. Organizations must also manage the interactions between intra- and inter-departmental activities. To investigate how these interactions manifest in organizational work, we conducted a field study examining patient transfer process. We highlight the  cross-boundary breakdowns  that occur when intra-departmental and inter-departmental activities related to patient transfers negatively affect each other. We then describe the  re-coordinating activities  performed to mitigate the effects of cross-boundary breakdowns. We discuss a framework of inter-departmental coordination work that describes the relationship between cross-boundary breakdowns and re-coordinating activities. Furthermore, we classify the re-coordinating activities as a type of articulation work performed by hospital staff. This research can help us develop empirically-driven and theoretically-based design guidelines for coordination tools to maintain overall organizational workflow by balancing the goals and requirements of the various departments.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["New York Academy of Medicine", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Joanna Abraham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abraham:Joanna", "Madhu C.
