{"title": "On the Impact of Mobility on Multicast Capacity of Wireless Networks.", "fields": ["distance vector multicast routing protocol", "xcast", "pragmatic general multicast", "ip multicast", "multicast address"], "abstract": "Analogous to the beneficial impact that mobility has on the throughput of unicast networks, this paper establishes that mobility can provide a similar gain in the order-wise growth-rate of the throughput for multicast networks. This paper considers an all-mobile multicast network, and characterizes its multicast capacity scaling. The scaling result shows that the growth-rate of the throughput in the all-mobile multicast network is order-wise higher compared to the all-static multicast network. Further, the paper considers a static-mobile hybrid multicast network, and establishes that, if there are sufficient number of mobile nodes (that is order-wise smaller than the total number of nodes) in the network, then mobile nodes can enhance the order behavior of the multicast throughput.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Bell Labs", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Jubin Jose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jose:Jubin", "Ahmed Abdel-Hadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdel=Hadi:Ahmed", "Piyush Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Piyush", "Sriram Vishwanath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vishwanath:Sriram"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
