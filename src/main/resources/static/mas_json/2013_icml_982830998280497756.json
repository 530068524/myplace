{"title": "Bayesian Games for Adversarial Regression Problems.", "fields": ["prior probability", "adversary model", "minimax", "bayesian game", "adversary"], "abstract": "We study regression problems in which an adversary can exercise some control over the data generation process. Learner and adversary have con flicting but not necessarily perfectly antagonistic objectives. We study the case in which the learner is not fully informed about the adversary's objective; instead, any knowledge of the learner about parameters of the adversary's goal may be re flected in a Bayesian prior. We model this problem as a Bayesian game, and characterize conditions under which a unique Bayesian equilibrium point exists. We experimentally compare the Bayesian equilibrium strategy to the Nash equilibrium strategy, the minimax strategy, and regular linear regression.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "SoundCloud Ltd. ...
