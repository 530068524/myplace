{"title": "Improving energy efficiency of Wi-Fi sensing on smartphones.", "fields": ["android", "mobile broadband", "cellular network", "mobile device", "accelerometer"], "abstract": "Mobile data usage over cellular networks has been dramatically increasing over the past years. Wi-Fi based wireless networks offer a high-bandwidth alternative for offloading such data traffic. However, intermittent connectivity, and battery power drain in mobile devices, inhibits always-on connectivity even in areas with good Wi-Fi coverage. This paper presents WiFisense, a system that employs user mobility information retrieved from low-power sensors (e.g., accelerometer) in smartphones, and further includes adaptive Wi-Fi sensing algorithms, to conserve battery power while improving Wi-Fi usage. We implement the proposed system in Android-based smartphones and evaluate the implementation in both indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi networks. Our evaluation results show that WiFisense saves energy consumption for scans by up to 79% and achieves considerable increase in Wi-Fi usage for various scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "departments": ["Deutsche Telekom", "University of Michigan", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "Deutsche Telekom"], "authors": ["Kyu-Han Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kyu=Han", "Alexander W.
