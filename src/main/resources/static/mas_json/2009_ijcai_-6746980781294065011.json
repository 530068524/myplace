In order to speed this process, we introduce a new class of memory-based heuristics, called true distance heuristics, that store true distances between some pairs of states in the original state space can be used for a heuristic between any pair of states. We provide a number of techniques for using and improving true distance heuristics such that most of the benefits of the all-pairs shortest-path computation can be gained with less than 1% of the memory. Experimental results on a number of domains show a 6- 14 fold improvement in search speed compared to traditional heuristics.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Nathan R.
