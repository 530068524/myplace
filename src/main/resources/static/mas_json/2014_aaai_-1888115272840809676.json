{"title": "Saturated Path-Constrained MDP: Planning under Uncertainty and Deterministic Model-Checking Constraints.", "fields": ["deterministic system", "dynamic programming", "probabilistic logic", "expected utility hypothesis", "markov decision process"], "abstract": "In many probabilistic planning scenarios, a system's behavior needs to not only maximize the expected utility but also obey certain restrictions. This paper presents Saturated Path-Constrained Markov Decision Processes (SPC MDPs), a new MDP type for planning under uncertainty with deterministic model-checking constraints, e.g., \"state s must be visited before s\", \"the system must end up in s\", or \"the system must never enter s\". We present a mathematical analysis of SPC MDPs, showing that although SPC MDPs generally have no optimal policies, every instance of this class has an e-optimal randomized policy for any e > 0. We propose a dynamic programming-based algorithm for finding such policies, and empirically demonstrate this algorithm to be orders of magnitude faster than its next-best alternative.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "ONERA, The Fren ... ulouse, France", "ONERA, The Fren ... ulouse, France"], "authors": ["Jonathan Sprauel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sprauel:Jonathan", "Andrey Kolobov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolobov:Andrey", "Florent Teichteil-K\u00f6nigsbuch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teichteil=K=ouml=nigsbuch:Florent"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
