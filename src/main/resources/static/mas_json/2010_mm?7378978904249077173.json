It becomes more difficult when target objects differ significantly from the query object due to changes in scale, viewpoint or style, not to mention partial occlusion or cluttered backgrounds. With the goal to retrieve and accurately locate the small object in the images, we formulate the object search as the problem of finding  subimages  with the largest mutual information toward the query object. Each image is characterized by a collection of local features. Instead of only using the query object for matching, we propose a discriminative matching using both positive and negative queries to obtain the mutual information score. The user can verify the retrieved subimages and improve the search results incrementally. Our experiments on a challenging logo database of 10,000 images highlight the effectiveness of this approach.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Motorola", "Motorola"], "authors": ["Jingjing Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Jingjing", "Junsong Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Junsong", "Yuning Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yuning", "Nitya Narasimhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narasimhan:Nitya", "Venu Vasudevan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasudevan:Venu", "Ying Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Ying"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
