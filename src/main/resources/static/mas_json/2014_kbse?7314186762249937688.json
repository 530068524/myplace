{"title": "Behavioral resource-aware model inference.", "fields": ["transmission control protocol", "debugging", "cache", "software bug", "software system"], "abstract": "Software bugs often arise because of differences between what developers think their system does and what the system actually does. These differences frustrate debugging and comprehension efforts. We describe Perfume, an automated approach for inferring behavioral, resource-aware models of software systems from logs of their executions. These finite state machine models ease understanding of system behavior and resource use.   Perfume improves on the state of the art in model inference by differentiating behaviorally similar executions that differ in resource consumption. For example, Perfume separates otherwise identical requests that hit a cache from those that miss it, which can aid understanding how the cache affects system behavior and removing cache-related bugs. A small user study demonstrates that using Perfume is more effective than using logs and another model inference tool for system comprehension. A case study on the TCP protocol demonstrates that Perfume models can help understand non-trivial protocol behavior. Perfume models capture key system properties and improve system comprehension, while being reasonably robust to noise likely to occur in real-world executions.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Tony Ohmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohmann:Tony", "Michael Herzberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herzberg:Michael", "Sebastian Fiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiss:Sebastian", "Armand Halbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halbert:Armand", "Marc Palyart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palyart:Marc", "Ivan Beschastnikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beschastnikh:Ivan", "Yuriy Brun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brun:Yuriy"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
