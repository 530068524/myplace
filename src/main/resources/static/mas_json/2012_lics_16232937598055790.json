{"title": "Deciding the Value 1 Problem for Probabilistic Leaktight Automata.", "fields": ["\u03c9 automaton", "nested word", "continuous spatial automaton", "mobile automaton", "quantum finite automata"], "abstract": "The value 1 problem is a decision problem for probabilistic automata over finite words: given a probabilistic automaton, are there words accepted with probability arbitrarily close to 1? This problem was proved undecidable recently. We sharpen this result, showing that the undecidability holds even if the probabilistic automata have only one probabilistic transition. Our main contribution is to introduce a new class of probabilistic automata, called leaktight automata, for which the value 1 problem is shown decidable (and PSPACE-complete). We construct an algorithm based on the computation of a monoid abstracting the behaviors of the automaton, and rely on algebraic techniques developed by Simon for the correctness proof. The class of leaktight automata is decidable in PSPACE, subsumes all subclasses of probabilistic automata whose value 1 problem is known to be decidable (in particular deterministic automata), and is closed under two natural composition operators.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["L'Abri", "L'Abri", "LIAFA, Univ.
