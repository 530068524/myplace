We use this framework to demonstrate that, in many of the models in which the POA has been studied, the POA in large games is much smaller than the worst-case bound. Our framework also differentiates between mechanisms with similar worst-case performance, such as simultaneous uniform-price auctions and greedy combinatorial auctions, thereby providing new insights about which mechanisms are likely to perform well in realistic settings.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Stanford University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Michal Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Michal", "Nicole Immorlica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Immorlica:Nicole", "Brendan Lucier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucier:Brendan", "Tim Roughgarden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roughgarden:Tim", "Vasilis Syrgkanis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Syrgkanis:Vasilis"], "pages": 14}
