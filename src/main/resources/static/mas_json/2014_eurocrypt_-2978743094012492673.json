There are multiple well-known schemes in the literature where the best known (adaptive) security proofs degrade exponentially in the maximum hierarchy depth. However, we do not have a rigorous understanding of why better proofs are not known. (For ABE, the analog of hierarchy depth is the maximum number of attributes used in a ciphertext.)", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Columbia University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Allison B.
