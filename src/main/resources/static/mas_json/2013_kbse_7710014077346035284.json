Understanding the correlation between feature selections and performance is important for stakeholders to be able to derive a program variant that meets their requirements. A major challenge in practice is to accurately predict performance based on a small sample of measured variants, especially when features interact. We propose a variability-aware approach to performance prediction via statistical learning. The approach works progressively with random samples, without additional effort to detect feature interactions. Empirical results on six real-world case studies demonstrate an average of 94% prediction accuracy based on small random samples. Furthermore, we investigate why the approach works by a comparative analysis of performance distributions. Finally, we compare our approach to an existing technique and guide users to choose one or the other in practice.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Jianmei Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jianmei", "Krzysztof Czarnecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czarnecki:Krzysztof", "Sven Apel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apel:Sven", "Norbert Siegmund.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siegmund:Norbert", "Andrzej Wasowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wasowski:Andrzej"], "pages": 11}
