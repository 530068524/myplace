In this setting,\nsensitive information is at risk of disclosure since published\ndata can be linked with arbitrary external data sources\nIn this paper we lay the foundations of privacy-preserving\ndata publishing (PPDP) in the context of Linked Data. We\nconsider anonymisations of RDF graphs (and, more generally,\nrelational datasets with labelled nulls) and define notions\nof safe and optimal anonymisations. Safety ensures that the\nanonymised data can be published with provable protection\nguarantees against linking attacks, whereas optimality ensures\nthat it preserves as much information from the original\ndata as possible, while satisfying the safety requirement. We\nestablish the complexity of the underpinning decision problems\nboth under open-world semantics inherent to RDF and\na closed-world semantics, where we assume that an attacker\nhas complete knowledge over some part of the original data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Bernardo Cuenca Grau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grau:Bernardo_Cuenca", "Egor V.
