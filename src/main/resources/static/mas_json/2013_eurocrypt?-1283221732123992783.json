In their model, each party interacts only once, with a single centralized server. Parties do not interact with each other; in fact, the parties need not even be online simultaneously.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Applied Communication Sciences", "Columbia University", "University of Montana", "George Washington University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["S.
