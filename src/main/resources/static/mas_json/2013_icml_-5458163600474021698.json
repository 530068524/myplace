Despite its lower iteration cost, we show that it achieves a similar convergence rate in duality gap as the full Frank-Wolfe algorithm. We also show that, when applied to the dual structural support vector machine (SVM) objective, this yields an online algorithm that has the same low iteration complexity as primal stochastic subgradient methods. However, unlike stochastic subgradient methods, the block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm allows us to compute the optimal step-size and yields a computable duality gap guarantee. Our experiments indicate that this simple algorithm outperforms competing structural SVM solvers.", "citation": "Citations (248)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Simon Lacoste-Julien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lacoste=Julien:Simon", "Martin Jaggi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaggi:Martin", "Mark W.
