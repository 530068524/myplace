{"title": "Solving the Traveling Tournament Problem by Packing Three-Vertex Paths.", "fields": ["trips architecture", "heuristic", "tournament", "hybrid algorithm", "schedule"], "abstract": "The Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP) is a complex problem in sports scheduling whose solution is a schedule of home and away games meeting specific feasibility requirements, while minimizing the total distance traveled by all the teams. A recently-developed \"hybrid\" algorithm, combining local search and integer programming, has resulted in best-known solutions for many TTP instances. In this paper, we tackle the TTP from a graph-theoretic perspective, by generating a new \"canonical\" schedule in which each team's three-game road trips match up with the underlying graph's minimum-weight P3-packing. By using this new schedule as the initial input for the hybrid algorithm, we develop tournament schedules for five benchmark TTP instances that beat all previously-known solutions.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Quest University", "National Institute of Informatics", "University of G\u00f6ttingen"], "authors": ["Marc Goerigk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goerigk:Marc", "Richard Hoshino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoshino:Richard", "Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawarabayashi:Ken=ichi", "Stephan Westphal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Westphal:Stephan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
