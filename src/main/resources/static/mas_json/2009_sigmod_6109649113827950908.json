Twitter, a popular microblogging tool has seen a lot of growth since it launched in October, 2006. In this paper, we present our observations of the microblogging phenomena by studying the topological and geographical properties of Twitter's social network. We find that people use microblogging to talk about their daily activities and to seek or share information. Finally, we analyze the user intentions associated at a community level and show how users with similar intentions connect with each other.", "citation": "Citations (3,950)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Ioannina", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "National University of Singapore", "National Bureau of Economic Research", "National Bureau of Economic Research", "NEC Laboratorie ... , Cupertino, CA", "NEC Laboratorie ... , Cupertino, CA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Adriane Chapman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chapman:Adriane", "H.
