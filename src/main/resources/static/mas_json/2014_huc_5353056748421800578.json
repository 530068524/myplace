{"title": "AirLink: sharing files between multiple devices using in-air gestures.", "fields": ["computer hardware", "file sharing", "embedded system", "gesture", "computer science"], "abstract": "We introduce AirLink, a novel technique for sharing files between multiple devices. By waving a hand from one device towards another, users can directly transfer files between them. The system utilizes the devices' built-in speakers and microphones to enable easy file sharing between phones, tablets and laptops. We evaluate our system in an 11-participant study with 96.8% accuracy, showing the feasibility of using AirLink in a multiple-device environment. We also implemented a real-time system and demonstrate the capability of AirLink in various applications.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Samsung", "University of Washington", "Samsung", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Ke-Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ke=Yu", "Daniel Ashbrook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ashbrook:Daniel", "Mayank Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Mayank", "Sung-Hyuck Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sung=Hyuck", "Shwetak Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Shwetak"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 5}
