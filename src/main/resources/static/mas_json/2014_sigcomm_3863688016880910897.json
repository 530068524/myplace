However, in scenarios that require packet processing to be redistributed across a collection of network function (NF) instances, simultaneously achieving all three goals requires a framework that provides efficient, coordinated control of both internal NF state and network forwarding state. To this end, we design a control plane called OpenNF. We use carefully designed APIs and a clever combination of events and forwarding updates to address race conditions, bound overhead, and accommodate a variety of NFs. Our evaluation shows that OpenNF offers efficient state control without compromising flexibility, and requires modest additions to NFs.", "citation": "Citations (336)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Aaron Gember-Jacobson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gember=Jacobson:Aaron", "Raajay Viswanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viswanathan:Raajay", "Chaithan Prakash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prakash:Chaithan", "Robert Grandl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grandl:Robert", "Junaid Khalid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khalid:Junaid", "Sourav Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Sourav", "Aditya Akella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akella:Aditya"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
