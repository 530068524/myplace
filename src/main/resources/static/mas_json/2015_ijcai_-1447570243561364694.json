{"title": "Verification of Knowledge-Based Programs over Description Logic Actions.", "fields": ["domain knowledge", "action language", "decidability", "description logic", "constructive"], "abstract": "A knowledge-based program defines the behavior of an agent by combining primitive actions, programming constructs and test conditions that make explicit reference to the agent's knowledge. In this paper we consider a setting where an agent is equipped with a Description Logic (DL) knowledge base providing general domain knowledge and an incomplete description of the initial situation. We introduce a corresponding new DL-based action language that allows for representing both physical and sensing actions, and that we then use to build knowledge-based programs with test conditions expressed in the epistemic DL. After proving undecidability for the general case, we then discuss a restricted fragment where verification becomes decidable. The provided proof is constructive and comes with an upper bound on the procedure's complexity.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Benjamin Zarrie\u00df.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zarrie=szlig=:Benjamin", "Jens Cla\u00dfen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cla=szlig=en:Jens"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
