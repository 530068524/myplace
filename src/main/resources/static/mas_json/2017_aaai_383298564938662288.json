On the other hand, recent studies show that language associated with an image can steer visual attention in the scene during our cognitive process. Inspired by this, we introduce a text-guided attention model for image captioning, which learns to drive visual attention using associated captions. For this model, we propose an exemplar-based learning approach that retrieves from training data associated captions with each image, and use them to learn attention on visual features. Our attention model enables to describe a detailed state of scenes by distinguishing small or confusable objects effectively. We validate our model on MS-COCO Captioning benchmark and achieve the state-of-the-art performance in standard metrics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Jonghwan Mun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mun:Jonghwan", "Minsu Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Minsu", "Bohyung Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Bohyung"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
