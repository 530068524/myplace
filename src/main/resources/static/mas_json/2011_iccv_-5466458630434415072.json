{"title": "Object recoloring based on intrinsic image estimation.", "fields": ["intrinsic value", "computer vision", "standard illuminant", "robustness", "image segmentation"], "abstract": "Object recoloring is one of the most popular photo-editing tasks. The problem of object recoloring is highly under-constrained, and existing recoloring methods limit their application to objects lit by a white illuminant. Application of these methods to real-world scenes lit by colored illuminants, multiple illuminants, or interreflections, results in unrealistic recoloring of objects. In this paper, we focus on the recoloring of single-colored objects presegmented from their background. The single-color constraint allows us to fit a more comprehensive physical model to the object. We demonstrate that this permits us to perform realistic recoloring of objects lit by non-white illuminants, and multiple illuminants. Moreover, the model allows for more realistic handling of illuminant alteration of the scene. Recoloring results captured by uncalibrated cameras demonstrate that the proposed framework obtains realistic recoloring for complex natural images. Furthermore we use the model to transfer color between objects and show that the results are more realistic than existing color transfer methods.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Shida Beigpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beigpour:Shida", "Joost van de Weijer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weijer:Joost_van_de"], "pages": 8}
