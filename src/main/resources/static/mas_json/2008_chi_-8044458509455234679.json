{"title": "Designing for bystanders: reflections on building a public digital forum.", "fields": ["covert", "bystander effect", "mobile computing", "software deployment", "electronic voting"], "abstract": "In this paper, we reflect on the design and deployment process of MAGICBoard, a public display deployed in a university setting that solicits the electronic votes and opinions of bystanders on trivial but amusing topics. We focus on the consequences of our design choices with respect to encouraging  bystanders  to interact with the public display. Bystanders are individuals around the large display who may never fully engage with the application itself, but are potential  contributors  to the system. Drawing on our recent experiences with MAGICBoard, we present a  classification of bystanders , and then discuss three design themes relevant to the design of systems for bystander use:  graduated proximal engagement, lowering barriers for interaction and supporting covert engagement .", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Anthony Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Anthony", "Matthias Finke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finke:Matthias", "Michael Blackstock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blackstock:Michael", "Rock Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Rock", "Meghan Deutscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deutscher:Meghan", "Rodger Lea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lea:Rodger"], "pages": 4}
