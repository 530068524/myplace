In this work we use a learning theoretic angle for studying submodular functions. We provide algorithms for learning submodular functions, as well as lower bounds on their learnability. In doing so, we uncover several novel structural results revealing both extremal properties as well as regularities of submodular functions, of interest to many areas.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of British Columbia", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Maria-Florina Balcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balcan:Maria=Florina", "Nicholas J.
