{"title": "Detecting Temporal Proposal for Action Localization with Tree-structured Search Policy.", "fields": ["sliding window protocol", "detector", "salient", "reinforcement learning", "tree structure"], "abstract": "Understanding the semantics in videos is a complex but crucial task in video analysis. This paper focuses on localizing category-independent events, actions or other semantics in an untrimmed video, referred as salient temporal proposal localization. Traditional methods like sliding window have a high computational cost due to the densely sampling of different video segments. We propose a reinforcement learning based method, which trains a localizer that learns a search policy that, instead of exploring every video segment, finds an optimal search path to locate a salient proposal based on the currently observing video segment in a tree structure, therefore reduces the number of video segments fed into the proposal detector. In each search step, a localizer is trained to iteratively select the next sub-region containing salient proposals to continue the search, and a proposal detector is trained to recognize salient proposal from the sub-regions. The experiments demonstrate that our method is able to precisely detect salient proposals with a comparable recall and with much fewer candidate windows.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Xinyang Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xinyang", "Siliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Siliang", "Yang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0009:Yang", "Zhou Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhou", "Yin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Yin", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
