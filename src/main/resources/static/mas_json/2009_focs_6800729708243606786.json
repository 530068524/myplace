The theorem was originally proved by Arora and Safra (J. ACM 45(1)) and Arora et al. (J. ACM 45(3)) using sophisticated algebraic tools. More than a decade later, Dinur (J. ACM 54(3)) gave a simpler and arguably more intuitive proof using alternative combinatorial techniques. One disadvantage of Dinur's proof compared to the previous algebraic proof is that it yields less efficient verifiers. In this work, we provide a combinatorial construction of PCPs with verifiers that are as efficient as the ones obtained by the algebraic methods. The result is the first combinatorial proof of the PCP theorem for (originally proved by Babai et al., STOC 1991), and a combinatorial construction of super-fast PCPs of Proximity for (first constructed by Ben-Sasson et al., CCC 2005).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Institute for Advanced Study", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "authors": ["Or Meir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meir:Or"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
