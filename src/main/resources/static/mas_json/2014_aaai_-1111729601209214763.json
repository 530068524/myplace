{"title": "Q-Intersection Algorithms for Constraint-Based Robust Parameter Estimation.", "fields": ["bounded function", "exact algorithm", "constraint programming", "boxicity", "intersection graph"], "abstract": "Given a set of axis-parallel n-dimensional boxes, the q- intersection is defined as the smallest box encompassing all the points that belong to at least q boxes. Computing the q-intersection is a combinatorial problem that allows us to handle robust parameter estimation with a numerical constraint programming approach. The q-intersection can be viewed as a filtering operator for soft constraints that model measurements subject to outliers. This paper highlights the equivalence of this operator with the search of q-cliques in a graph whose boxicity is bounded by the number of variables in the constraint network. We present a computational study of the q-intersection. We also propose a fast heuristic and a sophisticated exact q-intersection algorithm. First experiments show that our exact algorithm outperforms the existing one while our heuristic performs an efficient filtering on hard problems.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Toulouse", "University of Montpellier", "SupAgro", "LINA, EMN Nantes, France"], "authors": ["Cl\u00e9ment Carbonnel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carbonnel:Cl=eacute=ment", "Gilles Trombettoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trombettoni:Gilles", "Philippe Vismara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vismara:Philippe", "Gilles Chabert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chabert:Gilles"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
