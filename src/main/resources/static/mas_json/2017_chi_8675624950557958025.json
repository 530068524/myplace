{"title": "FDVT: Data Valuation Tool for Facebook Users.", "fields": ["the internet", "personally identifiable information", "multimedia", "valuation", "revenue"], "abstract": "The OECD, the European Union and other public and private initiatives are claiming for the necessity of tools that create awareness among Internet users about the monetary value associated to the commercial exploitation of their online personal information. This paper presents the first tool addressing this challenge, the Facebook Data Valuation Tool (FDVT). The FDVT provides Facebook users with a personalized and real-time estimation of the revenue they generate for Facebook. Relying on the FDVT, we are able to shed light into several relevant HCI research questions that require a data valuation tool in place. The obtained results reveal that (i) there exists a deep lack of awareness among Internet users regarding the monetary value of personal information, (ii) data valuation tools such as the FDVT are useful means to reduce such knowledge gap, (iii) 1/3 of the users testing the FDVT show a substantial engagement with the tool.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Charles III University of Madrid", "Charles III University of Madrid", "Charles III University of Madrid"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Caba\u00f1as.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caba=ntilde=as:Jos=eacute=_Gonz=aacute=lez", "\u00c1ngel Cuevas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cuevas:=Aacute=ngel", "Rub\u00e9n Cuevas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cuevas:Rub=eacute=n"], "pages": 11}
