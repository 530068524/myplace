{"title": "Constrained Pure Nash Equilibria in Polymatrix Games.", "fields": ["epsilon equilibrium", "best response", "risk dominance", "subclass", "correlated equilibrium"], "abstract": "We study the problem of checking for the existence of constrained pure Nash equilibria in a subclass of polymatrix games defined on weighted directed graphs. The payoff of a player is defined as the sum of nonnegative rational weights on incoming edges from players who picked the same strategy augmented by a fixed integer bonus for picking a given strategy. These games capture the idea of coordination within a local neighbourhood in the absence of globally common strategies. We study the decision problem of checking whether a given set of strategy choices for a subset of the players is consistent with some pure Nash equilibrium or, alternatively, with all pure Nash equilibria. We identify the most natural tractable cases and show NP or coNP-completness of these problems already for unweighted DAGs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "University of Liverpool"], "authors": ["Sunil Simon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simon:Sunil", "Dominik Wojtczak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wojtczak:Dominik"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
