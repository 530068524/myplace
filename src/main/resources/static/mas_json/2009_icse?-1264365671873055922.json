{"title": "Automatically finding patches using genetic programming.", "fields": ["legacy system", "delta debugging", "test case", "software bug", "genetic programming"], "abstract": "Automatic program repair has been a longstanding goal in software engineering, yet debugging remains a largely manual process. We introduce a fully automated method for locating and repairing bugs in software. The approach works on off-the-shelf legacy applications and does not require formal specifications, program annotations or special coding practices. Once a program fault is discovered, an extended form of genetic programming is used to evolve program variants until one is found that both retains required functionality and also avoids the defect in question. Standard test cases are used to exercise the fault and to encode program requirements. After a successful repair has been discovered, it is minimized using structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging. We describe the proposed method and report experimental results demonstrating that it can successfully repair ten different C programs totaling 63,000 lines in under 200 seconds, on average.", "citation": "Citations (513)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of New Mexico", "University of Virginia", "University of New Mexico"], "authors": ["Westley Weimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weimer:Westley", "ThanhVu Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:ThanhVu", "Claire Le Goues.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goues:Claire_Le", "Stephanie Forrest.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forrest:Stephanie"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 11}
