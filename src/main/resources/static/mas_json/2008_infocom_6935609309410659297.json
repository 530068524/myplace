In this paper, we consider a scenario where secondary users can opportunistically access unused spectrum vacated by idle primaries. We introduce two metrics to protect primary performance, namely collision probability and overlapping time. We present three spectrum access schemes using different sensing, back-off, and transmission mechanisms. We show that they achieve indistinguishable secondary performance under given primary constraints. We provide closed form analysis on secondary user performance, present a tight capacity upper bound, and reveal the impact of various design options, such as sensing, packet length distribution, back-off time, packet overhead, and grouping. Our work sheds light on the fundamental properties and design criteria on opportunistic spectrum access.", "citation": "Citations (393)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "Beijing Jiaotong University", "Sch. of Electro ...
