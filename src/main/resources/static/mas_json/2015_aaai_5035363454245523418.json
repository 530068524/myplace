Some theoretical analyses demonstrate that it can provide a better approximation of original problems than convex relaxations. However, designing an effective algorithm to solve nonconvex optimization problems remains a big challenge. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding and Reweighted Algorithm (ISTRA) to solve rank minimization problems using the nonconvex weighted nuclear norm as a low rank regularizer. We prove theoretically that under certain assumptions our method achieves a high-quality local optimal solution efficiently. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that the proposed ISTRA algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Xiaowei Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Xiaowei", "Linli Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Linli", "Yitan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yitan", "Zhiyuan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhiyuan", "Enhong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Enhong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
