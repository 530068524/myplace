{"title": "Comparing Health Information Sharing Preferences of Cancer Patients, Doctors, and Navigators.", "fields": ["information needs", "loneliness", "feeling", "breast cancer", "information sharing"], "abstract": "As technologies such as personal health records and symptom trackers become more common, we are seeing an increase in patients actively engaging in health tracking behaviors. Patient collected data can provide valuable insight for healthcare providers, particularly in the area of breast cancer. Thus far, little work has examined whether the health information that patients are willing to track and share aligns with the information needs of healthcare providers. Our work provides a comparison between the health information sharing preferences of breast cancer patients, doctors and navigators. We identify discrepancies between stakeholders' preferences, such as patients' hesitation to share feelings of loneliness, signifying where technology can play an important role in helping patients prioritize the health information shared with providers. We present design implications from this work to guide the development of future health information sharing tools that consider the differing needs of healthcare stakeholders.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Maia L.
