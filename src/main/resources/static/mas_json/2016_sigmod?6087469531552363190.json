In addition, the tools that are commonly used by performance engineers, such as compiler intrinsics, static analyzers or hardware performance counters are neither integrated with data management systems nor easy to learn. This fact makes it (unnecessarily) hard to educate engineers, to prototype and to optimize database query plans for modern hardware. To address this problem, we developed a system called Candomble that lets database performance engineers interactively examine, optimize and evaluate query plans using a touch-based interface. Candomble puts attendants in the place of a physical query optimizer that has to rewrite a physical query plan into a better equivalent plan. Attendants experience the challenges when ad-hoc optimizing a physical plan for processing devices such as GPUs and CPUs and capture their gained knowledge in rules to be used by a rule-based optimizer.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Holger Pirk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pirk:Holger", "Oscar Moll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moll:Oscar", "Sam Madden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madden:Sam"], "pages": 4}
