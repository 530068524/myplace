This paper presents a novel, efficient technique for verifying LTL specifications in a fully automated way. Our technique belongs to the category of Bounded Satisfiability Checking approaches, where LTL formulae are encoded as formulae of another decidable logic that can be solved through modern satisfiability solvers. The target logic in our approach is Bit-Vector Logic. We present our novel encoding, show its correctness, and experimentally compare it against existing encodings implemented in well-known formal verification tools.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Luciano Baresi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baresi:Luciano", "Mohammad Mehdi Pourhashem Kallehbasti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kallehbasti:Mohammad_Mehdi_Pourhashem", "Matteo Rossi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossi:Matteo"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
