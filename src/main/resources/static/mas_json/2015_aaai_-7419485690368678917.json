{"title": "Exploring the KD45 Property of a Kripke Model After the Execution of an Action Sequence.", "fields": ["kripke structure", "algorithm", "kripke semantics", "computer science"], "abstract": "The paper proposes a condition for preserving the KD45n property of a Kripke model when a sequence of update models is applied to it. The paper defines the notions of a primitive update model and a semi-reflexive KD45n (or sr-KD45n) Kripke model. It proves that updating a sr-KD45n Kripke model using a primitive update model results in a sr-KD45n Kripke model, i.e., a primitive update model preserves the properties of a sr-KD45n Kripke model. It shows that several update models for modeling well-known actions found in the literature are primitive. This result provides guarantees that can be useful in presence of multiple applications of actions in multi-agent system (e.g., multi-agent planning).", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["New Mexico State University", "New Mexico State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Tran Cao Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Tran_Cao", "Enrico Pontelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pontelli:Enrico", "Chitta Baral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baral:Chitta", "Gregory Gelfond.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelfond:Gregory"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
