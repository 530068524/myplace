{"title": "Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention.", "fields": ["coco", "machine translation", "backpropagation", "object detection", "visualization"], "abstract": "Inspired by recent work in machine translation and object detection, we introduce an attention based model that automatically learns to describe the content of images. We describe how we can train this model in a deterministic manner using standard backpropagation techniques and stochastically by maximizing a variational lower bound. We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence. We validate the use of attention with state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: Flickr9k, Flickr30k and MS COCO.", "citation": "Citations (2,237)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Kelvin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Kelvin", "Jimmy Ba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ba:Jimmy", "Ryan Kiros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiros:Ryan", "Kyunghyun Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Kyunghyun", "Aaron C.
