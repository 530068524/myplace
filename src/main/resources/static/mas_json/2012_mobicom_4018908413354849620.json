The use of correlatable symbol sequences provides two key advantages:  (i)  efficiency, as it permits a near order of magnitude reduction of the control time;  (ii)  robustness, because codes are short and easily detectable even at low SINR and even while a neighbor is transmitting data. We implement 802.11ec on an FPGA-based software defined radio. We perform a large number of experiments and show that, compared to 802.11 (with and without RTS/CTS), 802.11ec achieves a vast efficiency gain in conveying control information and resolves key throughput and fairness problems in the presence of hidden terminals, asymmetric topologies, and general multi-hop topologies.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Eugenio Magistretti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magistretti:Eugenio", "Omer Gurewitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurewitz:Omer", "Edward W.
