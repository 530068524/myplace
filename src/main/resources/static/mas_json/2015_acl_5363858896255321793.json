This is not always realistic, since they can be ambiguous. We propose a model for joint dependency parsing and multiword expressions identification, in which complex function words are represented as individual tokens linked with morphological dependencies. Our graph-based parser includes standard second-order features and verbal subcategoriza-tion features derived from a syntactic lexicon .We train it on a modified version of the French Treebank enriched with morphological dependencies. It recognizes 81.79% of ADV+que conjunctions with 91.57% precision, and 82.74% of de+DET determiners with 86.70% precision.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Centre d'immuno ... arseille-Luminy"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Alexis Nasr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nasr:Alexis", "Carlos Ramisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramisch:Carlos", "Jos\u00e9 Deulofeu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deulofeu:Jos=eacute=", "Andr\u00e9 Valli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valli:Andr=eacute="], "pages": 11}
