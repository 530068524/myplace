To capture some subtle structures among feature groups, we propose a new regularization called exclusive group l2,1-norm. It enforces the sparsity at the intra-group level by using l2,1-norm, while encourages the selected features to distribute in different groups by using l2 norm at the inter-group level. The proposed exclusive group l2,1-norm is capable of eliminating the feature correlations in the context of feature selection, if highly correlated features are collected in the same groups. To solve the generic exclusive group l2,1-norm regularized problems, we propose an efficient iterative re-weighting algorithm and provide a rigorous convergence analysis. Experiment results on real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new regularization and algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Samsung", "University of Rochester", "Philips", "Google"], "authors": ["Deguang Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Deguang", "Ji Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Ji", "Bo Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0006:Bo", "Xuan Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Xuan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
