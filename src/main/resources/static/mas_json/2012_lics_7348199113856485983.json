We establish that the free dialogue category is a category of dialogue games and total innocent strategies. The connection clarifies the algebraic and logical nature of dialogue games, and their intrinsic connection to linear continuations. The proof of the statement is based on an algebraic presentation of dialogue categories inspired by knot theory, and a factorization theorem established by rewriting techniques.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Lab.
