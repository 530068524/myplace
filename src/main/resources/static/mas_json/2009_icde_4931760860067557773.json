{"title": "Transaction Support for Log-Based Middleware Server Recovery.", "fields": ["logging", "middleware", "distributed transaction", "database transaction"], "abstract": "We have developed log-based recovery for middleware servers that access back-end transaction systems (DBMSs). Transactional consistency is provided between in-memory state stored in middleware servers and persistent state stored in transaction systems. A new logging method called results logging is exploited to ensure coordinated recovery of in-memory state with persistent database state. Results logging incurs low logging overhead for middleware servers and requires little or no modification to existing transaction systems. This makes our approach a practical coordinated recovery technique.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Northeastern University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Rui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Rui", "Betty Salzberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salzberg:Betty", "David B.
