Our method achieves an accelerated convergence rate on strongly convex smooth problems. Our method has only one parameter (a step size), and is radically simpler than other accelerated methods for finite sums. Additionally it can be applied when the terms are non-smooth, yielding a method applicable in many areas where operator splitting methods would traditionally be applied.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Australian National University"], "authors": ["Aaron Defazio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Defazio:Aaron"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
