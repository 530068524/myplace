Failures might for instance affect a part of the network that resides in a certain geographical region. In this paper, considering networks embedded in a two-dimensional plane, we study the problem of finding a critical region - that is, a part of the network that can be enclosed by a given elementary figure (a circle, ellipse, rectangle, square, or equilateral triangle) with a predetermined size - whose removal would lead to the highest network disruption. We determine that there is a polynomial number of non-trivial positions for such a figure that need to be considered and, subsequently, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem. Simulations on realistic networks illustrate that different figures with equal area result in different critical regions in a network.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Stojan Trajanovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trajanovski:Stojan", "Fernando A.
