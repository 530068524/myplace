Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have emerged within medical research in recent years for treating acute pain, and proved to be an effective strategy based on pain distraction. This paper describes a VR system designed for chronic pain patients. The system incorporates biofeedback sensors, an immersive virtual environment, and stereoscopic sound titled the \"Virtual Meditative Walk\" (VMW). It was designed to enable chronic pain patients to learn Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a form of meditation. By providing real-time visual and sonic feedback, VMW enables patients to learn how to manage their pain. A proof-of-concept user study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the VR system with chronic pain patients in clinical settings. Results show that the VMW was more effective in reducing perceived pain compared to the non-VR control condition.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Diane Gromala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gromala:Diane", "Xin Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Xin", "Amber Choo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choo:Amber", "Mehdi Karamnejad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karamnejad:Mehdi", "Chris D.
