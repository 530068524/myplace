Although of practical importance, this problem is known to be NP-hard in general. We propose a new type of MRF decomposition, submod-ular decomposition (SMD). Unlike existing decomposition approaches SMD decomposes the initial problem into sub-problems corresponding to a specific class label while preserving the graph structure of each subproblem. Such decomposition enables us to take into account several types of global constraints in an efficient manner. We study theoretical properties of the proposed approach and demonstrate its applicability on a number of problems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Moscow State University", "Moscow State University", "University College London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anton Osokin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osokin:Anton", "Dmitry P.
