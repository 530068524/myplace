{"title": "Helping Hands: Requirements for a Prototyping Methodology for Upper-limb Prosthetics Users.", "fields": ["design process", "3d printing", "community engagement", "iterative design", "social network"], "abstract": "This paper presents a case study of three participants with upper-limb amputations working with researchers to design prosthetic devices for specific tasks: playing the cello, operating a hand-cycle, and using a table knife. Our goal was to identify requirements for a design process that can engage the assistive technology user in rapidly prototyping assistive devices that fill needs not easily met by traditional assistive technology. Our study made use of 3D printing and other playful and practical prototyping materials. We discuss materials that support on-the-spot design and iteration, dimensions along which in-person iteration is most important (such as length and angle) and the value of a supportive social network for users who prototype their own assistive technology. From these findings we argue for the importance of extensions in supporting modularity, community engagement, and relatable prototyping materials in the iterative design of prosthetics.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Megan Hofmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofmann:Megan", "Jeffrey Harris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harris:Jeffrey", "Scott E.
