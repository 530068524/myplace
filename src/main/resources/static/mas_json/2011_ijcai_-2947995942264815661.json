{"title": "Group-Strategyproof Irresolute Social Choice Functions.", "fields": ["voting", "condorcet method", "strategyproof", "covering set", "phenomenon"], "abstract": "An important problem in voting is that agents may misrepresent their preferences in order to obtain a more preferred outcome. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has been shown to be inevitable in the case of resolute, i.e., single-valued, social choice functions. In this paper, we introduce a variant of Maskin-monotonicity that completely characterizes the class of pairwise irresolute social choice functions that are group-strategyproof according to Kelly's preference extension. The class is narrow but contains a number of appealing Condorcet extensions such as the minimal covering set and the bipartisan set, thereby answering a question raised independently by Barbera (1977) and Kelly (1977). These functions furthermore encourage participation and thus do not suffer from the no-show paradox (under Kelly's extension).", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Felix Brandt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brandt_0001:Felix"], "pages": 6}
