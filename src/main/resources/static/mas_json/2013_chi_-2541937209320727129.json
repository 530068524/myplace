To assist people to lift medium-weight objects without a complex structure or various costs, we focus on the phenomenon that our weight perception during handling objects is affected by visual properties. Our hypothesis is that this illusionary effect in weight perception can be applied to reduce fatigue while handling medium-weight objects without mechatronics-based physical assistance. In this paper, we propose an augmented reality system that changes the brightness value of an object in order to reduce fatigue while handling the object. We conducted two fundamental experiments to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Our results suggested that the system eliminates the need to use excess energy for handling objects and reduces fatigue during the handling task.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Yuki Ban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ban:Yuki", "Takuji Narumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narumi:Takuji", "Tatsuya Fujii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujii:Tatsuya", "Sho Sakurai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakurai:Sho", "Jun Imura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Imura:Jun", "Tomohiro Tanikawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanikawa:Tomohiro", "Michitaka Hirose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirose:Michitaka"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
