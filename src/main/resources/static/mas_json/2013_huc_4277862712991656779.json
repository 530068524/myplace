In today's aged society, ways to support the impaired gait of elderly people with a decline in physical function is in great demand. This paper proposes wearable projector-based gait assistance as a novel application of mobile projectors. The technical challenge is to compensate the projected image with the intended position and size during walking. To verify the concept, we developed a self-gait training assistance system that displays stride length information on the floor while the user is walking. We conducted a study with ten healthy older adults (ages: 76-91). The results show the effectiveness of visual clues in controlling stride length and elderly people's acceptance of the wearable projector device.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology", "Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology", "Tokyo Eisei Gak ... e, Tokyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Satoshi Murata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murata:Satoshi", "Masanori Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Masanori", "Kaori Fujinami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujinami:Kaori"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
