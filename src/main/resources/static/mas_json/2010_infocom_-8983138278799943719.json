Thus how to determine the \\textit{optimal grid size} in order to minimize energy consumption and prolong network lifetime becomes an important problem during the network planning and dimensioning phase. So far most existing work uses the average distances within a grid and between neighbor grids to calculate the average energy consumption, which we found largely underestimates the real value. In this paper, we propose, analyze and evaluate the energy consumption models in wireless sensor networks with probabilistic distance distributions. These models have been validated by numerical and simulation results, which shows that they can be used to optimize grid size and minimize energy consumption accurately. We also use these models to study variable-size grids, which can further improve the energy efficiency by balancing the relayed traffic in wireless sensor networks.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Yanyan Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yanyan", "Jianping Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan_0001:Jianping", "Lin Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai_0001:Lin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
