{"title": "Join Reordering by Join Simulation.", "fields": ["operator", "query optimization", "cardinality", "joins", "source data"], "abstract": "We introduce a framework for reordering join pipelines at runtime in a database system. This framework incorporates novel techniques for simulating the execution of a join pipeline using random samples and statistical summaries. Our simulation techniques provide accurate runtime cardinality estimates along all alternative execution paths of a join pipeline. These estimates are then utilized to compare costs of alternative execution paths in a dynamic fashion, and reorder the pipeline if a better alternative path is found. We describe simulation techniques for pipelines of different kinds of join operators. We present an experimental evaluation of a prototype implementation of our framework in an open source data manager. The results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the approach presented herein.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Chaitanya Mishra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mishra:Chaitanya", "Nick Koudas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koudas:Nick"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
