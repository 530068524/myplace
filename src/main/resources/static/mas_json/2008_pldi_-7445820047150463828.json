However, there are much less results about analyzing properties of array  contents . In this paper, we propose a way of using abstract interpretation for  discovering  properties about array contents in some restricted cases: one-dimensional arrays, traversed by simple \"for\" loops. The basic idea, borrowed from [GRS05], consists in partitioning arrays into symbolic intervals (e.g., [1, i  -- 1], [ i , i ], [ i  + 1, n ]), and in associating with each such interval  I  and each array  A  an abstract variable  A   I  ; the new idea is to consider  relational  abstract properties \u03c8( A   I  ,  B   I  , ...) about these abstract variables, and to interpret such a property pointwise on the interval  I : \u2200 l  \u2208  I , \u03c8( A [ l ],  B [ l ],...). The abstract semantics of our simple programs according to these abstract properties has been defined and implemented in a prototype tool. The method is able, for instance, to discover that the result of an insertion sort is a sorted array, or that, in an array traversal guarded by a \"sentinel\", the index stays within the bounds.", "citation": "Citations (153)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Nicolas Halbwachs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halbwachs:Nicolas", "Mathias P\u00e9ron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=eacute=ron:Mathias"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
