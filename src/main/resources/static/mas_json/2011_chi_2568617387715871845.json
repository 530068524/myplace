{"title": "Parameter selection in keyboard-based dialog boxes.", "fields": ["command line interface", "dialog box", "word error rate", "dialog system", "wimp"], "abstract": "Recent keyboard-based alternatives to WIMP interfaces do not have good support for commands that require multiple parameters. We remedy this by extending a previous design and mimicking dialog boxes to provide good visual feedback while still keeping the advantages of keyboard input. A laboratory study showed the new technique to be competitive with dialog boxes on speed and error rate, but strongly preferred over dialog boxes by experienced command line users. This is a marked improvement over the previous design, which was also preferred by the target user group but did not compete with dialog boxes in terms of performance.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jeff C.
