We developed a dyadic eye tracking methodology and metrics for studying the multimodal process of reference, and applied these techniques in an experiment using a naturalistic conversation elicitation task. We found systematic differences in linguistic and visual coordination between pairs of mobile and seated participants. Our results detail measurable interactions between referential form, gaze, and spatial context and can be used to enable the development of more natural collaborative user interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Darren Gergle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gergle:Darren", "Alan T.
