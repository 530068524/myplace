In the theory, belief functions are defined on Boolean algebras of events. In many applications of belief functions in real world problems, however, the objects that we manipulate is no more a Boolean algebra but a distributive lattice. In this paper, we employ Birkhoff@?s representation theorem for finite distributive lattices to extend the Dempster-Shafer theory to the setting of distributive lattices, which has a mathematical theory as attractive as in that of Boolean algebras. Moreover, we use this more general theory to provide a framework for reasoning about belief functions in a deductive approach on non-classical formalisms which assume a setting of distributive lattices. As an illustration of this approach, we investigate the theory of belief functions for a simple epistemic logic the first-degree-entailment fragment of relevance logic R by providing an axiomatization for reasoning about belief functions for this logic and by showing that the complexity of the satisfiability problem of a belief formula with respect to the class of the corresponding Dempster-Shafer structures is NP-complete.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China"], "authors": ["Chunlai Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Chunlai"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
