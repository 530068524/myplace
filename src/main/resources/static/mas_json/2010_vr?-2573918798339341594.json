We adapt a 2D picking metaphor to 3D selection in VE's by changing the projection and view matrices according to the position and orientation of a 6DOF pointing device and rendering a conic selection volume to an off-screen pixel buffer. This method works for triangulated as well as volume rendered objects, no explicit geometric representation is required.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Tobias Rick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rick:Tobias", "Anette von Kapri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapri:Anette_von", "Torsten W.
