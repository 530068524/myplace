{"title": "Jupiter Rising: A Decade of Clos Topologies and Centralized Control in Google's Datacenter Network.", "fields": ["software deployment", "bisection bandwidth", "clos network", "modular design", "network topology"], "abstract": "We present our approach for overcoming the cost, operational complexity, and limited scale endemic to datacenter networks a decade ago. Three themes unify the five generations of datacenter networks detailed in this paper. First, multi-stage Clos topologies built from commodity switch silicon can support cost-effective deployment of building-scale networks. Second, much of the general, but complex, decentralized network routing and management protocols supporting arbitrary deployment scenarios were overkill for single-operator, pre-planned datacenter networks. We built a centralized control mechanism based on a global configuration pushed to all datacenter switches. Third, modular hardware design coupled with simple, robust software allowed our design to also support inter-cluster and wide-area networks. Our datacenter networks run at dozens of sites across the planet, scaling in capacity by 100x over ten years to more than 1Pbps of bisection bandwidth.", "citation": "Citations (285)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Arjun Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Arjun", "Joon Ong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ong:Joon", "Amit Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Amit", "Glen Anderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anderson:Glen", "Ashby Armistead.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Armistead:Ashby", "Roy Bannon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bannon:Roy", "Seb Boving.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boving:Seb", "Gaurav Desai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desai:Gaurav", "Bob Felderman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felderman:Bob", "Paulie Germano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Germano:Paulie", "Anand Kanagala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanagala:Anand", "Jeff Provost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Provost:Jeff", "Jason Simmons.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simmons:Jason", "Eiichi Tanda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanda:Eiichi", "Jim Wanderer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wanderer:Jim", "Urs H\u00f6lzle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=lzle:Urs", "Stephen Stuart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stuart:Stephen", "Amin Vahdat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vahdat:Amin"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
