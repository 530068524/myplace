However, we observe that the latency of file system operations increases dramatically under heavy asynchronous I/Os in the background. A careful analysis reveals that most of the delay arises from an unexpected situation where the file system operations are blocked until one or more asynchronous I/O operations are completed. We call such an I/O - which is issued as an asynchronous I/O but has the property of a synchronous I/O as some tasks are blocked on it - Quasi-Asynchronous I/O (QASIO).\n\nWe classify the types of dependencies between tasks and QASIOs and then show when such dependencies occur in the Linux kernel. Also, we propose a novel scheme to detect QASIOs at run time and boost them over the other asynchronous I/Os in the I/O scheduler. Our measurement results on the latest smartphone demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively improves the responsiveness of file system operations.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Sungkyunkwan University", "Sungkyunkwan University", "Sungkyunkwan University"], "authors": ["Daeho Jeong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeong:Daeho", "Youngjae Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Youngjae", "Jin-Soo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Jin=Soo"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
