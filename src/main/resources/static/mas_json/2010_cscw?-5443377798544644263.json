Interviews and observations of 16 adults on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum reveal that many seek greater social connectedness and take advantage of interest-based online communities to foster successful, supportive relationships. However, CMC intensifies problems of trust, disclosure, inflexible thinking, and perspective-taking, making it difficult for some to maintain relationships. Interventions in the form of information visualization and CMC-specific social skills training are presented. Intervention considerations and participatory design opportunities are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Duquesne University"], "authors": ["Moira Burke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burke:Moira", "Robert E.
