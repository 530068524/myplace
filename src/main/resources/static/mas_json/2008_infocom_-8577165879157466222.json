The goal of maximizing a utility function of the injected traffic, while guaranteeing queue stability, is defined as an optimization problem where the input traffic intensity, channel loads, interface to channel binding and transmission schedules are jointly optimized by a dynamic algorithm. Due to the inherent NP-Hardness of the scheduling problem, a simple centralized heuristic is used to define a lower bound for the performance of the whole optimization algorithm. The behavior of the algorithm for different numbers of channels, interfaces and traffic flows is shown through simulations.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Padua", "DEI, Padova Univ., Padova"], "authors": ["Simone Merlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Merlin:Simone", "Nitin H.
