During a 6-week long user study in a living lab deployment with 60 participants, we collected their daily valuations of 4 categories of mobile PII (communication,  e.g . phonecalls made/received, applications,  e.g . time spent on different apps, location and media,  e.g . photos taken) at three levels of complexity (individual data points, aggregated statistics and processed,  i.e . meaningful interpretations of the data). In order to obtain honest valuations, we employ a reverse second price auction mechanism. Our findings show that the most sensitive and valued category of personal information is location. We report statistically significant associations between actual mobile usage, personal dispositions, and bidding behavior. Finally, we outline key implications for the design of mobile services and future markets of personal data.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Trento", "Telef\u00f3nica", "fondazione bruno kessler", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Telecom Italia"], "authors": ["Jacopo Staiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Staiano:Jacopo", "Nuria Oliver.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliver:Nuria", "Bruno Lepri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepri:Bruno", "Rodrigo de Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:Rodrigo_de", "Michele Caraviello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caraviello:Michele", "Nicu Sebe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebe:Nicu"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
