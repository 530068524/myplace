{"title": "Lean and full congruence formats for recursion.", "fields": ["recursion", "equivalence", "congruence", "semantics", "operational semantics"], "abstract": "In this paper I distinguish two (pre)congruence requirements for semantic equivalences and preorders on processes given as closed terms in a system description language with a recursion construct. A lean congruence preserves equivalence when replacing closed subexpressions of a process by equivalent alternatives. A full congruence moreover allows replacement within a recursive specification of subexpressions that may contain recursion variables bound outside of these subexpressions. I establish that bisimilarity is a lean (pre)congruence for recursion for all languages with a structural operational semantics in the ntyft/ntyxt format. Additionally, it is a full congruence for the tyft/tyxt format.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"], "authors": ["Rob J. van Glabbeek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glabbeek:Rob_J=_van"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
