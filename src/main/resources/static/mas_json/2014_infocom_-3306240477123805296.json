Further, it is simple and can be implemented on commodity low-power radios. Our approach builds on recent advances in the area of sparse Fourier transforms, which show that it is possible to reconstruct a sparse signal without sampling it at the Nyquist rate. To demonstrate our design, we implement it using 3 software radios, each sampling the spectrum at 50 MS/s, producing a device that captures 0.9 GHz \u2014 i.e., 6\u00d7 larger digital bandwidth than the three software radios combined. Finally, an extension of BigBand can perform GHz spectrum sensing even in scenarios where the spectrum is not sparse.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Haitham Hassanieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassanieh:Haitham", "Lixin Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Lixin", "Omid Abari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abari:Omid", "Ezzeldin Hamed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamed:Ezzeldin", "Dina Katabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katabi:Dina"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
