Transmission and storage of these descriptors are of critical importance in the context of mobile distributed camera networks and large indexing problems. We propose a framework for computing low bit-rate feature descriptors with a 20\u00d7 reduction in bit rate. The framework is low complexity and has significant speed-up in the matching stage. We represent gradient histograms as tree structures which can be efficiently compressed. We show how to efficiently compute distances between descriptors in their compressed representation eliminating the need for decoding. We perform a comprehensive performance comparison with SIFT, SURF, and other low bit-rate descriptors and show that our proposed CHoG descriptor outperforms existing schemes.", "citation": "Citations (339)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Nokia"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Vijay Chandrasekhar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandrasekhar:Vijay", "Gabriel Takacs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takacs:Gabriel", "David M.
