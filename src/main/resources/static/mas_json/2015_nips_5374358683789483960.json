We develop a framework for performing statistical inference on biclusters found by score-based algorithms. Since the bicluster was selected in a data dependent manner by a biclustering or localization algorithm, this is a form of selective inference. Our framework gives exact (non-asymptotic) confidence intervals and p-values for the significance of the selected biclusters.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jason D.
