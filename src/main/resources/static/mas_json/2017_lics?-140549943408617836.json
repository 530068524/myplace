{"title": "Data structures for quasistrict higher categories.", "fields": ["butterfly", "exploit", "algebraic number", "associative property", "adjunction"], "abstract": "We present new data structures for quasistrict higher categories, in which associativity and unit laws hold strictly. Our approach has low axiomatic complexity compared to traditional algebraic approaches, and gives a practical method for performing calculations in quasistrict 4-categories. It is amenable to computer implementation, and we exploit this to give a machine-verified algebraic proof that every adjunction of 1-cells in a quasistrict 4-category can be promoted to a coherent adjunction satisfying the butterfly equations.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Krzysztof Bar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bar:Krzysztof", "Jamie Vicary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vicary:Jamie"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
