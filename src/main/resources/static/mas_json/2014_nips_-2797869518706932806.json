In this paper, we explore a two-tiered notion of privacy where there is a small set of \"public\" users who are willing to share their preferences openly, and a large set of \"private\" users who require privacy guarantees. We show theoretically and demonstrate empirically that a moderate number of public users with no access to private user information already suffices for reasonable accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a new privacy concept for gleaning relational information from private users while maintaining a first order deniability. We demonstrate gains from controlled access to private user preferences.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yu Xin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xin:Yu", "Tommi S.
