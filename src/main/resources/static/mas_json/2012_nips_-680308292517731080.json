In this paper we observe that different models have relative advantages in different regions of the input space. This motivates our approach of using stagewise linear combinations of collaborative filtering algorithms, with non-constant combination coefficients based on kernel smoothing. The resulting stagewise model is computationally scalable and outperforms a wide selection of state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Joonseok Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joonseok", "Mingxuan Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Mingxuan", "Seungyeon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seungyeon", "Guy Lebanon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lebanon:Guy"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
