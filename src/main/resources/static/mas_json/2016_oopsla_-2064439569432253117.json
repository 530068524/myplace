We propose an expressive framework for implementing access control monitors for components. The basis of the framework is a novel concept: the authority environment. An authority environment associates rights with an execution context. The building blocks of access control monitors in our framework are authorization contracts: software contracts that manage authority environments. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our framework by implementing a diverse set of existing access control mechanisms and writing custom access control monitors for three realistic case studies.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Northwestern University", "University of Utah", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Scott Moore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moore:Scott", "Christos Dimoulas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimoulas:Christos", "Robert Bruce Findler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Findler:Robert_Bruce", "Matthew Flatt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flatt:Matthew", "Stephen Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Stephen"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2016", "pages": 20}
