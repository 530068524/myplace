{"title": "Test case prioritization for regression testing of service-oriented business applications.", "fields": ["xpath", "test case", "service orientation", "regression testing", "orchestration"], "abstract": "Regression testing assures the quality of modified service-oriented business applications against unintended changes. However, a typical regression test suite is large in size. Earlier execution of those test cases that may detect failures is attractive. Many existing prioritization techniques order test cases according to their respective coverage of program statements in a previous version of the application. On the other hand, industrial service-oriented business applications are typically written in orchestration languages such as WS-BPEL and integrated with workflow steps and web services via XPath and WSDL. Faults in these artifacts may cause the application to extract wrong data from messages, leading to failures in service compositions. Surprisingly, current regression testing research hardly considers these artifacts. We propose a multilevel coverage model to capture the business process, XPath, and WSDL from the perspective of regression testing. We develop a family of test case prioritization techniques atop the model. Empirical results show that our techniques can achieve significantly higher rates of fault detection than existing techniques.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Lijun Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Lijun", "Zhenyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Zhenyu", "W.
