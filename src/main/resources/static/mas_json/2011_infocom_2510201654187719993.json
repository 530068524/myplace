Security design for IMDs is complicated by the requirement that IMDs remain operable in an emergency when appropriate security credentials may be unavailable. In this paper, we introduce IMDGuard, a comprehensive security scheme for heart-related IMDs to fulfill this requirement. IMDGuard incorporates two techniques tailored to provide desirable protections for IMDs. One is an ECG based key establishment without prior shared secrets, and the other is an access control mechanism resilient to adversary spoofing attacks. The security and performance of IMDGuard are evaluated on our prototype implementation.", "citation": "Citations (164)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "Temple University", "National University of Defense Technology", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Fengyuan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Fengyuan", "Zhengrui Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Zhengrui", "Chiu Chiang Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chiu_Chiang", "Baosheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Baosheng", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
