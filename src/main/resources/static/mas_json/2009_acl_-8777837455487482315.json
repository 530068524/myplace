Using only morphological lexicons and unlabeled data, we learn a partially-supervised part-of-speech tagger and a lemmatizer which are combined using features on a dynamically linked dependency structure of words. We evaluate our model on English, Bulgarian, Czech, and Slovene, and demonstrate substantial improvements over both a direct transduction approach to lemmatization and a pipelined approach, which predicts part-of-speech tags before lemmatization.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Kristina Toutanova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toutanova:Kristina", "Colin Cherry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherry:Colin"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
