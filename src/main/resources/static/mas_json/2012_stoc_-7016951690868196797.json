{"title": "The freezing threshold for k-colourings of a random graph.", "fields": ["random graph", "phenomenon", "cavity method", "frost", "vertex", "graphical model", "random regular graph", "binary logarithm"], "abstract": "We rigorously determine the exact freezing threshold, r k  f , for k-colourings of a random graph. We prove that for random graphs with density above r k  f , almost every colouring is such that a linear number of variables are  frozen , meaning that their colours cannot be changed by a sequence of alterations whereby we change the colours of o(n) vertices at a time, always obtaining another proper colouring. When the density is below r k  f , then almost every colouring has at most o(n) frozen variables. This confirms hypotheses made using the non-rigorous cavity method. It has been hypothesized that the freezing threshold is the cause of the \"algorithmic barrier\", the long observed phenomenon that when the edge-density of a random graph exceeds hf k ln k(1+o k (1)), no algorithms are known to find k-colourings, despite the fact that this density is only half the k-colourability threshold.   We also show that r k  f  is the threshold of a strong form of reconstruction for k-colourings of the Galton-Watson tree, and of the graphical model.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Michael Molloy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Molloy:Michael"], "pages": 10}
