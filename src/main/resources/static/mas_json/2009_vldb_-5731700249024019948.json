{"title": "On Building a Search Interface Discovery System.", "fields": ["data web", "web navigation", "web api", "web development", "web modeling"], "abstract": "A huge portion of the Web known as the deep Web is accessible via search interfaces to myriads of databases on the Web. While relatively good approaches for querying the contents of web databases have been recently proposed, one cannot fully utilize them having most search interfaces unlocated. Thus, the automatic recognition of search interfaces to online databases is crucial for any application accessing the deep Web. This paper describes the architecture of the I-Crawler, a system for finding and classifying search interfaces. The I-Crawler is intentionally designed to be used in the deep web characterization surveys and for constructing directories of deep web resources.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Aalto University"], "authors": ["Denis Shestakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shestakov:Denis"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2009", "pages": 13}
