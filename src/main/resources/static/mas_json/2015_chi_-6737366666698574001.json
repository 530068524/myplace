{"title": "Balancing Boundaries: Using Multiple Devices to Manage Work-Life Balance.", "fields": ["cybernetics", "icts", "bring your own device", "mobile technology", "work life balance"], "abstract": "Information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to give us increased flexibility about when and where we choose to work and the freedom to deal with home tasks whilst at work. However more use of ICT for work during non-work time has been linked with negative outcomes including lower work and life satisfaction and increased stress. Previous work has suggested that in order to reduce some of these negative effects, people should adopt technology use strategies that aid separation of their home and work lives. In this paper we report the results of a questionnaire study investigating work-life balance boundary behaviours and technology use. We find that people use multiple devices as a way of creating boundaries between home and work, and the extent to which they do this relates to their boundary behaviour style. These findings have particular relevance given the increasing trend for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "Anglia Ruskin University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rowanne Fleck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fleck:Rowanne", "Anna Louise Cox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cox:Anna_Louise", "Rosalyn A.
