This improves the superpolynomial time complexity upper bound shown by Valiant and Paterson in 1975. Our main contribution is to prove that two deterministic one-counter automata are inequivalent if and only if they can be distinguished by a word of length polynomial in the size of the two input automata.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Technical University of Ostrava", "University of Bremen", "Technical University of Ostrava"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Stanislav B\u00f6hm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hm:Stanislav", "Stefan G\u00f6ller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml=ller:Stefan", "Petr Jancar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jancar:Petr"], "pages": 10}
