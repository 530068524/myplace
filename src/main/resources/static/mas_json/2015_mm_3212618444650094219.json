{"title": "Dependency-Aware Unequal Error Protection for Layered Video Coding.", "fields": ["network packet", "graph", "coding tree unit", "packet loss", "multiview video coding"], "abstract": "Layered video coding standards encode a high-quality video into multiple layers of unequal importance. Dependent layers that provide higher quality rely on their respective reference layers for successful reconstruction of transmitted video frames. Hence, if a video packet in a reference layer is corrupted or lost during transmission, all its dependent layers cannot be reconstructed successfully, and the resources consumed to transmit them are wasted. To address this problem, unequal error protection (UEP) techniques have been proposed to provide protection to each layer according to their importance. Nonetheless, the importance of a piece of video content is determined by not only the layering structure, but also visual features and encoding decisions. In this paper, we look deeper into the coding and prediction structure of layered encoded videos and model the the dependency among macroblocks and submacroblocks (the finest processing units of H.264 video coding standard) as a weighted graph. Based on this graph, we propose a dependency-aware UEP model that protects macroblocks according to their importance. Our simulation results show that the proposed UEP model outperforms the conventional UEP models for layered SVC videos by 3.76 dB of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when the channel packet loss rate is as high as 28%.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Mohammad Reza Zakerinasab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zakerinasab:Mohammad_Reza", "Mea Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Mea"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
