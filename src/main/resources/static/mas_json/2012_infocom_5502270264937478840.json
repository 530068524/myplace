In the smart grid, wireless networks have been proposed for efficient communications. However, the jamming attack that broadcasts radio interference is a primary security threat to prevent the deployment of wireless networks. Hence, spread spectrum systems with jamming resilience must be adapted to the smart grid to secure wireless communications. There have been extensive works on designing spread spectrum schemes to achieve feasible communication under jamming attacks. Nevertheless, an open question in the smart grid is how to minimize message delay for timely communication in power applications. In this paper, we address this problem in a wireless network with spread spectrum systems for the smart grid. By defining a generic jamming process that characterizes a wide range of existing jamming models, we show that the worst-case message delay is a U-shaped function of network traffic load. This indicates that, interestingly, increasing a fair amount of redundant traffic, called camouflage, can improve the worst-case delay performance. We demonstrate via experiments that transmitting camouflage traffic can decrease the probability that a message is not delivered on time in order of magnitude for smart grid applications.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "Research Triangle Park"], "authors": ["Zhuo Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhuo", "Wenye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenye", "Cliff Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Cliff"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
