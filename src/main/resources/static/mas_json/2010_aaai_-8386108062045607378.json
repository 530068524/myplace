Our algorithm is based on the sublinear filtering algorithm for binary knapsack constraints by Katriel et al. and achieves similar speed-ups of one to two orders of magnitude when compared with its linear-time counterpart. We also show that the representation of bounded knapsacks as binary knapsacks leads to ineffective filtering behavior. Experiments on standard knapsack benchmarks show that the new algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods for handling bounded knapsack constraints.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Yuri Malitsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malitsky:Yuri", "Meinolf Sellmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sellmann:Meinolf", "Radoslaw Szymanek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szymanek:Radoslaw"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
