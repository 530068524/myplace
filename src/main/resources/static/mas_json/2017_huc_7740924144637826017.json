{"title": "TweetCount: urban insights by counting tweets.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "land use", "grid", "urban computing", "data mining"], "abstract": "This paper characterizes an urban region using time series of geotagged tweet counts. Time series are constructed for each cell in a rectangular grid. We show how simple, anonymous tweet counts in the cells can be used to classify the cells into urban land use profiles based on the number of residences and businesses. We discover that Twitter activity for a certain short time of day is especially indicative of a region's profile. We go on to analyze the cells and profiles in a novel way by looking at their ability to predict tweet counts in other parts of the region.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of New Hampshire", "University of New Hampshire"], "authors": ["John Krumm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krumm:John", "Andrew L.
