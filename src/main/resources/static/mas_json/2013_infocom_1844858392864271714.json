{"title": "HBaseMQ: A distributed message queuing system on clouds with HBase.", "fields": ["message broker", "atomicity", "message queue", "scalability", "message passing"], "abstract": "Message queuing systems can be used to support a plethora of fundamental services in distributed systems. This paper presents HBaseMQ, the first distributed message queuing system based on bare-bones HBase. HBaseMQ directly inherits HBase's properties such as scalability and fault tolerance, enabling HBase users to rapidly instantiate a message queuing system with no extra program deployment or modification to HBase. As a result, HBaseMQ effectively enhances the data processing capability of an existing HBase installation. HBaseMQ supports reliable and total order message delivery with \u201cat least once\u201d or \u201cat most once\u201d message delivery guarantees with no limit on message size. Furthermore, HBaseMQ provides atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability on any operation over messages.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Chen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chen", "Xue Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Xue"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
