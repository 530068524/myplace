Our approach builds on ideas previously developed in the context of covert multiparty computation [Chandran et al., FOCS\u201907] even though we do not seek covert security. Using our new approach, we obtain the following results:\n\n\nA five round MPC protocol based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption.\n\n\nA four round MPC protocol based on one-way permutations and sub-exponentially secure DDH. This result is optimal in the number of rounds.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "authors": ["Prabhanjan Ananth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ananth:Prabhanjan", "Arka Rai Choudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhuri:Arka_Rai", "Abhishek Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0002:Abhishek"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 32}
