The trial demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in performance among those using the game. We discuss differences between our work and a previous trial that showed no performance improvement from an extrinsically linked educational game, and present hypotheses as to why the game structure we used may be effective within our chosen deployment environment.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "Games Faction L ...
