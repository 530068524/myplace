{"title": "On the limits of black-box reductions in mechanism design.", "fields": ["job shop scheduling", "oracle", "explicit knowledge", "ask price", "mechanism design"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of converting an arbitrary approximation algorithm for a single-parameter optimization problem into a computationally efficient truthful mechanism. We ask for reductions that are black-box, meaning that they require only oracle access to the given algorithm and in particular do not require explicit knowledge of the problem constraints. Such a reduction is known to be possible, for example, for the social welfare objective when the goal is to achieve Bayesian truthfulness and preserve social welfare in expectation. We show that a black-box reduction for the social welfare objective is not possible if the resulting mechanism is required to be truthful in expectation and to preserve the worst-case approximation ratio of the algorithm to within a subpolynomial factor. Further, we prove that for other objectives such as makespan, no black-box reduction is possible even if we only require Bayesian truthfulness and an average-case performance guarantee.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Northwestern University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shuchi Chawla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chawla_0001:Shuchi", "Nicole Immorlica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Immorlica:Nicole", "Brendan Lucier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucier:Brendan"], "pages": 14}
