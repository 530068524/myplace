{"title": "Eavesdropping: audience interaction in networked audio performance.", "fields": ["social connectedness", "client server model", "computer music", "auditory display", "eavesdropping"], "abstract": "Eavesdropping is an internet-based, interactive audio system that explores network mediated, musical performance in shared public spaces. The project aims to develop an environment which increases audience interaction and connectedness in a localized, computer-controlled performance. The system is a client-server architecture made of three components: (1) an audio preparation interface, (2) an interactive performance interface, and (3) a machine learning-based conductor. An artificial conductor mixes an acoustic ecology based on mood data entered by participants while learning from their feedback. Technicalities and early evaluation are presented.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Jack Stockholm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stockholm:Jack", "Philippe Pasquier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasquier:Philippe"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
