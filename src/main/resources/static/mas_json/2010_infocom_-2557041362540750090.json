{"title": "Tracking Skype VoIP Calls Over The Internet.", "fields": ["network packet", "encryption", "origination", "voice over ip", "peer to peer"], "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) VoIP calls such as those provided by Skype have been becoming popular due to their quality-of-service, free of cost, security and convenience. Skype is a distributed P2P network with no centralized call servers. Calls traverse through a myriad of possible paths before reaching to the destination and each packet is encrypted with $256$ bit AES encryption. In this paper, we are particularly interested in tracing out from this entangled web of peer nodes, who has called a \\emph{target subscriber} or to whom the \\emph{target subscriber} is calling. To this end, we present a transparent packet marking scheme that not only determines the origination and destination of a call but also the path taken through various hosts in P2P networks.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "George Mason University", "George Mason University", "Technology Deve ...
