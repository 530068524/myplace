The construction achieves better parameters and is simpler than that given in the seminal work of Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [SICOMP '99]. The key to our construction is a new notion of \"next-block pseudoentropy\", which is inspired by the notion of \"inaccessible entropy\" recently introduced in [Haitner, Reingold, Vadhan, Wee, STOC '09]. An additional advantage over previous constructions is that our pseudorandom generators are parallelizable and invoke the one-way function in a non-adaptive manner. Using [Applebaum, Ishai, Kushilevitz, SICOMP '06], this implies the existence of pseudorandom generators in NC^0 based on the existence of one-way functions in NC^1.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Harvard University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Iftach Haitner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haitner:Iftach", "Omer Reingold.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reingold:Omer", "Salil P.
