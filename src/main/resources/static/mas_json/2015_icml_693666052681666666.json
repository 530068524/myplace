{"title": "The Hedge Algorithm on a Continuum.", "fields": ["expected loss", "regular polygon", "online optimization", "regret", "convexity"], "abstract": "We consider an online optimization problem on a compact subset S \u2282 Rn (not necessarily convex), in which a decision maker chooses, at each iteration t, a probability distribution x(t) over S, and seeks to minimize a cumulative expected loss, \u03a3t=1T Es\u223cx(t) [l(t)(s)], where l(t) is a Lipschitz loss function revealed at the end of iteration t. Building on previous work, we propose a generalized Hedge algorithm and show a O(\u221atlogt) bound on the regret when the losses are uniformly Lipschitz and S is uniformly fat (a weaker condition than convexity). Finally, we propose a generalization to the dual averaging method on the set of Lebesgue-continuous distributions over S.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Walid Krichene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krichene:Walid", "Maximilian Balandat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balandat:Maximilian", "Claire J.
