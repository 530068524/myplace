{"title": "Light-Weight Contexts: An OS Abstraction for Safety and Performance.", "fields": ["isolation", "file descriptor", "rollback", "thread", "privilege separation"], "abstract": "We introduce a new OS abstraction--light-weight contexts (lwCs)--that provides independent units of protection, privilege, and execution state within a process. A process may include several lwCs, each with possibly different views of memory, file descriptors, and access capabilities. lwCs can be used to efficiently implement roll-back (process can return to a prior recorded state), isolated address spaces (lwCs within the process may have different views of memory, e.g., isolating sensitive data from network-facing components or isolating different user sessions), and privilege separation (in-process reference monitors can arbitrate and control access).\n\nlwCs can be implemented efficiently: the overhead of a lwC is proportional to the amount of memory exclusive to the lwC; switching lwCs is quicker than switching kernel threads within the same process. We describe the lwC abstraction and API, and an implementation of lwCs within the FreeBSD 11.0 kernel. Finally, we present an evaluation of common usage patterns, including fast rollback, session isolation, sensitive data isolation, and inprocess reference monitoring, using Apache, nginx, PHP, and OpenSSL.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["James Litton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Litton:James", "Anjo Vahldiek-Oberwagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vahldiek=Oberwagner:Anjo", "Eslam Elnikety.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elnikety:Eslam", "Deepak Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg_0001:Deepak", "Bobby Bhattacharjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacharjee:Bobby", "Peter Druschel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Druschel:Peter"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2016", "pages": 16}
