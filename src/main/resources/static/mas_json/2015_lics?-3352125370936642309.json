We give faster algorithms for the computation of the winning set for (1) one-pair Streett objectives (aka parity-3 problem) in game graphs and (2) for k-pair Streett objectives in graphs. For both problems this represents the first improvement in asymptotic running time in 15 years.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University of Vienna", "University of Vienna"], "authors": ["Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Monika Henzinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henzinger:Monika", "Veronika Loitzenbauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loitzenbauer:Veronika"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
