Yet, predominant societal views contribute to the positioning of individuals with dementia as deficient and declining, and treat technology as filling a gap left by impairment. We present the perspective of  critical dementia  as a way of reflecting on these views in the context of recent epistemological shifts in HCI. In addition to articulating how HCI can leverage the perspective of critical dementia, we present a case analysis of technology design in art therapy involving people with dementia aimed at challenging conventional narratives. This paper calls attention to and helps solidify an agenda for how the CHI community approaches dementia, design, and technology.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Mather LifeWays ... anston, IL, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Amanda Lazar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazar:Amanda", "Caroline Edasis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edasis:Caroline", "Anne Marie Piper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piper:Anne_Marie"], "pages": 14}
