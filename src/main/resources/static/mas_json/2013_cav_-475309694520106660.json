Modern multiprocessors' execution models make this problem even harder. Modelling program executions with partial orders rather than interleavings addresses both issues: we obtain an efficient encoding into integer difference logic for bounded model checking that enables first-time formal verification of deployed concurrent systems code. We implemented the encoding in the CBMC tool and present experiments over a wide range of memory models, including SC, Intel x86 and IBM Power. Our experiments include core parts of PostgreSQL, the Linux kernel and the Apache HTTP server.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University College London", "University of Oxford", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Jade Alglave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alglave:Jade", "Daniel Kroening.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kroening:Daniel", "Michael Tautschnig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tautschnig:Michael"], "pages": 17}
