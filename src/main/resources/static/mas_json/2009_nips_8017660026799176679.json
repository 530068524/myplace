{"title": "Fast Image Deconvolution using Hyper-Laplacian Priors.", "fields": ["lookup table", "quartic function", "laplace operator", "deblurring", "iteratively reweighted least squares"], "abstract": "The heavy-tailed distribution of gradients in natural scenes have proven effective priors for a range of problems such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution. These distributions are well modeled by a hyper-Laplacian (p(x) \u221d e-k|x|\u03b1 ), typically with 0.5 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0.8. However, the use of sparse distributions makes the problem non-convex and impractically slow to solve for multi-megapixel images. In this paper we describe a deconvolution approach that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques that use hyper-Laplacian priors. We adopt an alternating minimization scheme where one of the two phases is a non-convex problem that is separable over pixels. This per-pixel sub-problem may be solved with a lookup table (LUT). Alternatively, for two specific values of \u03b1, 1/2 and 2/3 an analytic solution can be found, by finding the roots of a cubic and quartic polynomial, respectively. Our approach (using either LUTs or analytic formulae) is able to deconvolve a 1 megapixel image in less than ~3 seconds, achieving comparable quality to existing methods such as iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) that take ~20 minutes. Furthermore, our method is quite general and can easily be extended to related image processing problems, beyond the deconvolution application demonstrated.", "citation": "Citations (832)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Dilip Krishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnan:Dilip", "Rob Fergus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fergus:Rob"], "pages": 9}
