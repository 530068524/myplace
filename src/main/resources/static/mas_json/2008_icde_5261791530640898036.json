{"title": "Efficient Information Extraction over Evolving Text Data.", "fields": ["text corpus", "scratch", "snapshot", "debugging", "computer integrated manufacturing"], "abstract": "Most current information extraction (IE) approaches have considered only static text corpora, over which we typically have to apply IE only once. Many real-world text corpora however are dynamic. They evolve over time, and to keep extracted information up to date, we often must apply IE repeatedly, to consecutive corpus snapshots. We describe Cyclex, an approach that efficiently executes such repeated IE, by recycling previous IE efforts. Specifically, given a current corpus snapshot U, Cyclex identifies text portions of U that also appear in the previous corpus snapshot V. Since Cyclex has already executed IE over V, it can now recycle the IE results of these parts, by combining these results with the results of executing IE over the remaining parts of U, to produce the complete IE results for U. Realizing Cyclex raises many challenges, including modeling information extractors, exploring the trade-off between runtime and completeness in identifying overlapping text, and making informed, cost-based decisions between redoing IE from scratch and recycling previous IE results. We describe initial solutions to these challenges, and experiments over two real-world data sets that demonstrate the utility of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Duke University", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Fei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0002:Fei", "AnHai Doan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doan:AnHai", "Jun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Jun", "Raghu Ramakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramakrishnan:Raghu"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
