{"title": "A Practical Cryptanalysis of the Algebraic Eraser.", "fields": ["algebraic eraser", "permutation group", "matrix group", "trademark", "cryptanalysis"], "abstract": "We present a novel cryptanalysis of the Algebraic Eraser primitive. This key agreement scheme, based on techniques from permutation groups, matrix groups and braid groups, is proposed as an underlying technology for ISO/IEC 29167-20, which is intended for authentication of RFID tags. SecureRF, the company owning the trademark Algebraic Eraser, markets it as suitable in general for lightweight environments such as RFID tags and other IoT applications. Our attack is practical on standard hardware: for parameter sizes corresponding to claimed 128-bit security, our implementation recovers the shared key using less than 8 CPU hours, and less than 64i\u00be?MB of memory.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "Bar-Ilan University"], "authors": ["Adi Ben-Zvi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Zvi:Adi", "Simon R.
