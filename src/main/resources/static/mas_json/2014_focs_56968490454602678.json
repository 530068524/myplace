We argue that this theorem sheds light on the problem of the evolution of complex adaptations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Adi Livnat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Livnat:Adi", "Christos H.
