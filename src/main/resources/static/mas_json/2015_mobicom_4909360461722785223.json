{"title": "Performance Characterization and Call Reliability Diagnosis Support for Voice over LTE.", "fields": ["operator", "user experience design", "software deployment", "stress testing", "sound quality"], "abstract": "To understand VoLTE performance in a commercial deployment, in this paper we conduct the first comprehensive performance characterization of commercially deployed VoLTE, and compare with legacy call and over-the-top (OTT) VoIP call. We confirm that VoLTE excels in most metrics such as audio quality, but its call reliability still lags behind legacy call for all the three major U.S. operators. We propose an on-device VoLTE problem detection tool, which can capture new types of problems concerning audio quality with high accuracy and minimum overhead, and perform stress testing on VoLTE call's reliability. We discover 3 instances of problems in the early deployment of VoLTE lying in the protocol design and implementation. Although the identified problems are all concerned with the immature LTE coverage in the current deployment, we find that they can cause serious impairment on user experience and are urgent to be solved in the developing stage. For example, one such instance can lead to up to 50-second-long muting problem during a VoLTE call! We perform in-depth cross-layer analysis and find that the causes are rooted in the lack of coordination among protocols designed for different purposes, and invalid assumptions made by protocols used in existing infrastructure when integrated with VoLTE. We summarize learnt lessons and suggest solutions.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "T-Mobile US, Inc.", "T-Mobile US, Inc."], "authors": ["Yunhan Jack Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yunhan_Jack", "Qi Alfred Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qi_Alfred", "Zhuoqing Morley Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Zhuoqing_Morley", "Jie Hui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hui:Jie", "Kranthi Sontineni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sontineni:Kranthi", "Alex Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Alex", "Samson Kwong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwong:Samson", "Kevin Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Kevin"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
