{"title": "Improving restore speed for backup systems that use inline chunk-based deduplication.", "fields": ["data deduplication", "exploit", "cache", "backup", "cpu cache"], "abstract": "Slow restoration due to chunk fragmentation is a serious problem facing inline chunk-based data deduplication systems: restore speeds for the most recent backup can drop orders of magnitude over the lifetime of a system. We study three techniques--increasing cache size, container capping, and using a forward assembly area-- for alleviating this problem. Container capping is an ingest-time operation that reduces chunk fragmentation at the cost of forfeiting some deduplication, while using a forward assembly area is a new restore-time caching and prefetching technique that exploits the perfect knowledge of future chunk accesses available when restoring a backup to reduce the amount of RAM required for a given level of caching at restore time.\n\nWe show that using a larger cache per stream--we see continuing benefits even up to 8 GB--can produce up to a 5-16X improvement, that giving up as little as 8% deduplication with capping can yield a 2-6X improvement, and that using a forward assembly area is strictly superior to LRU, able to yield a 2-4X improvement while holding the RAM budget constant.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "HP Storage"], "authors": ["Mark Lillibridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lillibridge:Mark", "Kave Eshghi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eshghi:Kave", "Deepavali Bhagwat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhagwat:Deepavali"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2013", "pages": 16}
