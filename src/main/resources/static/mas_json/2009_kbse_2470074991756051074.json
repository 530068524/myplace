{"title": "Adding Examples into Java Documents.", "fields": ["feature extraction", "java", "application programming interface", "semantics", "search engine"], "abstract": "Code examples play an important role to explain the usage of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but most API documents do not provide sufficient code examples. For example, for the JDK 5 documents (JavaDocs), only 2% of APIs have code examples. In this paper, we propose a technique that automatically augments API documents with code examples. Our approach finds and embeds code examples for more than 75% of the APIs in JavaDocs 5.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Jinhan Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jinhan", "Sanghoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sanghoon", "Seung-won Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Seung=won", "Sunghun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Sunghun"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
