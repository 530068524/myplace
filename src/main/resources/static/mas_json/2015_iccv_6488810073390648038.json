{"title": "Pose-Invariant 3D Face Alignment.", "fields": ["invariant", "point distribution model", "projection", "normal", "3d pose estimation"], "abstract": "Face alignment aims to estimate the locations of a set of landmarks for a given image. This problem has received much attention as evidenced by the recent advancement in both the methodology and performance. However, most of the existing works neither explicitly handle face images with arbitrary poses, nor perform large-scale experiments on non-frontal and profile face images. In order to address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel face alignment algorithm that estimates both 2D and 3D landmarks and their 2D visibilities for a face image with an arbitrary pose. By integrating a 3D point distribution model, a cascaded coupled-regressor approach is designed to estimate both the camera projection matrix and the 3D landmarks. Furthermore, the 3D model also allows us to automatically estimate the 2D landmark visibilities via surface normal. We use a substantially larger collection of all-pose face images to evaluate our algorithm and demonstrate superior performances than the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Amin Jourabloo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jourabloo:Amin", "Xiaoming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Xiaoming"], "pages": 9}
