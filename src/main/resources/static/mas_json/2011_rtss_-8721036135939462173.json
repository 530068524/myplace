{"title": "RUN: Optimal Multiprocessor Real-Time Scheduling via Reduction to Uniprocessor.", "fields": ["scheduling", "upper and lower bounds", "multiprocessor scheduling", "multiprocessing", "uniprocessor system"], "abstract": "Optimal multiprocessor real-time schedulers incur significant overhead for preemptions and migrations. We present RUN, an efficient scheduler that reduces the multiprocessor problem to a series of uniprocessor problems. RUN significantly outperforms existing optimal algorithms with an upper bound of O(\\log m) average preemptions per job on m processors (less than 3 per job in all of our simulated task sets) and reduces to Partitioned EDF whenever a proper partitioning is found.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Fed.
