We show: An O(k log n)-time randomized algorithm for the case where the input signal has at most k non-zero Fourier coefficients, and An O(k log n log(n/k))-time randomized algorithm for general input signals.   Both algorithms achieve o(n log n) time, and thus improve over the Fast Fourier Transform, for any k=o(n). They are the first known algorithms that satisfy this property. Also, if one assumes that the Fast Fourier Transform is optimal, the algorithm for the exactly k-sparse case is optimal for any k = n \u03a9(1) .   We complement our algorithmic results by showing that any algorithm for computing the sparse Fourier transform of a general signal must use at least \u03a9(k log (n/k) / log log n) signal samples, even if it is allowed to perform  adaptive  sampling.", "citation": "Citations (221)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Haitham Hassanieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassanieh:Haitham", "Piotr Indyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Indyk:Piotr", "Dina Katabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katabi:Dina", "Eric Price.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Price:Eric"], "pages": 16}
