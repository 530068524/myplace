{"title": "Coflow scheduling in input-queued switches: Optimal delay scaling and algorithms.", "fields": ["fixed priority pre emptive scheduling", "rate monotonic scheduling", "fair share scheduling", "scaling", "dynamic priority scheduling"], "abstract": "A coflow is a collection of parallel flows belonging to the same job. It has the all-or-nothing property: a coflow is not complete until the completion of all its constituent flows. In this paper, we focus on optimizing coflow-level delay, i.e., the time to complete all the flows in a coflow, in the context of an N \u00d7 N input-queued switch. In particular, we develop a throughput-optimal scheduling policy that achieves the best scaling of coflow-level delay as N \u2192 \u221e. We first derive lower bounds on the coflow-level delay that can be achieved by any scheduling policy. It is observed that these lower bounds critically depend on the variability of flow sizes. Then we analyze the coflow-level performance of some existing coflow-agnostic scheduling policies and show that none of them achieves provably optimal performance with respect to coflow-level delay. Finally, we propose the Coflow-Aware Batching (CAB) policy which achieves the optimal scaling of coflow-level delay under some mild assumptions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Qingkai Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Qingkai", "Eytan Modiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Modiano:Eytan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
