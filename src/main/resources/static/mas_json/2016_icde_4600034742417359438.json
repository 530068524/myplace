{"title": "An interval join optimized for modern hardware.", "fields": ["data structure", "theoretical computer science", "lazy evaluation", "temporal database", "order of magnitude"], "abstract": "We develop an algorithm for efficiently joining relations on interval-based attributes with overlap predicates, which, for example, are commonly found in temporal databases. Using a new data structure and a lazy evaluation technique, we are able to achieve impressive performance gains by optimizing memory accesses exploiting features of modern CPU architectures. In an experimental evaluation with real-world datasets our algorithm is able to outperform the state-of-the-art by an order of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano"], "authors": ["Danila Piatov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piatov:Danila", "Sven Helmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmer:Sven", "Anton Dign\u00f6s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dign=ouml=s:Anton"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
