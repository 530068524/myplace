{"title": "Adaptive Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers.", "fields": ["expected loss", "square", "bregman divergence", "regret", "hindsight bias"], "abstract": "The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has been studied for years. Traditional ADMM algorithms need to compute, at each iteration, an (empirical) expected loss function on all training examples, resulting in a computational complexity proportional to the number of training examples. To reduce the complexity, stochastic ADMM algorithms were proposed to replace the expected loss function with a random loss function associated with one uniformly drawn example plus a Bregman divergence term. The Bregman divergence, however, is derived from a simple 2nd-order proximal function, i.e., the half squared norm, which could be a suboptimal choice.\n\nIn this paper, we present a new family of stochastic ADMM algorithms with optimal 2nd-order proximal functions, which produce a new family of adaptive stochastic ADMM methods. We theoretically prove that the regret bounds are as good as the bounds which could be achieved by the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. Encouraging empirical results on a variety of real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Baidu", "Rutgers University", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Rutgers University", "University of Notre Dame", "Baidu", "Rutgers University", "Baidu", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Peilin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Peilin", "Jinwei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jinwei", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tong", "Ping Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Ping"], "pages": 9}
