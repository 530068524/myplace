Recently, it has been argued that using instead a more complicated, non-symmetric and higher dimensional operator, related to the non-backtracking walk on the graph, leads to improved performance in detecting clusters, and even to optimal performance for the stochastic block model. Here, we propose to use instead a simpler object, a symmetric real matrix known as the Bethe Hessian operator, or deformed Laplacian. We show that this approach combines the performances of the non-backtracking operator, thus detecting clusters all the way down to the theoretical limit in the stochastic block model, with the computational, theoretical and memory advantages of real symmetric matrices.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alaa Saade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saade:Alaa", "Florent Krzakala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krzakala:Florent", "Lenka Zdeborov\u00e1.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zdeborov=aacute=:Lenka"], "pages": 9}
