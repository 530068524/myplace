{"title": "Understanding the Role of Human Senses in Interactive Meditation.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "meditation", "anxiety", "computer science", "mindfulness"], "abstract": "In our fast-paced society, stress and anxiety have become increasingly common. Meditation for relaxation has received much attention. Meditation apps exploit various senses, e.g., touch, audio and vision, but the relationship between human senses and interactive meditation is not well understood. This paper empirically evaluates the effects of single and combined human senses on interactive meditation. We found that the effectiveness of human senses can be defined by their respective roles in maintaining the balance between relaxation and focus. This work is the first to attempt to understand these relationships. The findings have broad implications for the field of multi-modal interaction and interactive meditation applications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Kochi University of Technology", "Kochi University of Technology", "Kochi University of Technology", "Kochi University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mahmoud Mohamed Hussien Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Mahmoud_Mohamed_Hussien", "Chaklam Silpasuwanchai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silpasuwanchai:Chaklam", "Kavous Salehzadeh Niksirat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niksirat:Kavous_Salehzadeh", "Xiangshi Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiangshi"], "pages": 6}
