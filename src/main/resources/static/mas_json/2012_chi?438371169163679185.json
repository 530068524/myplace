This paper extends the IDEAS method to enable use with a design team, providing specific added support for communication and collaboration difficulties that may arise. A study to trial this extended method was conducted with two design teams, each involving three children with ASD, in a series of six, weekly design sessions focused on designing a math game. The findings from this study reveal that the children were able to successfully participate in the sessions and collaborate with other children. The findings also highlight the positive experience that involvement in such a process can offer this population.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "departments": ["University of Bath", "University of Bath", "University of Bath", "University of Bath", "University of Bath"], "authors": ["Laura Benton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benton:Laura", "Hilary Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Hilary", "Emma Ashwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ashwin:Emma", "Mark J.
