In this paper, we propose a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of urban areas from a set of uncalibrated aerial images. A very general structural prior is assumed that urban scenes consist mostly of planar surfaces oriented either in a horizontal or an arbitrary vertical orientation. In addition, most structural edges associated with such surfaces are also horizontal or vertical. These two assumptions provide powerful constraints on the underlying 3D geometry. The main contribution of this paper is to translate the two constraints on 3D structure into intra-image-column and inter-image-column constraints, respectively, and to formulate the dense reconstruction as a 2-pass Dynamic Programming problem, which is solved in complete parallel on a GPU. The result is an accurate cloud of 3D dense points of the underlying urban scene. Our algorithm completes the reconstruction of 1M points with 160 available discrete height levels in under a hundred seconds. Results on multiple datasets show that we are capable of preserving a high level of structural detail and visual quality.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Huei-Hung Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Huei=Hung", "Yuping Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Yuping", "G\u00e9rard G.
