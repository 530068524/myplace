Our goal is to improve patients' physical therapy and psychological relaxation experience through careful applications of multimedia technology. i-m-Space consists of three types of breathing-based relaxation and three types for interactive exercise-based rehabilitation.   Our inter-disciplinary team includes medical professionals, multimedia engineers, designers, and artists. We have implemented i-m-Space in an experimental space in collaboration a local breast cancer foundation. To evaluation i-m-Space, we have recruited several patients who recently recovered from breast cancer to use i-m-Space and to share their first-hand experiences. Our contributions includes the following: 1) injecting a sense of fun and playfulness into traditional therapy to attract patients; 2) providing therapists with sufficient flexibility so they can personalize therapy sessions for each patient; 3) maintaining safety of patients.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Ju-Chun Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko:Ju=Chun", "Wei-Han Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wei=Han", "Meng-Chieh Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Meng=Chieh", "Han-Hung Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Han=Hung", "Jin-Yao Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Jin=Yao", "Szu-Wei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Szu=Wei", "Yi-Yu Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Yi=Yu", "I-Ling Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:I=Ling", "Wei-Ting Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Wei=Ting", "Shih-Yao Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin_0001:Shih=Yao", "Chia-Han Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Chia=Han", "Pei-Hsuan Chou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chou:Pei=Hsuan", "King-Jen Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:King=Jen", "Mei-Lan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Mei=Lan", "Sue-Huei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Sue=Huei", "Jin-Shing Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jin=Shing", "Ming-Sui Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Ming=Sui", "Mike Y.
