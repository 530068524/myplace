{"title": "Accountability: definition and relationship to verifiability.", "fields": ["common value auction", "encryption", "secure multi party computation", "accountability", "computer science", "computer security", "knowledge management", "voting", "proof of concept"], "abstract": "Many cryptographic tasks and protocols, such as non-repudiation, contract-signing, voting, auction, identity-based encryption, and certain forms of secure multi-party computation, involve the use of (semi-)trusted parties, such as notaries and authorities. It is crucial that such parties can be held accountable in case they misbehave as this is a strong incentive for such parties to follow the protocol. Unfortunately, there does not exist a general and convincing definition of accountability that would allow to assess the level of accountability a protocol provides.   In this paper, we therefore propose a new, widely applicable definition of accountability, with interpretations both in symbolic and computational models. Our definition reveals that accountability is closely related to verifiability, for which we also propose a new definition. We prove that verifiability can be interpreted as a weak form of accountability. Our findings on verifiability are of independent interest.   As a proof of concept, we apply our definitions to the analysis of protocols for three different tasks: contract-signing, voting, and auctions. Our analysis unveils some subtleties and unexpected weaknesses, showing in one case that the protocol is unusable in practice. However, for this protocol we propose a fix to establish a reasonable level of accountability.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Trier", "University of Trier", "University of Trier"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Ralf K\u00fcsters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=uuml=sters:Ralf", "Tomasz Truderung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Truderung:Tomasz", "Andreas Vogt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogt_0001:Andreas"], "pages": 10}
