{"title": "Knowledge-Based Weak Supervision for Information Extraction of Overlapping Relations.", "fields": ["heuristic", "training set", "information extraction", "disjoint sets", "sentence"], "abstract": "Information extraction (IE) holds the promise of generating a large-scale knowledge base from the Web's natural language text. Knowledge-based weak supervision, using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multi-instance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint --- for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple).\n\nThis paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Free-base. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level.", "citation": "Citations (415)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Raphael Hoffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoffmann:Raphael", "Congle Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Congle", "Xiao Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Xiao", "Luke S.
