These chosen message attacks model a quantum adversary\u2019s ability to obtain the MAC on a superposition of messages of its choice. We begin by showing that a quantum secure PRF is sufficient for constructing a quantum secure MAC, a fact that is considerably harder to prove than its classical analogue. Next, we show that a variant of Carter-Wegman MACs can be proven to be quantum secure. Unlike the classical settings, we present an attack showing that a pair-wise independent hash family is insufficient to construct a quantum secure one-time MAC, but we prove that a four-wise independent family is sufficient for one-time security.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Mark Zhandry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhandry:Mark"], "pages": 17}
