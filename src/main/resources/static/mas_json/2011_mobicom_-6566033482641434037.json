Our mea- surements show that 3G traffic exhibits high fluctuations both in time and over space, thus incurring energy waste. In this paper, we propose a profile-based approach to green cellular infrastruc- ture. We profile BS traffic and approximate network-wide energy proportionality using non-load-adaptive BSes. The instrument is to leverage temporal-spatial traffic diversity and node deployment heterogeneity, and power off under-utilized BSes under light traf- fic. Our evaluation on four regional 3G networks shows that this simple scheme yields up to 53% energy savings in a dense large city and 23% in a sparse, mid-sized city.", "citation": "Citations (196)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Chunyi Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Chunyi", "Suk-Bok Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Suk=Bok", "Songwu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Songwu", "Haiyun Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Haiyun", "Hewu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hewu"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
