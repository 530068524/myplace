This paper targets the problem of scheduling real-time tasks with chain-based precedence constraints over multi-layer bus systems with an objective to minimize the bus cost. We show the NP-hardness of the problem and the best possible approximation ratio of approximation algorithms. A polynomial-time optimal algorithm is first proposed for a restricted case in which one multi-layer bus and unit execution and communication times are considered. The result is then extended as a pseudo-polynomial-time optimal algorithm in the considerations of multiple multi-layer buses and arbitrary execution and communication times. The capability of the proposed algorithm was evaluated to provide more insights in system designs, compared to some popular heuristics.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Center for Information Technology", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Pi-Cheng Hsiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsiu:Pi=Cheng", "Der-Nien Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Der=Nien", "Tei-Wei Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Tei=Wei"], "pages": 10}
