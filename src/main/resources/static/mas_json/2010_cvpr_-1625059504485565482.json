{"title": "Trajectory matching from unsynchronized videos.", "fields": ["sparse approximation", "trajectory", "blossom algorithm", "sparse matrix", "affine transformation"], "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of spatio-temporal matching between trajectories from two videos of the same scene. In real applications, trajectories are usually extracted independently in different videos. So possibly a lot of trajectories stay \u201calone\u201d (have no corresponding trajectory in the other video). In this paper, we propose a novel matching algorithm which can not only find the existing correspondences between trajectories, but also recover the corresponding trajectories of \u201calone\u201d ones. First, we cast trajectory matching problem as an element recovering problem from a matrix constructed by matched trajectories of the two videos, which is naturally incomplete. Then, under affine camera assumption, we recover the matrix by sparse representation and l 1  regularization techniques. Finally, the results are refined to the case of perspective projection by a local depths estimation procedure. Our algorithm can handle noisy, incomplete or outlying data. Experiments on both synthetic data and real videos show that the proposed method has good performance.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Han Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu_0001:Han", "Jie Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Jie"], "pages": 8}
