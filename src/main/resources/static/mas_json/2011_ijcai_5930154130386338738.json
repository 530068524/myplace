However, most existing studies assume the balance between negative and positive samples in both the labeled and unlabeled data, which may not be true in reality. In this paper, we investigate a more common case of semi-supervised learning for imbalanced sentiment classification. In particular, various random subspaces are dynamically generated to deal with the imbalanced class distribution problem. Evaluation across four domains shows the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Shoushan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shoushan", "Zhongqing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhongqing", "Guodong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guodong", "Sophia Yat Mei Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sophia_Yat_Mei"], "pages": 6}
