We present an ethnographic study revealing how hunters fine-tune their experience through temporal and spatial organization. The hunt is organized in a way that allows the hunters to balance between forms of collaboration ranging from solitude to face-to-face interaction, as well as between attentiveness and relaxation. Thus, the hunters deal with the task -- hunting down the prey -- while managing issues of enjoyment. We argue that understanding these experiential qualities is relevant for collaborative gaming, and adds to our understanding of leisure.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Gothenburg", "Mobile Life, In ... ockholm, Sweden"], "authors": ["Oskar Juhlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juhlin:Oskar", "Alexandra Weilenmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weilenmann:Alexandra"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
