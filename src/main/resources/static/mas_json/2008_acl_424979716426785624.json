We argue that a principle reason for this failure is not dealing with multiple, equivalent translations. We present a translation model which models derivations as a latent variable, in both training and decoding, and is fully discriminative and globally optimised. Results show that accounting for multiple derivations does indeed improve performance. Additionally, we show that regularisation is essential for maximum conditional likelihood models in order to avoid degenerate solutions.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "School of Informatics"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Phil Blunsom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blunsom:Phil", "Trevor Cohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohn:Trevor", "Miles Osborne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osborne:Miles"], "pages": 9}
