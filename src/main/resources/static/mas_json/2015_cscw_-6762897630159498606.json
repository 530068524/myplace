To address this gap, we present a set of design patterns, based on our experience designing systems with the explicit intention of increasing trust between stakeholders. We contextualize these patterns by describing our own learning process, from the development, testing and refinement of a trust model, to our realization that the insights we gained along the way were most usefully expressed through design patterns. In addition to a set of patterns for trust, this paper seeks to demonstrate of the value of patterns as a means of communicating the nuances revealed through ethnographic investigation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["Bran Knowles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knowles:Bran", "Mark Rouncefield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rouncefield:Mark", "Mike Harding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harding:Mike", "Nigel Davies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davies:Nigel", "Lynne Blair.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blair:Lynne", "James Hannon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hannon:James", "John Walden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walden:John", "Ding Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ding"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
