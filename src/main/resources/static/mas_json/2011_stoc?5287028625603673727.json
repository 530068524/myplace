The S-P-I-K-E-S protocol described in this article provides a simple, easily learned strategy for communicating bad news and suggests ways to assess the situation as it evolves and respond constructively to patients. Showing empathy, exploring the patient\u2019s understanding and acceptance of what he or she has just learned, and validating that patient\u2019s feelings can provide muchneeded support to the patient, an essential psychological intervention for managing distress and helping the patient face the treatment decisions ahead. Although breaking bad news will never be easy, having a plan of action and knowing that you can support your patient through a difficult period should help considerably.
