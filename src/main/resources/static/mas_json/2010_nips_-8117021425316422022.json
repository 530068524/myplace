Physical constraints can be exploited to restrict the space of feasible configurations. In this paper we propose an approach to constraining the prediction of a discriminative predictor. We first show that the mean prediction of a Gaussian process implicitly satisfies linear constraints if those constraints are satisfied by the training examples. We then show how, by performing a change of variables, a GP can be forced to satisfy quadratic constraints. As evidenced by the experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the tasks of rigid and non-rigid pose estimation.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "TTI, Chicago"], "authors": ["Mathieu Salzmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salzmann:Mathieu", "Raquel Urtasun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urtasun:Raquel"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
