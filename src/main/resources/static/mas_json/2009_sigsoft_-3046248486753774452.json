{"title": "Api hyperlinking via structural overlap.", "fields": ["altair", "precision and recall", "software", "computation", "hyperlink"], "abstract": "This paper presents a tool Altair that automatically generates API function cross-references, which emphasizes  reliable  structural measures and does not depend on specific client code. Altair ranks related API functions for a given query according to pair-wise overlap, i.e., how they share state, and clusters tightly related ones into meaningful modules.   Experiments against several popular C software packages show that Altair recommends related API functions for a given query with remarkably more precise and complete results than previous tools, that it can extract modules from moderate-sized software (e.g., Apache with 1000+ functions) at high precision and recall rates (e.g., both exceeding 70% for two modules in Apache), and that the computation can finish within a few seconds.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Fan Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Fan", "Xi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xi", "Yang Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai_0001:Yang"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
