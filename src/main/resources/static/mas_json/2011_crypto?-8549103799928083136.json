Our scheme is based on the assumption that the underlying n-bit blockcipher is a pseudo-random permutation. Our construction, which we call PMAC Plus, involves extensive modification to PMAC, requiring three blockcipher keys. The PMAC Plus algorithm is a first rate-1 (i.e., one blockcipher call per n-bit message block) blockcipher-based MAC secure against O(22n/3) queries, increasing the O(2n/2) security of PMAC at a low additional cost. Our analysis uses some of the security-proof techniques developed with the sum construction (Eurocrypt 2000) and with the encrypted-CBC sum construction (CT-RSA 2010).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["NTT Information ... oration, Japan"], "authors": ["Kan Yasuda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yasuda:Kan"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2011", "pages": 14}
