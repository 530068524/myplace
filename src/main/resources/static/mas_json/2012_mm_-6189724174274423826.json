However, motor learning traditionally occurs within a group setting, limiting the quality of instruction and feedback. Even during one-on-one instruction, there are impediments to feedback such as physical separation between trainer and trainee, common in many sports such as snowboarding and swimming. We propose an inexpensive solution for real-time vibrotactile positioning and speed feedback that can complement traditional motor learning, and is compatible with existing vibrotactile motor instructions. We present a psychophysical study that examined participants' initial reactions to feedback stimuli pertaining to position and speed adjustments. Results support the proposed design in terms of both usability and naturalness, and provide insight into participants' conceptualization of feedback signals and feedback for rotational movements.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Troy L.
