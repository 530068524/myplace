{"title": "A Method to Build a Geolocalized Food Price Time Series Knowledge Base Analyzable by Everyone.", "fields": ["food prices", "stakeholder", "market price", "knowledge base", "agricultural productivity"], "abstract": "Time-series analysis is a very challenging concept in Data Science for companies and industries. Harvesting prices of agricultural production (e.g. vegetable, fruit, milk...) as time series is key to operating reliable dish cost prediction at scale to ensure for example that the market price is valid. In this paper, we describe initial stakeholder needs, the service and engineering contexts in which the challenge of time-serie harvesting and management arose, and theoretical and architectural choices we made to implement a solution of historical food prices to demonstrate the feasibility. For this, we use scrappers through the TOR network. We also propose a knowledge map approach to make the data accessible to any type of users.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Blaise Pascal University"], "authors": ["Johyn Papin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papin:Johyn", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Andr\u00e8s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andr=egrave=s:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Laurent d'Orazio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/d=Orazio:Laurent"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
