It is known that the Guarded Fragment (GF) of first-order logic is decidable and satisfies some preservation properties from first-order model theory; however, it fails to have Craig interpolation. The Guarded Negation Fragment (GNF), a recently defined extension, is known to be decidable and to have Craig interpolation. Here we give the first results on effective interpolation for extensions of GF. We provide an interpolation procedure for GNF whose complexity matches the doubly exponential upper bound for satisfiability of GNF. We show that the same construction gives not only Craig interpolation, but Lyndon interpolation and relativized interpolation, which can be used to provide effective proofs of some preservation theorems. We provide upper bounds on the size of GNF interpolants for both GNF and GF input, and complement this with matching lower bounds.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Michael Benedikt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benedikt:Michael", "Balder ten Cate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cate:Balder_ten", "Michael Vanden Boom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boom:Michael_Vanden"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
