However, it is possible to restore some of these properties by making the structure of the tree visible, such as is done by visibly pushdown languages, or finite automata on trees. In this paper, we show that the structure given by such approaches remains invisible when it is read by a finite automaton (on word). In particular, we show that separability with a regular language is undecidable for visibly pushdown languages, just as it is undecidable for general context-free languages.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Eryk Kopczynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopczynski:Eryk"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 6}
