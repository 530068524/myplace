{"title": "Automated Termination Proofs for Java Programs with Cyclic Data.", "fields": ["graph", "theoretical computer science", "mathematical proof", "programming language", "java"], "abstract": "In earlier work, we developed a technique to prove termination of Java programs automatically: first, Java programs are automatically transformed to term rewrite systems (TRSs) and then, existing methods and tools are used to prove termination of the resulting TRSs. In this paper, we extend our technique in order to prove termination of algorithms on cyclic data such as cyclic lists or graphs automatically. We implemented our technique in the tool AProVE and performed extensive experiments to evaluate its practical applicability.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Marc Brockschmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brockschmidt:Marc", "Richard Musiol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Musiol:Richard", "Carsten Otto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otto:Carsten", "J\u00fcrgen Giesl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giesl:J=uuml=rgen"], "pages": 18}
