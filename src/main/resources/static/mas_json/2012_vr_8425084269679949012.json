The exercise protocol has been adopted from an evidence-based shoulder exercise program for individuals with spinal cord injury. The hardware consists of a custom metal rig that holds a standard wheelchair, six Gametraks attached to elastic exercise bands, a Microsoft Kinect, a laptop and a large screen. A total of 21 prototypes were built using drivers for Kinect, MaxMSP and Unity Pro 3 in order to evaluate game ideas based on deconstruction of the exercise protocol. Future directions include validation of our heuristic design and evaluation model and the development of an exercise suite of point-of-care VR games.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Edinburgh", "Choreo Theatro Company, Inc"], "authors": ["Marientina Gotsis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gotsis:Marientina", "Amanda Tasse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tasse:Amanda", "Maximilian Swider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swider:Maximilian", "Vangelis Lympouridis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lympouridis:Vangelis", "Irina C.
