{"title": "Probabilistic Joint Image Segmentation and Labeling.", "fields": ["partition function", "probabilistic logic", "joint probability distribution", "test set", "saddle point"], "abstract": "We present a joint image segmentation and labeling model (JSL) which, given a bag of figure-ground segment hypotheses extracted at multiple image locations and scales, constructs a joint probability distribution over both the compatible image interpretations (tilings or image segmentations) composed from those segments, and over their labeling into categories. The process of drawing samples from the joint distribution can be interpreted as first sampling tilings, modeled as maximal cliques, from a graph connecting spatially non-overlapping segments in the bag [1], followed by sampling labels for those segments, conditioned on the choice of a particular tiling. We learn the segmentation and labeling parameters jointly, based on Maximum Likelihood with a novel Incremental Saddle Point estimation procedure. The partition function over tilings and labelings is increasingly more accurately approximated by including incorrect configurations that a not-yet-competent model rates probable during learning. We show that the proposed methodology matches the current state of the art in the Stanford dataset [2], as well as in VOC2010, where 41.7% accuracy on the test set is achieved.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University of Bonn", "University of Bonn"], "authors": ["Adrian Ion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ion:Adrian", "Jo\u00e3o Carreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carreira:Jo=atilde=o", "Cristian Sminchisescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sminchisescu:Cristian"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
