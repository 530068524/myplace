We use the CODE model of Globerson et al. but constrain the embedding to lie on a high-dimensional unit sphere. This constraint allows for efficient optimization, even in the case of large datasets and high embedding dimensionality. Using k-means clustering of the embedded data, our approach efficiently produces state-of-the-art results. We analyze the reasons why the sphere constraint is beneficial in this application, and conjecture that these reasons might apply quite generally to other large-scale tasks.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Brown University", "Brown University"], "authors": ["Yariv Maron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maron:Yariv", "Michael Lamar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lamar:Michael", "Elie Bienenstock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bienenstock:Elie"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
