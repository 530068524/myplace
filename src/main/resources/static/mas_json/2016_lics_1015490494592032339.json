{"title": "Understanding Gentzen and Frege Systems for QBF.", "fields": ["proof complexity", "converse", "a normal form", "discrete mathematics", "frege system", "mathematics", "pure mathematics", "sequent calculus"], "abstract": "Recently Beyersdorff, Bonacina, and Chew [10] introduced a natural class of Frege systems for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) and showed strong lower bounds for restricted versions of these systems. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the new extended Frege system from [10], denoted EF + \u2200red, which is a natural extension of classical extended Frege EF.   Our main results are the following: Firstly, we prove that the standard Gentzen-style system G*1 p-simulates EF + \u2200red and that G*1 is strictly stronger under standard complexity-theoretic hardness assumptions.   Secondly, we show a correspondence of EF + \u2200red to bounded arithmetic: EF + \u2200red can be seen as the non-uniform propositional version of intuitionistic S12. Specifically, intuitionistic S12 proofs of arbitrary statements in prenex form translate to polynomial-size EF + \u2200red proofs, and EF + \u2200red is in a sense the weakest system with this property.   Finally, we show that unconditional lower bounds for EF + \u2200red would imply either a major breakthrough in circuit complexity or in classical proof complexity, and in fact the converse implications hold as well. Therefore, the system EF + \u2200red naturally unites the central problems from circuit and proof complexity.   Technically, our results rest on a formalised strategy extraction theorem for EF + \u2200red akin to witnessing in intuitionistic S12 and a normal form for EF + \u2200red proofs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Leeds", "University of Leeds"], "authors": ["Olaf Beyersdorff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beyersdorff:Olaf", "J\u00e1n Pich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pich:J=aacute=n"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
