Based on the assumption that a corpus follows Zipf\u2019s law, we derive tradeoff formulae of the perplexity of k-gram models and topic models with respect to the size of the reduced vocabulary. In addition, we show an approximate behavior of each formula under certain conditions. We verify the correctness of our theory on synthetic corpora and examine the gap between theory and practice on real corpora.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Yahoo!"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hayato Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Hayato"], "pages": 10}
