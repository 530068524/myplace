We address this issue by introducing the notion of coset based multiresolution analysis (CMRA) on the symmetric group, find the corresponding wavelet functions, and describe a fast wavelet transform for sparse signals. We discuss potential applications in ranking, sparse approximation, and multi-object tracking.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["Risi Kondor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kondor:Risi", "Walter Dempsey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dempsey:Walter"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
