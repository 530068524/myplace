Recently, it has been proposed that patients with unilateral spatial neglect experience sensorimotor decorrelation in the affected space. Consequently, it is possible that since the sensorimotor experience in the affected space is perturbed, patients avoid this space, which results in neglect behavior. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis using a virtual reality application built on the base of the Stringed Haptic Workbench, a large-scale visuo-haptic system. The results provide support for the hypothesis and demonstrate that the proposed application is suitable for the envisioned goal.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Inna Tsirlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsirlin:Inna", "Eve Dupierrix.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dupierrix:Eve", "Sylvie Chokron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chokron:Sylvie", "Theophile Ohlmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohlmann:Theophile", "Sabine Coquillart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coquillart:Sabine"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
