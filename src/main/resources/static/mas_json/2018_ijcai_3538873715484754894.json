Many recommender systems are based on the assumption that there exists a linear relationship between users and items while neglecting the intricacy and non-linearity of real-life historical interactions. In this paper, we propose a neural network based recommendation model (NeuRec) that untangles the complexity of user-item interactions and establishes an integrated network to combine non-linear transformation with latent factors. We further design two variants of NeuRec: user-based NeuRec and item-based NeuRec, by concentrating on different aspects of the interaction matrix. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrated their superior performances on personalized ranking task.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "Nanyang Technological University", "Griffith University", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "authors": ["Shuai Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shuai", "Lina Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Lina", "Aixin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Aixin", "Sen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Sen", "Guodong Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Guodong", "Manqing Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Manqing"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
