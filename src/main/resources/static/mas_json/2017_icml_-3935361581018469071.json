{"title": "Parallel Multiscale Autoregressive Density Estimation.", "fields": ["conditional independence", "binary logarithm", "density estimation", "inference", "speedup"], "abstract": "PixelCNN achieves state-of-the-art results in density estimation for natural images. Although training is fast, inference is costly, requiring one network evaluation per pixel; O(N) for N pixels. This can be sped up by caching activations, but still involves generating each pixel sequentially. In this work, we propose a parallelized PixelCNN that allows more efficient inference by modeling certain pixel groups as conditionally independent. Our new PixelCNN model achieves competitive density estimation and orders of magnitude speedup - O(log N) sampling instead of O(N) - enabling the practical generation of 512x512 images. We evaluate the model on class-conditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and action-conditional video generation, showing that our model achieves the best results among non-pixel-autoregressive density models that allow efficient sampling.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Ghent University", "Google", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Scott E.
