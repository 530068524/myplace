While numerous efforts have been made to encode data points into binary codes, how to calculate the effective distance on binary codes to approximate the original distance is rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose an effective distance measurement for binary code ranking. In our approach, the binary code is firstly decomposed into multiple sub codes, each of which generates a query-dependent distance lookup table. Then the distance between the query and the binary code is constructed as the aggregation of the distances from all sub codes by looking up their respective tables. The entries of the lookup tables are optimized by minimizing the misalignment between the approximate distance and the original distance. Such a scheme is applied to both the symmetric distance and the asymmetric distance. Extensive experimental results show superior performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods on three real-world high-dimensional datasets for binary code ranking.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Queensland", "National University of Singapore", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jianfeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jianfeng", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng", "Nenghai Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Nenghai", "Shipeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shipeng", "Jingdong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingdong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
