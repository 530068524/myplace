Unfortunately, existing approaches for evaluating password strength by modeling adversarial password guessing are either inaccurate or orders of magnitude too large and too slow for real-time, client-side password checking. We propose using artificial neural networks to model text passwords\u2019 resistance to guessing attacks and explore how different architectures and training methods impact neural networks\u2019 guessing effectiveness. We show that neural networks can often guess passwords more effectively than state-of-the-art approaches, such as probabilistic context-free grammars and Markov models. We also show that our neural networks can be highly compressed\u2014to as little as hundreds of kilobytes\u2014 without substantially worsening guessing effectiveness. Building on these results, we implement in JavaScript the first principled client-side model of password guessing, which analyzes a password\u2019s resistance to a guessing attack of arbitrary duration with sub-second latency. Together, our contributions enable more accurate and practical password checking than was previously possible.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Chicago", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["William Melicher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melicher:William", "Blase Ur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ur:Blase", "Sean M.
