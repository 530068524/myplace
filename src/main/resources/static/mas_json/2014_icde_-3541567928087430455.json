However, as graph data sets increasingly expand and require external storage and partitioning across a cluster of machines, more sophisticated query optimization techniques become critical to avoid explosions in query latency. In this paper, we introduce several query optimization techniques for distributed graph pattern matching. These techniques include (1) a System-R style dynamic programming-based optimization algorithm that considers both linear and bushy plans, (2) a cycle detection-based algorithm that leverages cycles to reduce intermediate result set sizes, and (3) a computation reusing technique that eliminates redundant query execution and data transfer over the network. Experimental results show that these algorithms can lead to an order of magnitude improvement in query performance.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University"], "authors": ["Jiewen Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jiewen", "Kartik Venkatraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkatraman:Kartik", "Daniel J.
