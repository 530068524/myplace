In this paper, we ask whether we can automatically synthesize MapReduce-style distributed programs from input\u2013output examples. Our ultimate goal is to enable end users to specify large-scale data analyses through the simple interface of examples. We thus present a new algorithm and tool for synthesizing programs composed of efficient data-parallel operations that can execute on cloud computing infrastructure. We evaluate our tool on a range of real-world big-data analysis tasks and general computations. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach and the small number of examples it requires to synthesize correct, scalable programs.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Calvin Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Calvin", "Aws Albarghouthi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albarghouthi:Aws"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2016", "pages": 15}
