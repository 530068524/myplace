In this work, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of deterministic leverage score sampling. We show that such sampling can be provably as accurate as its randomized counterparts, if the leverage scores follow a moderately steep power-law decay. We support this power-law assumption by providing empirical evidence that such decay laws are abundant in real-world data sets. We then demonstrate empirically the performance of deterministic leverage score sampling, which many times matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Dimitris S.
