The phenomenon applies not only to the real world, but also to multimedia data we consume every day. Whenever we look at pictures, watch a video or listen to audio recordings, our conscious attention efforts focus on the observable content, but our cognition spontaneously perceives intentions, beliefs, values, attitudes and other constructs that, while being outside of our conscious awareness, still shape our reactions and behavior. So far, multimedia technologies have neglected such a phenomenon to a large extent. This paper argues that taking into account cognitive effects is possible and it can also improve multimedia approaches. As a supporting proof-of-concept, the paper shows not only that there are visual patterns correlated with the personality traits of 300 Flickr users to a statistically significant extent, but also that the personality traits (both self-assessed and attributed by others) of those users can be inferred from the images these latter post as \"favourite\".", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["University of Verona", "University of Glasgow", "University of Verona", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Marco Cristani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cristani:Marco", "Alessandro Vinciarelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vinciarelli:Alessandro", "Cristina Segalin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segalin:Cristina", "Alessandro Perina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perina:Alessandro"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
