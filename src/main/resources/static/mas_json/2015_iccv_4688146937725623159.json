We realize that the associated feature computation is piecewise differentiable and therefore many pipelines which build on HOG can be made differentiable. This lends to advanced introspection as well as opportunities for end-to-end optimization. We present our implementation of \u0394HOG based on the auto-differentiation toolbox Chumpy [18] and show applications to pre-image visualization and pose estimation which extends the existing differentiable renderer OpenDR [19] pipeline. Both applications improve on the respective state-of-the-art HOG approaches.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Walon Wei-Chen Chiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiu:Walon_Wei=Chen", "Mario Fritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fritz:Mario"], "pages": 9}
