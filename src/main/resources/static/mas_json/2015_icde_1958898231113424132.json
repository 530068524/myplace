Our focus is customer retention within a telecommunications setting. The purpose of this demonstration is to help identify customers who should be targeted for a customer retention marketing campaign. The data analysis considers multiple factors - churn likelihood (based on incoming and outgoing communications), customer influence (based on social connections) and the average revenue per customer. The results are presented using skyline visualization and advanced UI techniques to easily and intuitively interpret the analysis.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Strategic Custo ... bane, Australia", "Strategic Custo ... bane, Australia", "Strategic Custo ... bane, Australia", "Strategic Custo ... bane, Australia", "Strategic Custo ... bane, Australia"], "authors": ["Shane Bracher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bracher:Shane", "Mark Holmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holmes:Mark", "Liam Mischewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mischewski:Liam", "Asadul K.
