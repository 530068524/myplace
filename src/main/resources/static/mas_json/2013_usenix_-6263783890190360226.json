{"title": "Efficient and Scalable Paravirtual I/O System.", "fields": ["latency", "throughput", "virtualization", "scalability", "input output"], "abstract": "The most popular I/O virtualization method today is paravirtual I/O. Its popularity stems from its reasonable performance levels while allowing the host to interpose, i.e., inspect or control, the guest's I/O activity.\n\nWe show that paravirtual I/O performance still significantly lags behind that of state-of-the-art noninterposing I/O virtualization, SRIOV. Moreover, we show that in the existing paravirtual I/O model, both latency and throughput significantly degrade with increasing number of guests. This scenario is becoming increasingly important, as the current trend of multi-core systems is towards an increasing number of guests per host.\n\nWe present an efficient and scalable virtual I/O system that provides all of the benefits of paravirtual I/O. Running host functionality on separate cores dedicated to serving multiple guest's I/O combined with a fine-grained I/O scheduling and exitless notifications our I/O virtualization system provides performance which is 1.2\u00d7-3\u00d7 better than the baseline, approaching and in some cases exceeding non-interposing I/O virtualization performance.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "IBM"], "authors": ["Nadav Har'El.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Har=El:Nadav", "Abel Gordon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gordon:Abel", "Alex Landau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Landau:Alex", "Muli Ben-Yehuda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Yehuda:Muli", "Avishay Traeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traeger:Avishay", "Razya Ladelsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ladelsky:Razya"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
