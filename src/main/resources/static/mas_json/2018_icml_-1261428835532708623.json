Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric autoencoder term that allows reliable predictors for the easy tasks to have high contribution to the feature learning while suppressing the influences of unreliable predictors for more difficult tasks. This allows the learning of less noisy representations, and enables unreliable predictors to exploit knowledge from the reliable predictors via the shared latent features. Such asymmetric knowledge transfer through shared features is also more scalable and efficient than inter-task asymmetric transfer. We validate our Deep-AMTFL model on multiple benchmark datasets for multitask learning and image classification, on which it significantly outperforms existing symmetric and asymmetric multitask learning models, by effectively preventing negative transfer in deep feature learning.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "KAIST", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Haebeom Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Haebeom", "Eunho Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Eunho", "Sung Ju Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Sung_Ju"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
