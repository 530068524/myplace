Recently, hash-based methods (e.g., locality sensitive hashing - LSH) have been shown efficient for similarity search. We extend such hash-based methods for retrieving images represented by bags of (high-dimensional) feature points. Though promising, the hash-based image object search suffers from low recall rates. To boost the hash-based search quality, we propose two novel expansion strategies -  intra-expansion  and  inter-expansion . The former expands more target feature points similar to those in the query and the latter mines those feature points that shall co-occur with the search targets but not present in the query. We further exploit variations for the proposed methods. Experimenting in two consumer-photo benchmarks, we will show that the proposed expansion methods are complementary to each other and can collaboratively contribute up to 76.3% (average) relative improvement over the original hash-based method.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Yin-Hsi Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Yin=Hsi", "Kuan-Ting Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kuan=Ting", "Chien-Hsing Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang:Chien=Hsing", "Winston H.
