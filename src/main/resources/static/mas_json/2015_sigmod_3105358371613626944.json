{"title": "From Group Recommendations to Group Formation.", "fields": ["data set", "bounded function", "voting", "recommender system", "heuristic"], "abstract": "There has been significant recent interest in the area of group recommendations, where, given groups of users of a recommender system, one wants to recommend top-$k$ items to a group that maximize the satisfaction of the group members, according to a chosen semantics of group satisfaction. Examples semantics of satisfaction of a recommended itemset to a group include the so-called least misery (LM) and aggregate voting (AV). We consider the complementary problem of how to form groups such that the users in the formed groups are most satisfied with the suggested top- k  recommendations. We assume that the recommendations will be generated according to one of the two group recommendation semantics -- LM or AV. Rather than assuming groups are given, or rely on ad hoc group formation dynamics, our framework allows a strategic approach for forming groups of users in order to maximize satisfaction. We show that the problem is NP-hard to solve optimally under both semantics. Furthermore, we develop two efficient algorithms for group formation under LM and show that they achieve bounded absolute error. We develop efficient heuristic algorithms for group formation under AV. We validate our results and demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our group formation algorithms on two large real data sets.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of British Columbia", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Senjuti Basu Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Senjuti_Basu", "Laks V.
