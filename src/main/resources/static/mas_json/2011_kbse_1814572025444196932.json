{"title": "Code-based automated program fixing.", "fields": ["program synthesis", "static program analysis", "expression", "algorithmic program debugging", "program animation"], "abstract": "Initial research in automated program fixing has generally limited itself to specific areas, such as data structure classes with carefully designed interfaces, and relied on simple approaches. To provide high-quality fix suggestions in a broad area of applicability, the present work relies on the presence of contracts in the code, and on the availability of static and dynamic analyses to gather evidence on the values taken by expressions derived from the code. The ideas have been built into the AutoFix-E2 automatic fix generator. Applications of AutoFix-E2 to general-purpose software, such as a library to manipulate documents, show that the approach provides an improvement over previous techniques, in particular purely model-based approaches.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Yu Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei_0001:Yu", "Yi Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Yi", "Carlo A.
