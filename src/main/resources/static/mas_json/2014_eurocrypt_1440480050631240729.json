{"title": "Higher Order Masking of Look-Up Tables.", "fields": ["countermeasure", "lookup table", "information retrieval", "computer science", "masking", "adversary", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We describe a new algorithm for masking look-up tables of block-ciphers at any order, as a countermeasure against side-channel attacks. Our technique is a generalization of the classical randomized table countermeasure against first-order attacks. We prove the security of our new algorithm against t-th order attacks in the usual Ishai-Sahai-Wagner model from Crypto 2003; we also improve the bound on the number of shares from n \u2265 4t + 1 to n \u2265 2t + 1 for an adversary who can adaptively move its probes between successive executions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Jean-S\u00e9bastien Coron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coron:Jean=S=eacute=bastien"], "pages": 18}
