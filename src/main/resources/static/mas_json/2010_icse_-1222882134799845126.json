{"title": "AURA: a hybrid approach to identify framework evolution.", "fields": ["software framework", "aura", "software maintenance", "software evolution", "software system"], "abstract": "Software frameworks and libraries are indispensable to today's software systems. As they evolve, it is often time-consuming for developers to keep their code up-to-date, so approaches have been proposed to facilitate this. Usually, these approaches cannot automatically identify change rules for one-replaced-by-many and many-replaced-by-one methods, and they trade off recall for higher precision using one or more experimentally-evaluated thresholds. We introduce AURA, a novel hybrid approach that combines call dependency and text similarity analyses to overcome these limitations. We implement it in a Java system and compare it on five frameworks with three previous approaches by Dagenais and Robillard, M. Kim  et al. , and Schafer  et al . The comparison shows that, on average, the recall of AURA is 53.07% higher while its precision is similar,  e.g. , 0.10% lower.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Wei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wei", "Yann-Ga\u00ebl Gu\u00e9h\u00e9neuc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu=eacute=h=eacute=neuc:Yann=Ga=euml=l", "Giuliano Antoniol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antoniol:Giuliano", "Miryung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Miryung"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
