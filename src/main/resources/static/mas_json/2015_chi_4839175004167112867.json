{"title": "The Promise of the Sharing Economy among Disadvantaged Communities.", "fields": ["disadvantaged", "sharing economy", "collective efficacy", "reciprocity", "unemployment"], "abstract": "The digital-sharing economy presents opportunities for individuals to find temporary employment, generate extra income, increase reciprocity, enhance social interaction, and access resources not otherwise attainable. Although the sharing economy is profitable, little is known about its use among the unemployed or those struggling financially. This paper describes the results of a participatory-design based workshop to investigate the perception and feasibility of finding temporary employment and sharing spare resources using sharing-economy applications. Specifically, this study included 20 individuals seeking employment in a U.S. city suffering economic decline. We identify success factors of the digital-sharing economy to these populations, identify shortcomings and propose mitigation strategies based on prior research related to trust, social capital and theories of collective efficacy. Finally, we contribute new principles that may foster collaborative consumption within this population and identify new concepts for practical employment applications among these populations.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tawanna Dillahunt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillahunt:Tawanna", "Amelia R.
