{"title": "Lattice Basis Delegation in Fixed Dimension and Shorter-Ciphertext Hierarchical IBE.", "fields": ["random oracle", "ciphertext", "encryption", "learning with errors", "delegation", "lattice", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We present a technique for delegating a short lattice basis that has the advantage of keeping the lattice dimension unchanged upon delegation. Building on this result, we construct two new hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) schemes, with and without random oracles. The resulting systems are very different from earlier lattice-based HIBEs and in some cases result in shorter ciphertexts and private keys. We prove security from classic lattice hardness assumptions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Stanford University", "University of Li\u00e8ge"], "authors": ["Shweta Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Shweta", "Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Xavier Boyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boyen:Xavier"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2010", "pages": 18}
