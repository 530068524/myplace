TrustedDB achieves this by leveraging server-hosted tamper-proof trusted hardware in critical query processing stages.   TrustedDB does not limit the query expressiveness of supported queries. And, despite the cost overhead and performance limitations of trusted hardware, the costs per query are orders of magnitude lower than any (existing or) potential future software-only mechanisms. TrustedDB is built and runs on actual hardware, and its performance and costs are evaluated here.", "citation": "Citations (152)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sumeet Bajaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bajaj:Sumeet", "Radu Sion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sion:Radu"], "pages": 12}
