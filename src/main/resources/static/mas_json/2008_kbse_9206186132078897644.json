{"title": "Towards Good Enough Testing: A Cognitive-Oriented Approach Applied to Infotainment Systems.", "fields": ["knowledge based systems", "workload", "test management approach", "unified modeling language", "software"], "abstract": "This contribution outlines a cognitive-oriented approach to construct test systems that can \"partially \" imitate several cognitive paradigms of skilled human testers. For example, learning, reasoning, optimization, etc. Hence, a reasonable portion of the workload done by a human tester would be shifted to the test system itself. This consequently leads to a substantial reduction in the development time and cost; yet the test efficiency is not sacrificed.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Dept. of Vehicl ... g, Braunschweig"], "authors": ["Asem Eltaher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eltaher:Asem"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
