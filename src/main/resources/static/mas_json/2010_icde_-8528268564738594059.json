Formal verification is not applicable, since it is based on comparing a specification with an implementation, whereas SQL queries are essentially a specification without any implementation. Thus, the standard approach for testing queries is to manually check query results on test datasets. Intuitively, a mutant is a query variant that could have been the correct query if the query was in error; a mutant is killed by a dataset if the original query and the mutant return different results on the dataset. In this paper, we address the problem of generation of test data for an SQL query, to kill mutants. Our work focuses in particular on a class of join/outer-join mutants, which are a common cause of error. To minimize human effort in testing, our techniques generate a test suite containing small and intuitive test datasets, combining them into a single dataset where possible. In the absence of foreign-key constraints, and under certain assumptions, the test suite is complete, i.e. it kills all nonequivalent mutations, in the class of join-type mutations that we consider. We also consider some common types of where-clause predicate mutants. Our techniques have been implemented in a prototype data generation tool.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "authors": ["Bhanu Pratap Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Bhanu_Pratap", "Devang Vira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vira:Devang", "S.
