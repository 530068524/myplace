In this paper, we propose the probabilistic preference planning problem for Markov decision processes, where the preferences are based on an enriched probabilistic LTL-style logic. We develop P4Solver, an SMT-based planner computing the preferred plan by reducing the problem to quadratic programming problem, which can be solved using SMT solvers such as Z3. We illustrate the framework by applying our approach on two selected case studies.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Meilun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Meilun", "Zhikun She.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/She:Zhikun", "Andrea Turrini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turrini:Andrea", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lijun"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
