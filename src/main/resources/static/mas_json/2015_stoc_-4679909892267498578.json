In particular, we show that the cut, TSP, and stable set polytopes on n-vertex graphs are not the linear image of the feasible region of any SDP (i.e., any spectrahedron) of dimension less than 2 n \u03b4  , for some constant \u03b4 > 0. This result yields the first super-polynomial lower bounds on the semidefinite extension complexity of any explicit family of polytopes.   Our results follow from a general technique for proving lower bounds on the positive semidefinite rank of a matrix. To this end, we establish a close connection between arbitrary SDPs and those arising from the sum-of-squares SDP hierarchy. For approximating maximum constraint satisfaction problems, we prove that SDPs of polynomial-size are equivalent in power to those arising from degree-O(1) sum-of-squares relaxations. This result implies, for instance, that no family of polynomial-size SDP relaxations can achieve better than a 7/8-approximation for max-sat.", "citation": "Citations (103)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of California, Berkeley", "Cornell University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["James R.
