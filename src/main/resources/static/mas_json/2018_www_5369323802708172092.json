In this game, each node aims at maximizing its degree in the future, representing its social capital in the \u201csociety\u201d formed by the nodes and their connections. This result provides additional formal support to the commonly used Preferential Attachment model, initially designed to capture the \u201crich get richer\u201d aphorism. In the process of establishing our result, we expose new connections between Preferential Attachment, random walks, and Young\u2019s Lattice.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Chen Avin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avin:Chen", "Avi Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Avi", "Pierre Fraigniaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fraigniaud:Pierre", "Zvi Lotker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lotker:Zvi", "David Peleg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peleg:David"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
