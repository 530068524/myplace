The problem of computing the edit distance between two strings is a classical computational task, with a well-known algorithm based on dynamic programming. Unfortunately, all known algorithms for this problem run in nearly quadratic time.   In this paper we provide evidence that the near-quadratic running time bounds known for the problem of computing edit distance might be {tight}. Specifically, we show that, if the edit distance can be computed in time O(n 2-\u03b4 ) for some constant \u03b4>0, then the satisfiability of conjunctive normal form formulas with N variables and M clauses can be solved in time M O(1)  2 (1-e)N  for a constant e>0. The latter result would violate the  Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis , which postulates that such algorithms do not exist.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Arturs Backurs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Backurs:Arturs", "Piotr Indyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Indyk:Piotr"], "pages": 8}
