We show that when the constraints enforced by the verifier are \u201cunique\u201d constraints (i.e., permutations), the value of the game can be well approximated by a semidefinite program (SDP). Essentially the only algorithm known previously was for the special case of binary answers, as follows from the work of Tsirelson in 1980. Among other things, our result implies that the variant of the unique games conjecture where we allow the provers to share entanglement is false. Our proof is based on a novel \u201cquantum rounding technique,\u201d showing how to take a solution to an SDP and transform it into a strategy for entangled provers. Using our approximation by an SDP, we also show a parallel repetition theorem for unique entangled games.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "bentoner@bentoner.com", "Centrum voor Wi ...
