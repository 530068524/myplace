Traditional enterprise workloads, which are typically memory and I/O bound, have been well served by chip multiprocessors com- prising of small, power-efficient cores. Recent advances in mobile computing have led to modern small cores capable of delivering even better power efficiency. While these cores can deliver performance-per-Watt efficiency for data center workloads, small cores impact application quality-of-service robustness, and flexibility, as these workloads increasingly invoke computationally intensive kernels. These challenges constitute the price of efficiency. We quantify efficiency for an industry-strength online web search engine in production at both the microarchitecture- and system-level, evaluating search on server and mobile-class architectures using Xeon and Atom processors.", "citation": "Citations (206)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Stanford University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Vijay Janapa Reddi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reddi:Vijay_Janapa", "Benjamin C.
