Unfortunately, performance of current network protocols can vary significantly because of various interferences and environmental changes. Current protocols estimate link quality based on the reception of probe packets over a short time period. This method is neither efficient nor accurate enough to capture the dramatic variations of link quality. Therefore, we propose a link metric called competence that characterizes links over a longer period of time. We combine competence with current short term estimations in routing algorithm designs. To further improve network performance we have designed a distributed route maintenance framework based on feedback control solutions. In real system evaluations with 48 T-Motes, our overall solution improves end-to-end packet delivery ratio over existing solutions by up to 40%, while reducing energy consumption by up to 22%. Importantly, our solution also achieves more stable and better transient performance than current approaches.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "College of William & Mary", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Shan Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shan", "Gang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Gang", "Kamin Whitehouse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whitehouse:Kamin", "Yafeng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yafeng", "John A.
