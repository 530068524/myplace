This paper shows how to overcome this limit. It presents interference alignment and cancellation (IAC), a new approach for decoding concurrent sender-receiver pairs in MIMO networks. IAC synthesizes two signal processing techniques, interference alignment and interference cancellation, showing that the combination applies to scenarios where neither interference alignment nor cancellation applies alone. We show analytically that IAC almost doubles the throughput of MIMO LANs. We also implement IAC in GNU-Radio, and experimentally demonstrate that for 2x2 MIMO LANs, IAC increases the average throughput by 1.5x on the downlink and 2x on the uplink.", "citation": "Citations (356)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Shyamnath Gollakota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollakota:Shyamnath", "Samuel David Perli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perli:Samuel_David", "Dina Katabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katabi:Dina"], "pages": 12}
