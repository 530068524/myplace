{"title": "Data-only flattening for nested data parallelism.", "fields": ["nesl", "simd", "task parallelism", "data parallelism", "implicit parallelism"], "abstract": "Data parallelism has proven to be an effective technique for high-level programming of a certain class of parallel applications, but it is not well suited to irregular parallel computations. Blelloch and others proposed  nested data parallelism  (NDP) as a language mechanism for programming irregular parallel applications in a declarative data-parallel style. The key to this approach is a compiler transformation that flattens the NDP computation and data structures into a form that can be executed efficiently on a wide-vector SIMD architecture. Unfortunately, this technique is ill suited to execution on today's multicore machines. We present a new technique, called  data-only flattening , for the compilation of NDP, which is suitable for multicore architectures. Data-only flattening transforms nested data structures in order to expose programs to various optimizations while leaving control structures intact. We present a formal semantics of data-only flattening in a core language with a rewriting system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in the Parallel ML implementation and we report encouraging experimental results across various benchmark applications.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "Rochester Institute of Technology", "Max Planck Society", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Lars Bergstrom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergstrom:Lars", "Matthew Fluet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fluet:Matthew", "Mike Rainey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rainey:Mike", "John H.
