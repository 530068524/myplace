{"title": "A Robust Approach to Aligning Heterogeneous Lexical Resources.", "fields": ["natural language processing", "information retrieval", "artificial intelligence", "wordnet", "similarity measure"], "abstract": "Lexical resource alignment has been an active field of research over the last decade. However, prior methods for aligning lexical resources have been either specific to a particular pair of resources, or heavily dependent on the availability of hand-crafted alignment data for the pair of resources to be aligned. Here we present a unified approach that can be applied to an arbitrary pair of lexical resources, including machine-readable dictionaries with no network structure. Our approach leverages a similarity measure that enables the structural comparison of senses across lexical resources, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the task of aligning WordNet to three different collaborative resources: Wikipedia, Wiktionary and OmegaWiki.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mohammad Taher Pilehvar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilehvar:Mohammad_Taher", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "pages": 11}
