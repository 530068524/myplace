We designed UniPass, an accessible password manager for visually impaired users based on a smart device. To evaluate UniPass, we tested and compared UniPass with two commercial password managers: LastPass, a popular password manager and StrongPass, a smart device-based password manager. Our study results of ten users, six blind and four with low vision, suggest that password managers are a promising authentication approach for visually impaired users. Participants using UniPass had the highest task completion rate and took the shortest time to complete an authentication related task. Furthermore, the majority (seven out of ten) of our participants preferred UniPass over LastPass and StrongPass.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Syracuse University", "Syracuse University", "Syracuse University"], "authors": ["Nat\u00e3 M.
