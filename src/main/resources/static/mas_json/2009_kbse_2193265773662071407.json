{"title": "Mining Hierarchical Scenario-Based Specifications.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "abstraction", "scalability", "system monitoring", "formal specification"], "abstract": "Scalability over long traces, as well as comprehensibility and expressivity of results, are major challenges for dynamic analysis approaches to specification mining. In this work we present a novel use of object hierarchies over traces of inter-object method calls, as an abstraction/refinement mechanism that enables user-guided, top-down or bottom-up mining of layered scenario-based specifications, broken down by hierarchies embedded in the system under investigation. We do this using data mining methods that provide statistically significant sound and complete results modulo user-defined thresholds, in the context of Damm and Harel\u2019s live sequence charts (LSC); a visual, modal, scenario-based, inter-object language. Thus, scalability, comprehensibility, and expressivity are all addressed. Our technical contribution includes a formal definition of hierarchical inter-object traces, and algorithms for \u2018zoomingout\u2019 and \u2018zooming-in\u2019, used to move between abstraction levels on the mined specifications. An evaluation of our approach based on several case studies shows promising results.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Sch. of Inf.
