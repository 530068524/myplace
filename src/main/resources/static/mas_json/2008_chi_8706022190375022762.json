To better support such queries, we introduce a system that automatically extracts subject-verb-object concepts from unstructured text documents and dynamically presents them to the user as navigable refinements. This approach, which we call \"idea navigation,\" makes subject-verb-object querying as simple as selecting successive refinements. It also supports exploratory search by providing a view of the most common ideas in the current result set. First-time users of a prototype system successfully used idea navigation to solve realistic search tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Tufts University", "Endeca, Cambridge, MA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Robin Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart:Robin", "Gregory Scott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scott:Gregory", "Vladimir Zelevinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zelevinsky:Vladimir"], "pages": 4}
