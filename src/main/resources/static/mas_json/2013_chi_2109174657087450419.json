{"title": "Tables in the wild: lessons learned from a large-scale multi-tabletop deployment.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "curriculum", "software deployment", "collaborative learning", "orchestration"], "abstract": "This paper presents the results and experiences of a six-week deployment of multiple digital tabletops in a school. Dillenbourg's orchestration framework was used both to guide the design and analysis of the study. Four themes, which directly relate to the design of the technology for the classroom, out of the 15 orchestration factors are considered. For each theme, we present our design choices, the relevant observations, feedback from teachers and students, and we conclude with a number of lessons learned in the form of design recommendations. The distinguishing factors of our study are its scale (in terms of duration, number of classes, subjects, and teachers), and its 'in-the-wild' character, with the entire study being conducted in a school, led by the teachers, and using teacher-prepared, curriculum-based tasks. Our primary contributions are the analysis of our observations and design recommendations for future multi-tabletop applications designed for and deployed within the classroom. Our analyses and recommendations meaningfully extend HCI's current design understandings of such settings.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Northumbria University"], "authors": ["Ahmed Kharrufa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kharrufa:Ahmed", "Madeline Balaam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balaam:Madeline", "Phil Heslop.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heslop:Phil", "David Leat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leat:David", "Paul Dolan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dolan:Paul", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
