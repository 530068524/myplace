Our approach is made of two parts. The first is a novel algorithm that effectively explores the space of possible parent sets of a node. It guides the exploration towards the most promising parent sets on the basis of an approximated score function that is computed in constant time. The second part is an improvement of an existing ordering-based algorithm for structure optimization. The new algorithm provably achieves a higher score compared to its original formulation. Our novel approach consistently outperforms the state of the art on very large data sets.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "Queen's University Belfast", "University of Lugano", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mauro Scanagatta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scanagatta:Mauro", "Cassio Polpo de Campos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Campos:Cassio_Polpo_de", "Giorgio Corani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corani:Giorgio", "Marco Zaffalon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaffalon:Marco"], "pages": 9}
