In particular, novel postulates like independence and evidence retainment have been brought forth as new standards for revising epistemic states by (sets of) propositional information. In this paper, we propose a constructive approach for revising epistemic states by sets of (propositional and conditional) beliefs that combines ideas from nonmonotonic reasoning with conditional belief revision. We also propose a novel principle called enforcement that covers both independence and evidence retainment, and we show our revision operator to comply with major postulates from the literature. Moreover, we point out the relevance of our approach for default reasoning.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technical University of Dortmund", "Technical University of Dortmund"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Gabriele Kern-Isberner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kern=Isberner:Gabriele", "Patrick Kr\u00fcmpelmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=mpelmann:Patrick"], "pages": 6}
