{"title": "Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: new ideation strategies for distributed HCI design.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "pooling", "brainstorming", "computer science", "ideation"], "abstract": "In this paper we describe the results of a design-driven study of collaborative ideation. Based on preliminary findings that identified a novel digital ideation paradigm we refer to as chainstorming, or online communication brainstorming, two exploratory studies were performed. First, we developed and tested a distributed method of ideation we call cheatstorming, in which previously generated brainstorm ideas are delivered to targeted local contexts in response to a prompt. We then performed a more rigorous case study to examine the cheatstorming method and consider its possible implementation in the context of a distributed online ideation tool. Based on observations from these studies, we conclude with the somewhat provocative suggestion that ideation need not require the generation of new ideas. Rather, we present a model of ideation suggesting that its value has less to do with the generation of novel ideas than the cultural influence exerted by unconventional ideas on the ideating team. Thus brainstorming is more than the pooling of \"invented\" ideas, it involves the sharing and interpretation of concepts in unintended and (ideally) unanticipated ways.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Haakon Faste.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faste:Haakon", "Nir Rachmel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rachmel:Nir", "Russell Essary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Essary:Russell", "Evan Sheehan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheehan:Evan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
