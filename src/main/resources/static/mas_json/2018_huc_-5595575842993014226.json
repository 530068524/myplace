{"title": "Sensing interpersonal synchrony between actors and autistic children in theatre using wrist-worn accelerometers.", "fields": ["interpersonal communication", "social skills", "autism", "accelerometer", "social engagement"], "abstract": "We introduce a method of using wrist-worn accelerometers to measure non-verbal social coordination within a group that includes autistic children. Our goal was to record and chart the children's social engagement - measured using interpersonal movement synchrony - as they took part in a theatrical workshop that was specifically designed to enhance their social skills. Interpersonal synchrony, an important factor of social engagement that is known to be impaired in autism, is calculated using a cross-wavelet similarity comparison between participants' movement data. We evaluate the feasibility of the approach over 3 live performances, each lasting 2 hours, using 6 actors and a total of 10 autistic children. We show that by visualising each child's engagement over the course of a performance, it is possible to highlight subtle moments of social coordination that might otherwise be lost when reviewing video footage alone. This is important because it points the way to a new method for people who work with autistic children to be able to monitor the development of those in their care, and to adapt their therapeutic activities accordingly.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "Goldsmiths, University of London", "University College London", "Flute Theatre, London, UK"], "authors": ["Jamie A.
