The stable states and dynamics of Boolean networks are characterized by their attractors, whose properties have been analyzed computationally, yet not much work has been done from the viewpoint of logical inference systems. In this paper, we show direct translations of Boolean networks into logic programs, and propose new methods to compute their trajectories and attractors based on inference on such logic programs. In particular, point attractors of both synchronous and asynchronous Boolean networks are characterized as supported models of logic programs so that SAT techniques can be applied to compute them. Investigation of these relationships suggests us to view Boolean networks as logic programs and vice versa.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Katsumi Inoue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inoue:Katsumi"], "pages": 7}
