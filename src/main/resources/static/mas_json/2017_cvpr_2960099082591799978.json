{"title": "Learned Contextual Feature Reweighting for Image Geo-Localization.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "annotation", "feature", "feature detection", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "We address the problem of large scale image geo-localization where the location of an image is estimated by identifying geo-tagged reference images depicting the same place. We propose a novel model for learning image representations that integrates context-aware feature reweighting in order to effectively focus on regions that positively contribute to geo-localization. In particular, we introduce a Contextual Reweighting Network (CRN) that predicts the importance of each region in the feature map based on the image context. Our model is learned end-to-end for the image geo-localization task, and requires no annotation other than image geo-tags for training. In experimental results, the proposed approach significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the standard geo-localization benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that our CRN discovers task-relevant contexts without any additional supervision.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Stevens Institute of Technology", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hyo Jin Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyo_Jin", "Enrique Dunn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunn:Enrique", "Jan-Michael Frahm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frahm:Jan=Michael"], "pages": 10}
