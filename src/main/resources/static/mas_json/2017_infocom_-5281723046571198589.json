This paper brings this feature to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wearables and smartphones, by creating a virtual \u201con-body detection sensor\u201d based on devices' inherent wireless capabilities. We investigate using the peculiar propagation characteristics of creeping waves to discern on-body wearables. To this end, we decompose signals into multiple independent components to exploit the variation features of creeping waves. We implement our system on COTS wearables and a smartphone. Extensive experiments are conducted in a lab, apartments, malls, and outdoor areas, involving 12 volunteer subjects of different age groups, to demonstrate the robustness of our system. Results show that our system can identify on-body devices at 92.3% average true positive rate and 5% average false positive rate.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0050:Wei", "Yingjie Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yingjie", "Lin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Lin", "Qian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
