We address the challenge that the information of data generation and WiFi encounters is not a priori knowledge, and propose an online decision making algorithm that takes advantage of participants' historical data. We also develop a heuristic algorithm to consume less energy and reduce the storage overhead while maintaining efficient 3G budget utilization. Experimental results from a 30-participant deployment demonstrate that, even when the budget is as small as 2.5% of a popular data plan, these two algorithms achieve higher utility of uploaded data compared to the baseline solution, especially, they increase the utility of received data by 151.4% and 137.8% for those sensitive applications.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Virginia", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Hengchang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hengchang", "Shaohan Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Shaohan", "Wei Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Wei", "Zhiheng Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Zhiheng", "Shiguang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shiguang", "Pan Hui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hui:Pan", "Tarek F.
