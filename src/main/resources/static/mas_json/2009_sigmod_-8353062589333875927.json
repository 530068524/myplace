This modern object-oriented optimizer and its optimizer framework, known as Volt, provide efficient bulk and instance level query expression representation, multiple expression managers, and rule and cost-based expression transformation organized via multiple optimizer instances. Volt has been applied to the problem of ordering very large numbers of joins by partially ordering them for subsequent optimization using standard dynamic programming. Performance analyses show the framework's utility and the optimizer's effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["ParAccel, Inc., ... ertino, CA, USA", "ParAccel, Inc., ... ertino, CA, USA", "ParAccel, Inc., ... ertino, CA, USA", "ParAccel, Inc., ... ertino, CA, USA", "ParAccel, Inc., ... ertino, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yijou Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yijou", "Richard L.
