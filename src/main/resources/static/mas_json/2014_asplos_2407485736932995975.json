Compilation scheduling determines the order in which the compilation units (e.g., functions) in a program are to be compiled or recompiled. It decides when what versions of the units are ready to run, and hence affects performance. But it has been a largely overlooked direction in JIT-related research, with some fundamental questions left open: How significant compilation scheduling is for performance, how good the scheduling schemes employed by existing runtime systems are, and whether a great potential exists for improvement. This study proves the strong NP-completeness of the problem, proposes a heuristic algorithm that yields near optimal schedules, examines the potential of two current scheduling schemes empirically, and explores the relations with JIT designs. It provides the first principled understanding to the complexity and potential of compilation scheduling, shedding some insights for JIT-based runtime system improvement.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "College of William & Mary"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Yufei Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Yufei", "Mingzhou Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Mingzhou", "Zhijia Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Zhijia", "Sarah Eisenstat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisenstat:Sarah", "Xipeng Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xipeng"], "pages": 16}
