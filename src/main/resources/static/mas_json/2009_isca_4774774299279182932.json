{"title": "Simultaneous speculative threading: a novel pipeline architecture implemented in sun's rock processor.", "fields": ["memory level parallelism", "sun microsystems", "microarchitecture", "instruction level parallelism", "register renaming"], "abstract": "This paper presents Simultaneous Speculative Threading (SST), which is a technique for creating high-performance area- and power-efficient cores for chip multiprocessors. SST hardware dynamically extracts two threads of execution from a single sequential program (one consisting of a load miss and its dependents, and the other consisting of the instructions that are independent of the load miss) and executes them in parallel. SST uses an efficient checkpointing mechanism to eliminate the need for complex and power-inefficient structures such as register renaming logic, reorder buffers, memory disambiguation buffers, and large issue windows. Simulations of certain SST implementations show 18% better per-thread performance on commercial benchmarks than larger and higher-powered out-of-order cores. Sun Microsystems' ROCK processor, which is the first processor to use SST cores, has been implemented and is scheduled to be commercially available in 2009.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "departments": ["Sun Microsystems", "Sun Microsystems", "Sun Microsystems", "Sun Microsystems", "Sun Microsystems"], "authors": ["Shailender Chaudhry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhry:Shailender", "Robert Cypher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cypher:Robert", "Magnus Ekman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ekman:Magnus", "Martin Karlsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karlsson:Martin", "Anders Landin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Landin:Anders", "Sherman Yip.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yip:Sherman", "H\u00e5kan Zeffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeffer:H=aring=kan", "Marc Tremblay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tremblay:Marc"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
