{"title": "A Symbolic Approach to Explaining Bayesian Network Classifiers.", "fields": ["odds", "bayesian network", "classifier", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We propose an approach for explaining Bayesian network classifiers, which is based on compiling such classifiers into decision functions that have a tractable and symbolic form. We introduce two types of explanations for why a classifier may have classified an instance positively or negatively and suggest algorithms for computing these explanations. The first type of explanation identifies a minimal set of the currently active features that is responsible for the current classification, while the second type of explanation identifies a minimal set of features whose current state (active or not) is sufficient for the classification. We consider in particular the compilation of Naive and Latent-Tree Bayesian network classifiers into Ordered Decision Diagrams (ODDs), providing a context for evaluating our proposal using case studies and experiments based on classifiers from the literature.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Andy Shih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shih:Andy", "Arthur Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Arthur", "Adnan Darwiche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darwiche:Adnan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
