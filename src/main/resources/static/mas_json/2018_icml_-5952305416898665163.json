{"title": "Coded Sparse Matrix Multiplication.", "fields": ["multiplication", "matrix multiplication", "computation", "intercal", "sparse matrix"], "abstract": "In a large-scale and distributed matrix multiplication problem $C=A^{\\intercal}B$, where $C\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times t}$, the coded computation plays an important role to effectively deal with \"stragglers\" (distributed computations that may get delayed due to few slow or faulty processors). However, existing coded schemes could destroy the significant sparsity that exists in large-scale machine learning problems, and could result in much higher computation overhead, i.e., $O(rt)$ decoding time. In this paper, we develop a new coded computation strategy, we call \\emph{sparse code}, which achieves near \\emph{optimal recovery threshold}, \\emph{low computation overhead}, and \\emph{linear decoding time} $O(nnz(C))$. We implement our scheme and demonstrate the advantage of the approach over both uncoded and current fastest coded strategies.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Sinong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Sinong", "Jiashang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jiashang", "Ness B.
