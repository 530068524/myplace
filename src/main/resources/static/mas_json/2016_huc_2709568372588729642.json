{"title": "Device-free detection of approach and departure behaviors using backscatter communication.", "fields": ["motion detection", "universal software radio peripheral", "software deployment", "smart environment", "backscatter"], "abstract": "Smart environments and security systems require automatic detection of human behaviors including approaching to or departing from an object. Existing human motion detection systems usually require human beings to carry special devices, which limits their applications. In this paper, we present a system called APID to detect arm reaching by analyzing backscatter communication signals from a passive RFID tag on the object. APID does not require human beings to carry any device. The idea is based on the influence of human movements to the vibration of backscattered tag signals. APID is compatible with commodity off-the-shelf devices and the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 protocol. In APID an commercial RFID reader continuously queries tags through emitting RF signals and tags simply respond with their IDs. A USRP monitor passively analyzes the communication signals and reports the approach and departure behaviors. We have implemented the APID system for both single-object and multi-object scenarios in both horizontal and vertical deployment modes. The experimental results show that APID can achieve high detection accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Han Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Han", "Chen Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian_0001:Chen", "Jinsong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jinsong", "Ge Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ge", "Zhiping Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Zhiping", "Jizhong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Jizhong", "Wei Xi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xi:Wei"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
