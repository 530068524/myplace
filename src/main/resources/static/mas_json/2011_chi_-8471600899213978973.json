{"title": "BeeParking: feedback interfaces for collective behavior change.", "fields": ["interaction design", "public good", "iterative design", "interdependence", "collective behavior"], "abstract": "Recent years have seen a growing interest for the study of feedback interfaces to support behavior change in different research areas, from personal healthcare and wellbeing, to energy saving and proenvironmental sustainability. While HCI design has been primarily inspired by behavior change models that best fit individual change, less attention has been deserved to test their validity in the context of collective behavior change, where interdependencies between people's choices and behaviors matter, as in the shared use of limited resources or public goods. We discuss some relevant directions to fill this gap, based on the iterative design of BeeParking, a feedback display aimed to induce more cooperative use of a parking facility within a work environment.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Create-Net, Trento, Italy", "Create-Net, Trento, Italy", "Create-Net, Trento, Italy", "Create-Net, Trento, Italy", "Create-Net, Trento, Italy"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Silvia Gabrielli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gabrielli:Silvia", "Alessandra Sabatino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabatino:Alessandra", "Jes\u00fas Mu\u00f1oz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mu=ntilde=oz:Jes=uacute=s", "Michele Marchesoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marchesoni:Michele", "Oscar Mayora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayora:Oscar"], "pages": 4}
