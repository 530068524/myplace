In our study, a wrist-mounted system was significantly faster to access than a device stored in the pocket or mounted on the hip. In the latter two conditions, 78% of the time it took to access the device was spent retrieving the device from its holder. As mobile devices are beginning to include peripherals (for example, Bluetooth headsets and watches connected to a mobile phone stored in the pocket), these results may help guide interface designers with respect to distributing functions across the body between peripherals.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Intel", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Ashbrook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ashbrook:Daniel", "James Clawson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clawson:James", "Kent Lyons.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyons:Kent", "Thad Starner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starner:Thad", "Nirmal J.
