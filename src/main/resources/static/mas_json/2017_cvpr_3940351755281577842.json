Our architecture combines image-based Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and surface-based Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to yield coherent segmentations of 3D shapes. The image-based FCNs are used for efficient view-based reasoning about 3D object parts. Through a special projection layer, FCN outputs are effectively aggregated across multiple views and scales, then are projected onto the 3D object surfaces. Finally, a surface-based CRF combines the projected outputs with geometric consistency cues to yield coherent segmentations. The whole architecture (multi-view FCNs and CRF) is trained end-to-end. Our approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in the currently largest segmentation benchmark (ShapeNet). Finally, we demonstrate promising segmentation results on noisy 3D shapes acquired from consumer-grade depth cameras.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Cyprus", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Evangelos Kalogerakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalogerakis:Evangelos", "Melinos Averkiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Averkiou:Melinos", "Subhransu Maji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maji:Subhransu", "Siddhartha Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Siddhartha"], "pages": 10}
