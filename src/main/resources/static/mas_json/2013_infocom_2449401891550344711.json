However, most existing research mainly focuses on the single-hop relay selection for a primary transmitter-receiver pair, which might not be able to fully explore the benefit brought by cooperative transmissions. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-hop relay selection by applying the network formation game. In order to mitigate interference and reduce delay, we propose a cooperation framework FTCO by considering the spectrum sharing in both the time and the frequency domain. Then we formulate the multi-hop relay selection problem as a network formation game, in which the multi-hop relay path is computed via performing the primary player's strategies in the form of link operations. We also devise a distributed dynamic algorithm PRADA to obtain a global-path stable network. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments and our results indicate that cooperative multi-hop relaying can significantly benefit both the primary and the secondary network, and that the network graph resulted from our PRADA algorithm can achieve the global-path stability.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["George Washington University", "George Washington University", "Beijing Jiaotong University", "Beijing Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Wei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0059:Wei", "Xiuzhen Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiuzhen", "Tao Jing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jing:Tao", "Xiaoshuang Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Xiaoshuang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
