{"title": "Joint 2D-3D temporally consistent semantic segmentation of street scenes.", "fields": ["computational geometry", "information flow", "computer graphics", "conditional random field", "image segmentation"], "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel Conditional Random Field (CRF) formulation for the semantic scene labeling problem which is able to enforce temporal consistency between consecutive video frames and take advantage of the 3D scene geometry to improve segmentation quality. The main contribution of this work lies in the novel use of a 3D scene reconstruction as a means to temporally couple the individual image segmentations, allowing information flow from 3D geometry to the 2D image space. As our results show, the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and opens a new perspective towards a tighter interplay of 2D and 3D information in the scene understanding problem.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Georgios Floros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Floros:Georgios", "Bastian Leibe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leibe:Bastian"], "pages": 8}
