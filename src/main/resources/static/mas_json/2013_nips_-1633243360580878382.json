{"title": "Lexical and Hierarchical Topic Regression.", "fields": ["ideology", "hierarchy", "politics", "latent dirichlet allocation", "regression"], "abstract": "Inspired by a two-level theory from political science that unifies agenda setting and ideological framing, we propose supervised hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (SHLDA), which jointly captures documents' multi-level topic structure and their polar response variables. Our model extends the nested Chinese restaurant processes to discover tree-structured topic hierarchies and uses both per-topic hierarchical and per-word lexical regression parameters to model response variables. SHLDA improves prediction on political affiliation and sentiment tasks in addition to providing insight into how topics under discussion are framed.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Viet-An Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Viet=An", "Jordan L.
