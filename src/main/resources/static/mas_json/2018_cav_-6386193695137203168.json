{"title": "Strix: Explicit Reactive Synthesis Strikes Back!", "fields": ["minification", "mealy machine", "parity game", "parity", "solver"], "abstract": "Strix is a new tool for reactive LTL synthesis combining a direct translation of LTL formulas into deterministic parity automata (DPA) and an efficient, multi-threaded explicit state solver for parity games. In brief, Strix (1) decomposes the given formula into simpler formulas, (2) translates these on-the-fly into DPAs based on the queries of the parity game solver, (3) composes the DPAs into a parity game, and at the same time already solves the intermediate games using strategy iteration, and (4) finally translates the winning strategy, if it exists, into a Mealy machine or an AIGER circuit with optional minimization using external tools. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability of our approach by a comparison with Party, BoSy, and ltlsynt using the syntcomp2017 benchmarks. In these experiments, our prototype can compete with BoSy and ltlsynt with only Party performing slightly better. In particular, our prototype successfully synthesizes the full and unmodified LTL specification of the AMBA protocol for \\(n=2\\) masters.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Philipp J.
