However, it has received little attention in practical applications to large problems. This paper introduces two variants of fictitious play that are implemented in behavioural strategies of an extensive-form game. The first variant is a full-width process that is realization equivalent to its normal-form counterpart and therefore inherits its convergence guarantees. However, its computational requirements are linear in time and space rather than exponential. The second variant, Fictitious Self-Play, is a machine learning framework that implements fictitious play in a sample-based fashion. Experiments in imperfect-information poker games compare our approaches and demonstrate their convergence to approximate Nash equilibria.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University College London", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Johannes Heinrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinrich:Johannes", "Marc Lanctot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lanctot:Marc", "David Silver.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silver:David"], "pages": 9}
