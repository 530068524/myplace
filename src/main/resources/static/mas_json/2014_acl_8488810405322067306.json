{"title": "Interpretable Semantic Vectors from a Joint Model of Brain- and Text- Based Meaning.", "fields": ["text corpus", "vector space", "semantics", "strengths and weaknesses", "faithful representation"], "abstract": "Vector space models (VSMs) represent word meanings as points in a high dimensional space. VSMs are typically created using a large text corpora, and so represent word semantics as observed in text. We present a new algorithm (JNNSE) that can incorporate a measure of semantics not previously used to create VSMs: brain activation data recorded while people read words. The resulting model takes advantage of the complementary strengths and weaknesses of corpus and brain activation data to give a more complete representation of semantics. Evaluations show that the model 1) matches a behavioral measure of semantics more closely, 2) can be used to predict corpus data for unseen words and 3) has predictive power that generalizes across brain imaging technologies and across subjects. We believe that the model is thus a more faithful representation of mental vocabularies.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Queen's University Belfast", "School of Elect ... omputer Science"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Alona Fyshe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fyshe:Alona", "Partha Pratim Talukdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talukdar:Partha_Pratim", "Brian Murphy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murphy:Brian", "Tom M.
