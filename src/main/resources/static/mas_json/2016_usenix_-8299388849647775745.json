{"title": "Version Traveler: Fast and Memory-Efficient Version Switching in Graph Processing Systems.", "fields": ["graph", "snapshot", "resource consumption", "compact space"], "abstract": "Multi-version graph processing, where each version corresponds to a snapshot of an evolving graph, is a common scenario in large-scale graph processing. Straightforward application of existing graph processing systems often yields suboptimal performance due to high version-switching cost. We present Version Traveler (VT), a graph processing system featuring fast and memory-efficient version switching. VT achieves fast version switching by (i) representing differences among versions as deltas and (ii) constructing the next version by integrating the in-memory graph representation of the current version with the delta(s) relating the two versions. Furthermore, VT maintains high computation performance and memory compactness. Our evaluation using multi-version processing workloads with realistic datasets shows that VT outperforms PowerGraph-- running 23x faster with a 15% memory overhead. VT is also superior to four multi-version processing systems, achieving up to 90% improvement when jointly considering processing time and resource consumption.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "IBM", "IBM", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Xiaoen Ju.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ju:Xiaoen", "Dan Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Dan", "Hani Jamjoom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamjoom:Hani", "Kang G.
