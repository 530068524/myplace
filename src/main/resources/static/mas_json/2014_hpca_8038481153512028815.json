However, the complexity, diversity, frequently changed workloads, and rapid evolution of big data systems raise great challenges in big data benchmarking. Considering the broad use of big data systems, for the sake of fairness, big data benchmarks must include diversity of data and workloads, which is the prerequisite for evaluating big data systems and architecture. Most of the state-of-the-art big data benchmarking efforts target evaluating specific types of applications or system software stacks, and hence they are not qualified for serving the purposes mentioned above.", "citation": "Citations (349)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Lei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0004:Lei", "Jianfeng Zhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhan:Jianfeng", "Chunjie Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Chunjie", "Yuqing Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yuqing", "Qiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0012:Qiang", "Yongqiang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yongqiang", "Wanling Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Wanling", "Zhen Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Zhen", "Yingjie Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Yingjie", "Shujie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shujie", "Chen Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Chen", "Gang Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Gang", "Kent Zhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhan:Kent", "Xiaona Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiaona", "Bizhu Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Bizhu"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
