Major challenges in computer-based Sumi-e simulation are to abstract complex scene information and draw smooth and natural brush strokes. To automatically generate such strokes, we propose to model a brush as a reinforcement learning agent, and learn desired brush-trajectories by maximizing the sum of rewards in the policy search framework. We also elaborate on the design of actions, states, and rewards tailored for a Sumi-e agent. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated through simulated Sumi-e experiments.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ning Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0003:Ning", "Hirotaka Hachiya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hachiya:Hirotaka", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
