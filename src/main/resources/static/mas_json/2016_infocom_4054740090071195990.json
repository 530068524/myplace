Nowadays, most of these networks have different control planes to manage routing on different layers, leading to a suboptimal use of the network resources and additional operational costs. However, some routers are able to encapsulate, decapsulate and convert protocols and act as a liaison between these layers. A unified control plane would be useful to optimize the use of the network resources and automate the routing configurations. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based architectures, such as OpenFlow, offer a chance to design such a control plane. One of the most important problems to deal with in this design is the path computation process. Classical path computation algorithms cannot resolve the problem as they do not take into account encapsulations and conversions of protocols. In this paper, we propose algorithms to solve this problem and study several cases: Path computation without bandwidth constraint, under bandwidth constraint and under other Quality of Service constraints. We study the complexity and the scalability of our algorithms and evaluate their performances on real topologies. The results show that they outperform the previous ones proposed in the literature.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "Thales Research ... hnology, France"], "authors": ["Mohamed Lamine Lamali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lamali:Mohamed_Lamine", "Nasreddine Fergani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fergani:Nasreddine", "Johanne Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Johanne", "H\u00e9lia Pouyllau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pouyllau:H=eacute=lia"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
