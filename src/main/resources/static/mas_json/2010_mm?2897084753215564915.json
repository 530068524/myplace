With this multi-layer matting scheme, objects in both foreground and background can be extracted for background substitution. The experiment shows that the proposed scheme can have a better performance in term of automatic grouping of alpha components in comparison with min-cut matte grouping.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Loughborough University", "Queen's University", "Swansea University"], "authors": ["M.
