{"title": "A Theory of QoS for Wireless.", "fields": ["feasible region", "end to end delay", "admission control", "channel reliability", "server"], "abstract": "Wireless networks are increasingly used to carry applications with QoS constraints. Two problems arise when dealing with traffic with QoS constraints. One is admission control, which consists of determining whether it is possible to fulfill the demands of a set of clients. The other is finding an optimal scheduling policy to meet the demands of all clients. In this paper, we propose a framework for jointly addressing three QoS criteria: delay, delivery ratio, and channel reliability. We analytically prove the necessary and sufficient condition for a set of clients to be feasible with respect to the above three criteria. We then establish an efficient algorithm for admission control to decide whether a set of clients is feasible. We further propose two scheduling policies and prove that they are feasibility optimal in the sense that they can meet the demands of every feasible set of clients. In addition, we show that these policies are easily implementable on the IEEE 802.11 mechanisms. We also present the results of simulation studies that appear to confirm the theoretical studies and suggest that the proposed policies outperform others tested under a variety of settings.", "citation": "Citations (205)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Tata Institute of Fundamental Research", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["I-Hong Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:I=Hong", "Vivek S.
