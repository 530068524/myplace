In this paper, we revisit both models from a unified perspective. Based on this new view, we study the properties of both models and propose new efficient training algorithms. Key to our approach is to cast parameter learning as a low-rank symmetric tensor estimation problem, which we solve by multiconvex optimization. We demonstrate our approach on regression and recommender system tasks.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Mathieu Blondel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blondel:Mathieu", "Masakazu Ishihata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishihata:Masakazu", "Akinori Fujino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujino:Akinori", "Naonori Ueda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ueda:Naonori"], "pages": 9}
