We show that for \u201cany\u201d high-order function that can be minimized in O(\u03c9), the min-max message update can be obtained using an efficient O(K(\u03c9 + log(K)) procedure, where K is the number of variables. We demonstrate how this generic procedure, in combination with efficient updates for a family of high-order constraints, enables the application of min-max propagation to efficiently approximate the NP-hard problem of makespan minimization, which seeks to distribute a set of tasks on machines, such that the worst case load is minimized.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of British Columbia", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Christopher Srinivasa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasa:Christopher", "Inmar E.
