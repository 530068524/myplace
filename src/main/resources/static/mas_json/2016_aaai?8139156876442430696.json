Unlike previous work, which has focused on inferring character roles, we focus on the problem of modeling their relationships. Rather than assuming a fixed relationship for a character pair, we hypothesize that relationships temporally evolve with the progress of the narrative, and formulate the problem of relationship modeling as a structured prediction problem. We propose a semi-supervised framework to learn relationship sequences from fully as well as partially labeled data. We present a Markovian model capable of accumulating historical beliefs about the relationship and status changes. We use a set of rich linguistic and semantically motivated features that incorporate world knowledge to investigate the textual content of narrative. We empirically demonstrate that such a framework outperforms competitive baselines.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Snigdha Chaturvedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaturvedi:Snigdha", "Shashank Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Shashank", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal", "Chris Dyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dyer:Chris"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
