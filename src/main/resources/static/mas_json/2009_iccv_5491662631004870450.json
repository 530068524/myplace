It is rooted in ideas of J. J. Gibson, and stands in contrast to traditional information as entropy or coding length of the data regardless of its use, and regardless of the nuisance factors affecting it. The non-invertibility of nuisances such as occlusion and quantization induces an \u201cinformation gap\u201d that can only be bridged by controlling the data acquisition process. Measuring visual information entails early vision operations, tailored to the structure of the nuisances so as to be \u201clossless\u201d with respect to visual decision and control tasks (as opposed to data transmission and storage tasks implicit in traditional Information Theory). I illustrate these ideas on visual exploration, whereby a \u201cShannonian Explorer\u201d guided by the entropy of the data navigates unaware of the structure of the physical space surrounding it, while a \u201cGibsonian Explorer\u201d is guided by the topology of the environment, despite measuring only images of it, without performing 3D reconstruction. The operational definition of visual information suggests desirable properties that a visual representation should possess to best accomplish vision-based decision and control tasks.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Stefano Soatto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soatto:Stefano"], "pages": 8}
