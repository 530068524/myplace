It is important to limit such overheads as processor resources become constrained and error propensity increases. The continuing decrease in SRAM cell size and the growing capacity of caches increases the likelihood of errors in SRAM arrays. To address this, redundant information can be used to correct a value after an error occurs. Information redundancy is typically provided through error-correcting codes (ECC), which append bits to every SRAM row and increase the array's area and energy consumption. We make three observations regarding error protection and utilize them in our architecture: (1) much of the data in a cache is replicated throughout the hierarchy and is inherently redundant; (2) error-detection is necessary for every cache access and is cheaper than error correction, which is very infrequent; (3) redundant information for correction need not be stored in high-cost SRAM. Our unique architecture only dedicates SRAM for error detection while the ECC bits are stored within the memory hierarchy as data. We associate a physical memory address with each cache line for ECC storage and rely on locality to minimize the impact. The cache is dynamically and transparently partitioned between data and ECC with the fraction of ECC growing with the number of dirty cache lines. We show that this has little impact on both performance (1.3% average and", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Doe Hyun Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Doe_Hyun", "Mattan Erez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erez:Mattan"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
