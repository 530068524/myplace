{"title": "SwimTrain: Exploring Exergame Design for Group Fitness Swimming.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "multimedia", "social group", "computer science"], "abstract": "We explore design opportunities for using interactive technologies to enrich group fitness exercises, such as group spinning and swimming, in which an instructor guides a workout program and members synchronously perform a shared physical activity. As a case study, we investigate group fitness swimming. The design challenge is to coordinate a large group of people by considering trade-offs between social awareness and information overload. Our resulting group fitness swimming game, SwimTrain, allows a group of people to have localized synchronous interactions over a virtual space. The game uses competitive and cooperative phases to help group members acquire group-wide awareness. The results of our user study showed that SwimTrain provides socially-enriched swimming experiences, motivates swimmers to follow a training regimen and exert more intensely, and allows strategic game play dealing with skill differences among swimmers. Consequently, we propose several practical considerations for designing group fitness exergames.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "Microsoft", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Woohyeok Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Woohyeok", "Jeungmin Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Jeungmin", "Darren Edge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edge:Darren", "Joohyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Joohyun", "Uichin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Uichin"], "pages": 13}
