This tool provides workers with augmented instructions to perform maintenance tasks more efficiently. Our prototype is a complete framework characterized by its capability to automatically generate all the necessary data from input based on untextured 3D triangle meshes, without requiring additional user intervention. An automatic offline stage extracts the basic geometric features. These are used during the online stage to compute the camera pose from a monocular image. Thus, we can handle the usual textureless 3D models used in industrial applications. A self-supplied and robust markerless tracking system that combines an edge tracker, a point based tracker and a 3D particle filter has also been designed to continuously update the camera pose. Our framework incorporates an automatic path-planning module. During the offline stage, the assembly/disassembly sequence is automatically deduced from the 3D model geometry. This information is used to generate the disassembly instructions for workers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Navarra", "University of Navarra", "University of Navarra", "University of Navarra", "University of Navarra", "University of Navarra"], "authors": ["Hugo \u00c1lvarez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Aacute=lvarez:Hugo", "Iker Aguinaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aguinaga:Iker", "Diego Borro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borro:Diego"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 1}
