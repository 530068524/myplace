Due to the robustness and real-time requirements in VR applications, most hand tracking algorithms require special device to achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use and inexpensive approach to track the hands accurately with a single normal webcam. Outstretched hand is detected by contour & curvature based detection techniques to initialize the tracking region. Robust multi-cue hand tracking is then achieved by velocity-weighted features and color cue. Experiments show that the proposed multi-cue hand tracking approach achieves continuous real-time results even for the situation of cluttered background. The approach fulfills the speed and accuracy requirements of frontal-view vision-based human computer interactions.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Zhigeng Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Zhigeng", "Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang", "Mingmin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Mingmin", "Chao Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Chao", "Kangde Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Kangde", "Xing Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xing", "Steven Zhiying Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Steven_Zhiying"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
