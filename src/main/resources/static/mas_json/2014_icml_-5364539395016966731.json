{"title": "Learning Mixtures of Linear Classifiers.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "efficiency", "subspace topology", "linear classifier", "random subspace method"], "abstract": "We consider a discriminative learning (regression) problem, whereby the regression function is a convex combination of k linear classifiers. Existing approaches are based on the EM algorithm, or similar techniques, without provable guarantees. We develop a simple method based on spectral techniques and a 'mirroring' trick, that discovers the subspace spanned by the classifiers' parameter vectors. Under a probabilistic assumption on the feature vector distribution, we prove that this approach has nearly optimal statistical efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Technicolor", "Stanford University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yuekai Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yuekai", "Stratis Ioannidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ioannidis:Stratis", "Andrea Montanari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montanari:Andrea"], "pages": 9}
