{"title": "Sense discovery via co-clustering on images and text.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "visual space", "noun phrase", "biclustering", "feature vector"], "abstract": "We present a co-clustering framework that can be used to discover multiple semantic and visual senses of a given Noun Phrase (NP). Unlike traditional clustering approaches which assume a one-to-one mapping between the clusters in the text-based feature space and the visual space, we adopt a one-to-many mapping between the two spaces. This is primarily because each semantic sense (concept) can correspond to different visual senses due to viewpoint and appearance variations. Our structure-EM style optimization not only extracts the multiple senses in both semantic and visual feature space, but also discovers the mapping between the senses. We introduce a challenging dataset (CMU Polysemy-30) for this problem consisting of 30 NPs (\u223c5600 labeled instances out of \u223c22K total instances). We have also conducted a large-scale experiment that performs sense disambiguation for \u223c2000 NPs.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Ohio State University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xinlei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xinlei", "Alan Ritter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ritter:Alan", "Abhinav Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Abhinav", "Tom M.
