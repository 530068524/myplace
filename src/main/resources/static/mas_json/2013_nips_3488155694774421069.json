Specifically, given a sample consisting of independent draws from any distribution over at most  k  distinct elements, these properties can be estimated accurately using a sample of size  O ( k  log  k ). For these estimation tasks, this performance is  optimal , to constant factors. Complementing these theoretical results, we also demonstrate that our estimators perform exceptionally well, in practice, for a variety of estimation tasks, on a variety of natural distributions, for a wide range of parameters. The key step in our approach is to first use the sample to characterize the \u201cunseen\u201d portion of the distribution\u2014effectively reconstructing this portion of the distribution as accurately as if one had a logarithmic factor larger sample. This goes beyond such tools as the Good-Turing frequency estimation scheme, which estimates the total probability mass of the unobserved portion of the distribution: We seek to estimate the  shape  of the unobserved portion of the distribution. This work can be seen as introducing a robust, general, and theoretically principled framework that, for many practical applications, essentially amplifies the sample size by a logarithmic factor; we expect that it may be fruitfully used as a component within larger machine learning and statistical analysis systems.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Paul Valiant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valiant:Paul", "Gregory Valiant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valiant:Gregory"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
