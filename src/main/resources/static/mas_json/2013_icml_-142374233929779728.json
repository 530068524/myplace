Our guarantees for both methods are expressed in terms of the original nonsmooth primal problem based on the hinge-loss.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "University of Edinburgh", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "authors": ["Martin Tak\u00e1c.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tak=aacute=c:Martin", "Avleen Singh Bijral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bijral:Avleen_Singh", "Peter Richt\u00e1rik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Richt=aacute=rik:Peter", "Nati Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nati"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
