The objective of the project is to explore and design interaction contexts in culture related public spaces such as museums, experience centres and festivals. As a perspective on this domain, I will focus on the usage of the body as an interaction device. Furthermore, the project will involve a dramaturgic take on communication and design of interactive systems in the pursuit of new ways to stage the interactive contexts.   The outcome of the project will be guidelines and conceptual frameworks which will help interaction designers when designing for bodily movement, and communicating and staging interactive content in public spaces.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Aarhus University"], "authors": ["Karen Johanne Kortbek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kortbek:Karen_Johanne"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
