The problem has attracted considerable attention within various branches of computer science, mathematics, and economics. Although, the elegant Selfridge-Conway envy-free protocol for three agents has been known since 1960, it has been a major open problem to obtain a bounded envy-free protocol for more than three agents. The problem has been termed the central open problem in cake cutting. We solve this problem by proposing a discrete and bounded envy-free protocol for four agents.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Haris Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz_0001:Haris", "Simon Mackenzie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mackenzie:Simon"], "pages": 11}
