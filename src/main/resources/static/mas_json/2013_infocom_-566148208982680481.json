For much of the film, we found it necessary to treat our oceans like we would our hero characters, and so we developed three ocean rigs that formed the basis of all our ocean variants. Using a unified workflow that our artists were already familiar with, these rigs gave them the ability to easily portray and dial in a wide variety of ocean types such as open seas, calm seas, stormy seas, lagoons, shorelines, and wide ocean vistas, some which spanned hundreds of kilometers out to the horizon. This paper describes the techniques we used and some of the challenges we faced in developing these ocean rigs.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Walt Disney Animation Studios", "Walt Disney Animation Studios", "Walt Disney Animation Studios", "Walt Disney Animation Studios", "Walt Disney Animation Studios", "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution", "University of California, San Diego", "University of Exeter", "Lincoln University", "University of Canterbury", "Australian National University", "Kingston University", "Massey University"], "authors": ["Yan Shvartzshnaider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shvartzshnaider:Yan", "Maximilian Ott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ott:Maximilian", "Olivier Mehani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehani:Olivier", "Guillaume Jourjon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jourjon:Guillaume", "Thierry Rakotoarivelo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rakotoarivelo:Thierry", "David Levy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levy:David"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
