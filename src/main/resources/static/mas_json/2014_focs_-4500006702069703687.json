While data summarization problems traditionally have been studied is the streaming model, the focus is starting to shift to distributed models, as distributed/parallel computation seems to be the only viable way to handle today's massive data sets. In this paper, we study e-approximations, a classical data summary that, intuitively speaking, preserves approximately the density of the underlying data set over a certain range space. We consider the problem of computing e-approximations for a data set which is held jointly by k players, and give general communication upper and lower bounds that hold for any range space whose discrepancy is known.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Zengfeng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zengfeng", "Ke Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Ke"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
