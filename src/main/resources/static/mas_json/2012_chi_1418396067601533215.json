The result of this process is called the \"accidentally smart home\". We developed Clipoid, an augmentable wireless technology toolkit for supporting the development of an \"accidentally smart home\" environment. We observed the real user context (static, moving) with Clipoid. We present a guideline for developing an augmentation toolkit, and identify human needs of close proximity physical interaction and multiple users-public platforms.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Jong-bum Woo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woo:Jong=bum", "Youn-Kyung Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Youn=Kyung"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
