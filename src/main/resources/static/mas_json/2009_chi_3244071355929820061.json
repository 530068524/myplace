{"title": "Non-universal usability?: a survey of how usability is understood by Chinese and Danish users.", "fields": ["usability engineering", "usability lab", "web usability", "universal usability", "pluralistic walkthrough"], "abstract": "Most research assumes that usability is understood similarly by users in different cultures, implying that the notion of usability, its aspects, and their interrelations are constant across cultures. The present study shows that this is not the case for a sample of 412 users from China and Denmark, who differ in how they understand and prioritize different aspects of usability. Chinese users appear to be more concerned with visual appearance, satisfaction, and fun than Danish users; Danish users prioritize effectiveness, efficiency, and lack of frustration higher than Chinese users. The results suggest that culture influences perceptions of usability. We discuss implications for usability research and for usability practice.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "Roskilde University", "Copenhagen Business School"], "authors": ["Olaf Frandsen-Thorlacius.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frandsen=Thorlacius:Olaf", "Kasper Hornb\u00e6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hornb=aelig=k:Kasper", "Morten Hertzum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hertzum:Morten", "Torkil Clemmensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clemmensen:Torkil"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
