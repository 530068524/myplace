As a major application task, word translation has been relying on the nearest neighbor to connect embeddings cross-lingually. However, the nearest neighbor strategy suffers from its inherently local nature and fails to cope with variations in realistic bilingual word embeddings. Furthermore, it lacks a mechanism to deal with many-to-many mappings that often show up across languages. We introduce Earth Mover's Distance to this task by providing a natural formulation that translates words in a holistic fashion, addressing the limitations of the nearest neighbor. We further extend the formulation to a new task of identifying parallel sentences, which is useful for statistical machine translation systems, thereby expanding the application realm of bilingual word embeddings. We show encouraging performance on both tasks.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Toshiba"], "authors": ["Meng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Meng", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Yang", "Huan-Bo Luan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luan:Huan=Bo", "Maosong Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Maosong", "Tatsuya Izuha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izuha:Tatsuya", "Jie Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Jie"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
