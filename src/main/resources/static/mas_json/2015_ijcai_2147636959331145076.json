{"title": "Dealing with Generic Contrariness in Structured Argumentation.", "fields": ["argumentation theory", "expressivity", "rationality", "generality", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "The adoption of a generic contrariness notion in ASPIC+ substantially enhances its expressiveness with respect to other formalisms for structured argumentation. In particular, it opens the way to novel investigation directions, like the use of multivalued logics in the construction of arguments. This paper points out however that in the current version of ASPIC+ a serious technical difficulty related with generic contrariness is present. With the aim of preserving the same level of generality, the paper provides a solution based on a novel notion of closure of the contrariness relation at the level of sets of formulas and an abstract representation of conflicts between sets of arguments. The proposed solution is shown to satisfy the same rationality postulates as ASPIC+ and represents a starting point for further technical and conceptual developments in structured argumentation.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Brescia", "University of Brescia", "University of Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Pietro Baroni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baroni:Pietro", "Massimiliano Giacomin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacomin:Massimiliano", "Beishui Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Beishui"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
