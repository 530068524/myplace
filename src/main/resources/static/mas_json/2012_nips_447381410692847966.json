{"title": "\"Provable ICA with Unknown Gaussian Noise, with Implications for Gaussian Mixtures and Autoencoders\".", "fields": ["independent component analysis", "normal distribution", "covariance", "mixture model", "gaussian noise"], "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for independent component analysis which has provable performance guarantees. In particular, suppose we are given samples of the form $$y = Ax + \\eta $$y=Ax+? where $$A$$A is an unknown but non-singular $$n \\times n$$n\u00d7n matrix, $$x$$x is a random variable whose coordinates are independent and have a fourth order moment strictly less than that of a standard Gaussian random variable and $$\\eta $$? is an $$n$$n-dimensional Gaussian random variable with unknown covariance $$\\varSigma $$\u03a3: We give an algorithm that provably recovers $$A$$A and $$\\varSigma $$\u03a3 up to an additive $$\\epsilon $$\u2208 and whose running time and sample complexity are polynomial in $$n$$n and $$1 / \\epsilon $$1/\u2208. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel \"quasi-whitening\" step that may be useful in other applications where there is additive Gaussian noise whose covariance is unknown. We also give a general framework for finding all local optima of a function (given an oracle for approximately finding just one) and this is a crucial step in our algorithm, one that has been overlooked in previous attempts, and allows us to control the accumulation of error when we find the columns of $$A$$A one by one via local search.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Yale University"], "authors": ["Sanjeev Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Sanjeev", "Rong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge_0001:Rong", "Ankur Moitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moitra:Ankur", "Sushant Sachdeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sachdeva:Sushant"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
