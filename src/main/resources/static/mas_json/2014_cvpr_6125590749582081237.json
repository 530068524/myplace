The pose estimation is formulated as a DNN-based regression problem towards body joints. We present a cascade of such DNN regres- sors which results in high precision pose estimates. The approach has the advantage of reasoning about pose in a holistic fashion and has a simple but yet powerful formula- tion which capitalizes on recent advances in Deep Learn- ing. We present a detailed empirical analysis with state-of- art or better performance on four academic benchmarks of diverse real-world images.", "citation": "Citations (841)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Google", "Google"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Alexander Toshev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toshev:Alexander", "Christian Szegedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szegedy:Christian"], "pages": 8}
