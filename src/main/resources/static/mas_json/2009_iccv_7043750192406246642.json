This is effected by generalizing the determinant form of the Ihara zeta function. We use the set of the reciprocal polynomial coefficients of the resulting Ihara zeta function, i.e. the Ihara coefficients, to construct our characterization. We also present a spectral analysis of the edge-weighted graph Ihara coefficients and indicate their advantages over graph spectral methods. Experimental results reveal that the Ihara coefficients are effective for the purpose of clustering edge-weighted graphs.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of York", "University of York", "University of York"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Peng Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren_0001:Peng", "Richard C.
