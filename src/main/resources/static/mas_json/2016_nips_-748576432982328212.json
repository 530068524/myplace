We find the minimax optimal predictions for a very general class of loss functions including all convex and many non-convex losses, extending a recent analysis of the problem for misclassification error. The result is a family of semi-supervised ensemble aggregation algorithms which are as efficient as linear learning by convex optimization, but are minimax optimal without any relaxations. Their decision rules take a form familiar in decision theory -- applying sigmoid functions to a notion of ensemble margin -- without the assumptions typically made in margin-based learning.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Necdet Serhat Aybat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aybat:Necdet_Serhat", "Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamedani:Erfan_Yazdandoost"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
