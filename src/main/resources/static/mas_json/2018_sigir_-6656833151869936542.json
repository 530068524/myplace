{"title": "Modeling Diverse Relevance Patterns in Ad-hoc Retrieval.", "fields": ["semantic matching", "machine learning", "data mining", "artificial neural network", "granularity"], "abstract": "Assessing relevance between a query and a document is challenging in ad-hoc retrieval due to its diverse patterns, i.e., a document could be relevant to a query as a whole or partially as long as it provides sufficient information for users' need. Such diverse relevance patterns require an ideal retrieval model to be able to assess relevance in the right granularity adaptively. Unfortunately, most existing retrieval models compute relevance at a single granularity, either document-wide or passage-level, or use fixed combination strategy, restricting their ability in capturing diverse relevance patterns. In this work, we propose a data-driven method to allow relevance signals at different granularities to compete with each other for final relevance assessment. Specifically, we propose a HIerarchical Neural maTching model (HiNT) which consists of two stacked components, namely local matching layer and global decision layer. The local matching layer focuses on producing a set of local relevance signals by modeling the semantic matching between a query and each passage of a document. The global decision layer accumulates local signals into different granularities and allows them to compete with each other to decide the final relevance score.Experimental results demonstrate that our HiNT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art retrieval models significantly on benchmark ad-hoc retrieval datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Yixing Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Yixing", "Jiafeng Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jiafeng", "Yanyan Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Yanyan", "Jun Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jun", "Chengxiang Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Chengxiang", "Xueqi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xueqi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
