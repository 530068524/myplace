{"title": "Negotiating for Space?: Collaborative Work Using a Wall Display with Mouse and Touch Input.", "fields": ["negotiation", "support group", "multimedia", "human computer interaction", "empirical research"], "abstract": "Wall-sized displays support group work by allowing several people to work both separately and together. However, whether people interact directly through touch input or indirectly through mouse input can have profound effects on collaboration. We present a study that compares how groups collaborate using either multitouch or multiple mice on a wall-display. Participants used both input methods to work on two tasks: a shared-goal task and a mixed-motive task. Results show differences in participants' awareness in collaborative tasks between the two input methods. The results also help understand the physical constraints touch input set on participants' control of actions in collaborative tasks. We discuss how this influences collaboration. Results also show that touch input did not promote more equal participation than mouse input. We contrast the findings to earlier research on wall-display and tabletop collaboration.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mikkel R.
