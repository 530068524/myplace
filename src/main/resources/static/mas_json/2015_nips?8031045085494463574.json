The best algorithm for the general bandit convex optimization problem guarantees a regret of O(T5/6), while the best known lower bound is \u03a9(T1/2). Many attempts have been made to bridge the huge gap between these bounds. A particularly interesting special case of this problem assumes that the loss functions are smooth. In this case, the best known algorithm guarantees a regret of O(T2/3). We present an efficient algorithm for the bandit smooth convex optimization problem that guarantees a regret of O(T5/8). Our result rules out an \u03a9(T2/3) lower bound and takes a significant step towards the resolution of this open problem.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ofer Dekel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dekel:Ofer", "Ronen Eldan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eldan:Ronen", "Tomer Koren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koren:Tomer"], "pages": 9}
