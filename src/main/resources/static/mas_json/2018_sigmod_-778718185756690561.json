Skew can be addressed by more fine-grained partitioning, at the cost of input duplication. For random load assignment, e.g., using a hash function, fine-grained partitioning creates a tradeoff between load expectation and variance. We show that minimizing load variance subject to a constraint on expectation is a monotone submodular maximization problem with Knapsack constraints, hence admitting provably near-optimal greedy solutions. In contrast to previous work on formal optimality guarantees, constant factors are not abstracted away, and we can prove this result also for more general load functions accounting for both input and output. We further demonstrate through experiments that this theoretical result leads to an effective algorithm for the problem of minimizing running time, even when load is assigned deterministically.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Rundong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Rundong", "Mirek Riedewald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riedewald:Mirek", "Xinyan Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Xinyan"], "pages": 16}
