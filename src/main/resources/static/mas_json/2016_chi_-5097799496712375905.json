{"title": "Impact of Video Summary Viewing on Episodic Memory Recall: Design Guidelines for Video Summarizations.", "fields": ["memory augmentation", "user experience design", "episodic memory", "cognitive load", "recall"], "abstract": "Reviewing lifelogging data has been proposed as a useful tool to support human memory. However, the sheer volume of data (particularly images) that can be captured by modern lifelogging systems makes the selection and presentation of material for review a challenging task. We present the results of a five-week user study involving 16 participants and over 69,000 images that explores both individual requirements for video summaries and the differences in cognitive load, user experience, memory experience, and recall experience between review using video summarisations and non-summary review techniques. Our results can be used to inform the design of future lifelogging data summarisation systems for memory augmentation.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Huy Viet Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Huy_Viet", "Sarah Clinch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clinch:Sarah", "Corina Sas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sas:Corina", "Tilman Dingler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dingler:Tilman", "Niels Henze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henze:Niels", "Nigel Davies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davies:Nigel"], "pages": 13}
