One effective method for reducing energy consumption is dynamic speed scaling, which adapts the processing speed to the current load. This paper studies how to optimally scale speed to balance mean response time and mean energy consumption under processor sharing scheduling. Both bounds and asymptotics for the optimal speed scaling scheme are provided. These results show that a simple scheme that halts when the system is idle and uses a static rate while the system is busy provides nearly the same performance as the optimal dynamic speed scaling. However, the results also highlight that dynamic speed scaling provides at least one key benefit - significantly improved robustness to bursty traffic and mis-estimation of workload parameters.", "citation": "Citations (229)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "University of Pittsburgh", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Adam Wierman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wierman:Adam", "Lachlan L.
