In this paper, we present an easy to install sensor network and an accurate but inexpensive annotation method. A recorded dataset consisting of 28 days of sensor data and its annotation is described and made available to the community. Through a number of experiments we show how the hidden Markov model and conditional random fields perform in recognizing activities. We achieve a timeslice accuracy of 95.6% and a class accuracy of 79.4%.", "citation": "Citations (743)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Tim van Kasteren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasteren:Tim_van", "Athanasios K.
