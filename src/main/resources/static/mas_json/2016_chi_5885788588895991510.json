{"title": "GaussRFID: Reinventing Physical Toys Using Magnetic RFID Development Kits.", "fields": ["interactivity", "actuator", "embedded system", "computer hardware", "grid"], "abstract": "We present GaussRFID, a hybrid RFID and magnetic-field tag sensing system that supports interactivity when embedded in retrofitted or new physical objects. The system consists of two major components - GaussTag, a magnetic-RFID tag that is combined with a magnetic unit and an RFID tag, and GaussStage, which is a tag reader that is combined with an analog Hall-sensor grid and an RFID reader. A GaussStage recognizes the ID, 3D position, and partial 3D orientation of a GaussTag near the sensing platform, and provides simple interfaces for involving physical constraints, displays and actuators in tangible interaction designs. The results of a two-day toy-hacking workshop reveal that all six groups of 31 participants successfully modified physical toys to interact with computers using the GaussRFID system.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rong-Hao Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Rong=Hao", "Han-Chih Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Han=Chih", "Bing-Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bing=Yu"], "pages": 5}
