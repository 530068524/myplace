{"title": "Why Do Cascade Sizes Follow a Power-Law?", "fields": ["cascade", "power law", "social network", "directed acyclic graph", "empirical research"], "abstract": "We introduce random directed acyclic graph and use it to model the information diffusion network. Subsequently, we analyze the cascade generation model (CGM) introduced by Leskovec et al. [19]. Until now only empirical studies of this model were done. In this paper, we present the first theoretical proof that the sizes of cascades generated by the CGM follow the power-law distribution, which is consistent with multiple empirical analysis of the large social networks. We compared the assumptions of our model with the Twitter social network and tested the goodness of approximation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Karol Wegrzycki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wegrzycki:Karol", "Piotr Sankowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankowski:Piotr", "Andrzej Pacuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pacuk:Andrzej", "Piotr Wygocki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wygocki:Piotr"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
