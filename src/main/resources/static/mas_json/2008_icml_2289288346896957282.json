Estimation of Gaussian Bayesian networks poses serious identifiability problems, which is why it was recently proposed to use non-Gaussian models. Here, we show how to combine the non-Gaussian instantaneous model with autoregressive models. We show that such a non-Gaussian model is identifiable without prior knowledge of network structure, and we propose an estimation method shown to be consistent. This approach also points out how neglecting instantaneous effects can lead to completely wrong estimates of the autoregressive coefficients.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Helsinki", "Osaka University", "University of Helsinki"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Aapo Hyv\u00e4rinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hyv=auml=rinen:Aapo", "Shohei Shimizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimizu:Shohei", "Patrik O.
