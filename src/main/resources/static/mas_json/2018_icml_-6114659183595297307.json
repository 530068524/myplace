In spite of their versatility, many DP algorithms are non-differentiable, which hampers their use as a layer in neural networks trained by back-propagation. To address this issue, we propose to smooth the max operator in the dynamic programming recursion, using a strongly convex regularizer. This allows to relax both the optimal value and solution of the original combina-torial problem, and turns a broad class of DP algorithms into differentiable operators. Theoretically , we provide a new probabilistic perspective on backpropagating through these DP operators , and relate them to inference in graphical models. We derive two particular instantiations of our framework, a smoothed Viterbi algorithm for sequence prediction and a smoothed DTW algorithm for time-series alignment. We show-case these instantiations on structured prediction (audio-to-score alignment, NER) and on structured and sparse attention for translation.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Superior National School of Advanced Techniques"], "authors": ["Arthur Mensch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mensch:Arthur", "Mathieu Blondel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blondel:Mathieu"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
