Prior to this work, tree structures were mainly designed for their pessimistic (non-speculative) accesses to have a bounded complexity. Researchers tried to evaluate transactional memory using such tree structures whose prominent example is the red-black tree library developed by Oracle Labs that is part of multiple benchmark distributions. Although well-engineered, such structures remain badly suited for speculative accesses, whose step complexity might raise dramatically with contention.   We show that our  speculation-friendly tree  outperforms the existing transaction-based version of the AVL and the red-black trees. Its key novelty stems from the  decoupling  of update operations: they are split into one transaction that modifies the abstraction state and multiple ones that restructure its tree implementation in the background. In particular, the speculation-friendly tree is shown correct, reusable and it speeds up a transaction-based travel reservation application by up to 3.5x.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "IRISA, Rennes, France", "IRISA, Rennes, France"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Tyler Crain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crain:Tyler", "Vincent Gramoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gramoli:Vincent", "Michel Raynal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raynal:Michel"], "pages": 10}
