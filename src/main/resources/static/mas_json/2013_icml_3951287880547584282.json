We devise a new algorithm that pushes the state-of-the-art forward in two ways: First, it attains a regret of O(T2/3) with respect to the best fixed policy in hindsight, whereas the previous best regret bound was O(T3/4). Second, the algorithm and its analysis are compatible with any feasible ADMDP graph topology, while all previous approaches required additional restrictions on the graph topology.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ofer Dekel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dekel:Ofer", "Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
