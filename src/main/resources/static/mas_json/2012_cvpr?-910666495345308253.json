{"title": "Fast computation of min-Hash signatures for image collections.", "fields": ["inverted index", "precision and recall", "minhash", "cluster analysis", "computation"], "abstract": "A new method for highly efficient min-Hash generation for document collections is proposed. It exploits the inverted file structure which is available in many applications based on a bag or a set of words. Fast min-Hash generation is important in applications such as image clustering where good recall and precision requires a large number of min-Hash signatures. Using the set of words represenation, the novel exact min-Hash generation algorithm achieves approximately a 50-fold speed-up on two dataset with 10 5  and 10 6  images respectively. We also propose an approximate min-Hash assignment process which reaches a more than 200-fold speed-up at the cost of missing about 2\u20133% of matches. We also experimentally show that the method generalizes to other modalities with significantly different statistics.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ondrej Chum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chum:Ondrej", "Jiri Matas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matas:Jiri"], "pages": 8}
