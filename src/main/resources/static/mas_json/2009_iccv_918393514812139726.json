{"title": "Moving in stereo: Efficient structure and motion using lines.", "fields": ["rigid body", "structure from motion", "stereopsis", "motion estimation", "overdetermined system"], "abstract": "We present a fast and robust system for estimating structure and motion using a stereo pair, with straight lines as features. Our first set of contributions are efficient algorithms to perform this estimation using a few (two or three) lines, which are well-suited for use in a hypothesize-and-test framework. Our second contribution is the design of an efficient structure from motion system that performs robustly in complex indoor environments.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Honda", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Manmohan Krishna Chandraker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandraker:Manmohan_Krishna", "Jongwoo Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Jongwoo", "David J.
