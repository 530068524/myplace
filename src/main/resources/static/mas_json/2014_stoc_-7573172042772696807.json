In particular, we prove the optimal bound of  O (\u221a n log( k )). This generalizes a result of Nazarov, who proved the analogous result in the Gaussian case, and improves upon a result of Harsha, Klivans and Meka. Furthermore, our result has implications for the runtime required to learn intersections of halfspaces.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Department of C ... 3-0404, CA, USA"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Daniel M.
