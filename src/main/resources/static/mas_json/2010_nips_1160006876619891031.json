{"title": "Agnostic Active Learning Without Constraints.", "fields": ["stability", "instance based learning", "algorithmic learning theory", "proactive learning", "online machine learning"], "abstract": "We present and analyze an agnostic active learning algorithm that works without keeping a version space. This is unlike all previous approaches where a restricted set of candidate hypotheses is maintained throughout learning, and only hypotheses from this set are ever returned. By avoiding this version space approach, our algorithm sheds the computational burden and brittleness associated with maintaining version spaces, yet still allows for substantial improvements over supervised learning for classification.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "departments": ["IBM", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Alina Beygelzimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beygelzimer:Alina", "Daniel J.
