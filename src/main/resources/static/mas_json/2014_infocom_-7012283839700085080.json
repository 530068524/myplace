{"title": "Optimal delay bound for maximum weight scheduling policy in wireless networks.", "fields": ["queue", "graph", "wireless network", "scheduling", "mathematical optimization"], "abstract": "We provide an improved bound for the expectation of the stationary delay under the maximum weight scheduling (MWS) policy in one-hop wireless networks. In the model, the interference of the links is characterized by an interference graph G =( V,E) .F or av ector\u00b5 ! R |V | (! ) ), where B is a constant depending on the arrival process. We show that the new bound is the tightest single-parameter bound obtainable with an often-used analytical framework. Generalizing the above, we also provide the tightest bounds for all MWS-w policies.
