We present a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory, which provides the necessary mathematical background and efficient numerical schemes to design fast localized convolutional filters on graphs. Importantly, the proposed technique offers the same linear computational complexity and constant learning complexity as classical CNNs, while being universal to any graph structure. Experiments on MNIST and 20NEWS demonstrate the ability of this novel deep learning system to learn local, stationary, and compositional features on graphs.", "citation": "Citations (361)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Micha\u00ebl Defferrard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Defferrard:Micha=euml=l", "Xavier Bresson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bresson:Xavier", "Pierre Vandergheynst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vandergheynst:Pierre"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
