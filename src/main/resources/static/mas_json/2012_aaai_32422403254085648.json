We show how we can collect evidence about how people optimize the parameters of an ensemble classification system using a tool that provides a visualization of misclassification costs. Then, we use these observations about human attempts to minimize cost in order to extend the performance of a state-of-the-art ensemble classification system. The study highlights opportunities for learning from evidence collected about human problem solving to refine and extend automated learning and inference.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Ashish Kapoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapoor:Ashish", "Bongshin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Bongshin", "Desney S.
