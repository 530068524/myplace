The intent is to assess the predictive power of a common conventional IMRT QA performance metric, the Gamma passing rate per beam. Methods: Ninety-six unique data sets were created by inducing four types of dose errors in 24 clinical head and neck IMRT plans, each planned with 6 MV Varian 120-leaf MLClinear accelerators using a commercial treatment planning system and step-and-shoot delivery. The error-free beams/plans were used as \u201csimulated measurements\u201d (for generating the IMRT QA dose planes and the anatomydose metrics) to compare to the corresponding data calculated by the error-induced plans. The degree of the induced errors was tuned to mimic IMRT QA passing rates that are commonly achieved using conventional methods. Results: Analysis of clinical metrics (parotid mean doses, spinal cord max and   D   1  cc    , CTV    D   95    , and larynx mean) vs IMRT QA Gamma analysis (3%/3 mm, 2/2, 1/1) showed that in all cases, there were only weak to moderate correlations (range of Pearson\u2019s   r  -values: \u22120.295 to 0.653). Moreover, the moderate correlations actually had positive Pearson\u2019s   r  -values (i.e., clinically relevant metric differences increased with increasing IMRT QA passing rate), indicating that some of the largest anatomy-based dose differences occurred in the cases of high IMRT QA passing rates, which may be called \u201cfalse negatives.\u201d The results also show numerous instances of false positives or cases where low IMRT QA passing rates do not imply large errors in anatomydose metrics. In none of the cases was there correlation consistent with high predictive power of planar IMRT passing rates, i.e., in none of the cases did high IMRT QA Gamma passing rates predict low errors in anatomydose metrics or vice versa. Conclusions: There is a lack of correlation between conventional IMRT QA performance metrics (Gamma passing rates) and dose errors in anatomic regions-of-interest. The most common acceptance criteria and published actions levels therefore have insufficient, or at least unproven, predictive power for per-patient IMRT QA.", "citation": "Citations (1,108)", "departments": ["Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Fox Chase Cancer Center", "Medical College of Wisconsin", "University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Rutgers University", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Washington State University", "University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Dublin City University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Shourya Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Shourya", "Ragunathan Mariappan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mariappan:Ragunathan", "Sandipan Dandapat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dandapat:Sandipan", "Saurabh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Saurabh", "Sainyam Galhotra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galhotra:Sainyam", "Balaji Peddamuthu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peddamuthu:Balaji"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
