Traditional transfer learning models can be inappropriate if the dependence among the outputs cannot be fully resolved by known input-specific and task-specific predictors. The proposed model treats such output responses as conditionally independent, given known predictors and appropriate unobserved  random effects . The model is nonparametric in the sense that the dimensionality of random effects is not specified  a priori  but is instead determined from data. An approach to estimating the model is presented uses an EM algorithm that is efficient on a very large scale collaborative prediction problem. The obtained prediction accuracy is competitive with state-of-the-art results.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "NEC Laboratorie ... , Cupertino, CA", "NEC Laboratorie ... , Cupertino, CA", "NEC Laboratorie ... , Cupertino, CA"], "authors": ["Kai Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Kai", "John D.
