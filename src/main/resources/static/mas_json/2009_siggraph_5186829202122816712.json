Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394 C  T   method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394 C  T   method. In addition, we present the derivation and applications of two variations of the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394 C  T   method that may be useful in the analysis of real-time, quantitative PCR data.", "citation": "Citations (88,559)", "departments": ["Applied Biosystems", "Washington State University", "University of Oslo", "Southern Methodist University", "Ohio State University", "Applied Biosystems", "University of Oxford", "McMaster University", "University of Rochester", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "Louisiana State University", "California Institute of Technology", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Calgary", "University of Duisburg-Essen", "University at Buffalo", "Professor NHS R ...
