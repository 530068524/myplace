{"title": "Align, Disambiguate and Walk: A Unified Approach for Measuring Semantic Similarity.", "fields": ["word sense", "data type", "semantic similarity", "probabilistic logic", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Semantic similarity is an essential component of many Natural Language Processing applications. However, prior methods for computing semantic similarity often operate at different levels, e.g., single words or entire documents, which requires adapting the method for each data type. We present a unified approach to semantic similarity that operates at multiple levels, all the way from comparing word senses to comparing text documents. Our method leverages a common probabilistic representation over word senses in order to compare different types of linguistic data. This unified representation shows state-ofthe-art performance on three tasks: semantic textual similarity, word similarity, and word sense coarsening.", "citation": "Citations (129)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mohammad Taher Pilehvar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilehvar:Mohammad_Taher", "David Jurgens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurgens:David", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "pages": 11}
