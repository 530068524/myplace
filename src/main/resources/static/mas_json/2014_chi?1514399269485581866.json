Much has been said previously regarding sustainability but this has largely focused on environmental rather than interpersonal relations. This paper provides an analysis of how prosocial HCI has been discussed and continues to be defined as a research field. Based on a corpus of published works, we describe a variety of genres of work relating to prosocial HCI. Key intellectual differences are explored, including the epistemological and ethical positions involved in designing for prosocial outcomes as well as how HCI researchers posit economic decision-making. Finally, emerging issues and opportunities for further debate and collaboration are discussed in turn.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["John Harvey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harvey:John", "David Golightly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golightly:David", "Andrew Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Andrew"], "pages": 10}
