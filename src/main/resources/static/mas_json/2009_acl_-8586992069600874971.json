{"title": "Semi-Supervised Active Learning for Sequence Labeling.", "fields": ["sequence labeling", "machine learning", "pattern recognition", "annotation", "active learning"], "abstract": "While Active Learning (AL) has already been shown to markedly reduce the annotation efforts for many sequence labeling tasks compared to random selection, AL remains unconcerned about the internal structure of the selected sequences (typically, sentences). We propose a semi-supervised AL approach for sequence labeling where only highly uncertain subsequences are presented to human annotators, while all others in the selected sequences are automatically labeled. For the task of entity recognition, our experiments reveal that this approach reduces annotation efforts in terms of manually labeled tokens by up to 60% compared to the standard, fully supervised AL scheme.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Jena", "University of Jena"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Katrin Tomanek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomanek:Katrin", "Udo Hahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hahn:Udo"], "pages": 9}
