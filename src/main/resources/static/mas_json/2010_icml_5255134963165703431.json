{"title": "Proximal Methods for Sparse Hierarchical Dictionary Learning.", "fields": ["operator", "sparse approximation", "k svd", "probabilistic logic", "topic model"], "abstract": "We propose to combine two approaches for modeling data admitting sparse representations: on the one hand, dictionary learning has proven effective for various signal processing tasks. On the other hand, recent work on structured sparsity provides a natural framework for modeling dependencies between dictionary elements. We thus consider a tree-structured sparse regularization to learn dictionaries embedded in a hierarchy. The involved proximal operator is computable exactly via a primal-dual method, allowing the use of accelerated gradient techniques. Experiments show that for natural image patches, learned dictionary elements organize themselves in such a hierarchical structure, leading to an improved performance for restoration tasks. When applied to text documents, our method learns hierarchies of topics, thus providing a competitive alternative to probabilistic topic models.", "citation": "Citations (361)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Rodolphe Jenatton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jenatton:Rodolphe", "Julien Mairal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mairal:Julien", "Guillaume Obozinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obozinski:Guillaume", "Francis R.
