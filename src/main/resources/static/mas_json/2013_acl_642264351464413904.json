{"title": "A Bayesian Model for Joint Unsupervised Induction of Sentiment, Aspect and Discourse Representations.", "fields": ["machine learning", "natural language processing", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "bayesian inference"], "abstract": "We propose a joint model for unsupervised induction of sentiment, aspect and discourse information and show that by incorporating a notion of latent discourse relations in the model, we improve the prediction accuracy for aspect and sentiment polarity on the sub-sentential level. We deviate from the traditional view of discourse, as we induce types of discourse relations and associated discourse cues relevant to the considered opinion analysis task; consequently, the induced discourse relations play the role of opinion and aspect shifters. The quantitative analysis that we conducted indicated that the integration of a discourse model increased the prediction accuracy results with respect to the discourse-agnostic approach and the qualitative analysis suggests that the induced representations encode a meaningful discourse structure.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Trento", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Angeliki Lazaridou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazaridou:Angeliki", "Ivan Titov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Titov:Ivan", "Caroline Sporleder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sporleder:Caroline"], "pages": 10}
