{"title": "An Optimal-Time Binarization Algorithm for Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems with Fan-Out Two.", "fields": ["rewriting", "rotation formalisms in three dimensions", "fan out", "binary form", "parsing"], "abstract": "Linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRSs) are grammar formalisms with the capability of modeling discontinuous constituents. Many applications use LCFRSs where the fan-out (a measure of the discontinuity of phrases) is not allowed to be greater than 2. We present an efficient algorithm for transforming LCFRS with fan-out at most 2 into a binary form, whenever this is possible. This results in asymptotical run-time improvement for known parsing algorithms for this class.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Padua", "Universidade da Coru\u00f1a, Spain"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Carlos G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=oacute=mez=Rodr=iacute=guez:Carlos", "Giorgio Satta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satta:Giorgio"], "pages": 9}
