We show existence of approximation algorithms (even fully polynomial time approximation schemes) as well as obtain inapproximability results.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Rochester Institute of Technology", "University of Rochester", "Rochester Institute of Technology", "Rochester Institute of Technology", "Rochester Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Eric Brelsford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brelsford:Eric", "Piotr Faliszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faliszewski:Piotr", "Edith Hemaspaandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hemaspaandra:Edith", "Henning Schnoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schnoor:Henning", "Ilka Schnoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schnoor:Ilka"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
