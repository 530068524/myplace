{"title": "Adaptive Stochastic Optimization: From Sets to Paths.", "fields": ["recursion", "version space", "pointwise", "marginal likelihood", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "Adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) optimizes an objective function adaptively under uncertainty. It plays a crucial role in planning and learning under uncertainty, but is, unfortunately, computationally intractable in general. This paper introduces two conditions on the objective function, the marginal likelihood rate bound and the marginal likelihood bound, which, together with pointwise submodularity, enable efficient approximate solution of ASO. Several interesting classes of functions satisfy these conditions naturally, e.g., the version space reduction function for hypothesis learning. We describe Recursive Adaptive Coverage, a new ASO algorithm that exploits these conditions, and apply the algorithm to two robot planning tasks under uncertainty. In contrast to the earlier submodular optimization approach, our algorithm applies to ASO over both sets and paths.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zhan Wei Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Zhan_Wei", "David Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:David", "Wee Sun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wee_Sun"], "pages": 9}
