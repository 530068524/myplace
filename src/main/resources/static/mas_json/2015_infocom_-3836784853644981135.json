This is especially true for applications that have time sensitive constraints such as streaming services. We explore the benefits of a coded generalization of selective repeat ARQ for minimizing the in-order delivery delay. An analysis of the delay's first two moments is provided so that we can determine when and how much redundancy should be added to meet a user's requirements. Numerical results help show the gains over selective repeat ARQ, as well as the trade-offs between meeting the user's delay constraints and the costs inflicted on the achievable rate. Finally, the analysis is compared with experimental results to help illustrate how our work can be used to help inform system decisions.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Trinity College", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jason Cloud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cloud:Jason", "Douglas J.
