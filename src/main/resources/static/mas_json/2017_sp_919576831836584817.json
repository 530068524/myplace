But OPE and ORE ciphertexts necessarily leak information about plaintexts, and what level of security they provide in practice has been unclear. In this work, we introduce new leakage-abuse attacks that recover plaintexts from OPE/ORE-encrypted databases. Underlying our new attacks is a framework in which we cast the adversary's challenge as a non-crossing bipartite matching problem. This allows easy tailoring of attacks to a specific scheme's leakage profile. In a case study of customer records, we show attacks that recover 99% of first names, 97% of last names, and 90% of birthdates held in a database, despite all values being encrypted with the OPE scheme most widely used in practice. We also show the first attack against the recent frequency-hiding Kerschbaum scheme, to which no prior attacks have been demonstrated. Our attack recovers frequently occurring plaintexts most of the time.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Southern California", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Paul Grubbs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grubbs:Paul", "Kevin Sekniqi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sekniqi:Kevin", "Vincent Bindschaedler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bindschaedler:Vincent", "Muhammad Naveed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naveed_0001:Muhammad", "Thomas Ristenpart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ristenpart:Thomas"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2017", "pages": 18}
