Our formulation deals with incomplete information, preferences, and changing goals. We assume that each agent is equipped with a knowledge base for negotiation which consists of a CR-program, a set of possible assumptions, and a set of ordered goals. We use the notion of an answer set as a means to formalize the basic notions of negotiation such as proposal, response, negotiation, negotiation tree (protocol), etc. and discuss their properties.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["New Mexico State University", "Wakayama University"], "authors": ["Tran Cao Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Tran_Cao", "Chiaki Sakama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakama:Chiaki"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
