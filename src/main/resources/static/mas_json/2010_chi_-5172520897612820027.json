{"title": "The implications of improvisational acting and role-playing on design methodologies.", "fields": ["engineering design process", "design methods", "entertainment", "design process", "improvisation"], "abstract": "For decades designers have used theatre metaphors to describe design methodologies and have used performance techniques to enhance the design process, two of which are improvisational acting and role-playing. Unfortunately, most design literature does not differentiate between these two practices even while using them in combination with various design methods. This paper discusses how improvisation and role-playing have been employed during the design process and why they are distinct from one another. The authors draw upon their current research involving improvisational acting and compare it with other role-playing research which examines role-playing from both a serious and entertainment angle. They conclude through this comparison that both performance techniques have their place in the design process and that more informed definitions of each technique can aid designers in deciding which technique's properties will benefit them the most.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ben Medler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medler:Ben", "Brian Magerko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magerko:Brian"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
