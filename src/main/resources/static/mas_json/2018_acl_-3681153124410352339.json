It treats all sentences that do not match the ground truth as equally poor, ignoring the structure of the output space. Second, it suffers from \"exposure bias\": during training tokens are predicted given ground-truth sequences, while at test time prediction is conditioned on generated output sequences. To overcome these limitations we build upon the recent reward augmented maximum likelihood approach i.e. sequence-level smoothing that encourages the model to predict sentences close to the ground truth according to a given performance metric. We extend this approach to token-level loss smoothing, and propose improvements to the sequence-level smoothing approach. Our experiments on two different tasks, image captioning and machine translation, show that token-level and sequence-level loss smoothing are complementary, and significantly improve results.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Grenoble", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Laurent Besacier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Besacier:Laurent", "Maha Elbayad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elbayad:Maha", "Jakob Verbeek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verbeek:Jakob"], "pages": 10}
