A cadaster is an official register that records land properties (e.g., location, ownership, value and size) for land valuation and taxation. Such mapping of old and new cadasters can help historians understand the social/economic background of changes in land uses or ownership. With JigsawMap, historians can continue mapping older or newer cadasters. In this way, JigsawMap can connect the past land survey results to today and to the future. We conducted usability studies and long term case studies to evaluate JigsawMap, and received positive responses. As well as summarizing the evaluation results, we also present design guidelines for participatory design projects with historians.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Samsung Techwin", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Hyungmin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hyungmin", "Sooyun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sooyun", "Namwook Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Namwook", "Jinwook Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Jinwook"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
