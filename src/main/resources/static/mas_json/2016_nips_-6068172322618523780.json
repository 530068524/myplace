{"title": "DeepMath - Deep Sequence Models for Premise Selection.", "fields": ["deep learning", "bottleneck", "mizar system", "premise", "automated theorem proving"], "abstract": "We study the effectiveness of neural sequence models for premise selection in automated theorem proving, a key bottleneck for progress in formalized mathematics. We propose a two stage approach for this task that yields good results for the premise selection task on the Mizar corpus while avoiding the hand-engineered features of existing state-of-the-art models. To our knowledge, this is the first time deep learning has been applied theorem proving on a large scale.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "authors": ["Geoffrey Irving.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irving:Geoffrey", "Christian Szegedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szegedy:Christian", "Alexander A.
