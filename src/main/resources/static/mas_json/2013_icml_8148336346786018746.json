Based on a recently proposed framework so-called safe screening rule, we derive a rule for screening out non-SVs in advance, and discuss how we can exploit the advantage of the rule in pathwise SVM computation scenario. Experiments indicate that our approach often substantially reduce the total pathwise computation cost.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kohei Ogawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogawa:Kohei", "Yoshiki Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Yoshiki", "Ichiro Takeuchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takeuchi:Ichiro"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
