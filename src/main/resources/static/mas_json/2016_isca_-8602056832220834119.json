{"title": "Decoupling Loads for Nano-Instruction Set Computers.", "fields": ["data access", "instruction set", "reduced instruction set computing", "nano", "instruction register"], "abstract": "We propose an ISA extension that decouples the data access and register write operations in a load instruction. We describe system and hardware support for decoupled loads. Furthermore, we show how compilers can generate better static instruction schedules by hoisting a decoupled load's data access above may-alias stores and branches. We find that decoupled loads improve performance with geometric mean speedups of 8.4%.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Ziqiang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ziqiang", "Andrew D.
