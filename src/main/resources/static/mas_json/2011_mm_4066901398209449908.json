In order to exploit spatio-temporal correlation present in the video for key frame extraction, we propose a bi-layer group sparse representation in which the input video frames are first segmented into homogeneous patches and group sparsity is imposed at two levels simultaneously: (i) patch-to-frame, and (ii) frame-to-sequence. The grouped sparse coefficients are further combined with frame quality scores to generate key frames. Extensive experiments are performed on videos from actual end users. Results obtained by the proposed approach compare favorably with existing methods to confirm its effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Eastman Kodak Company", "Eastman Kodak Company", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Zheshen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zheshen", "Mrityunjay Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Mrityunjay", "Jiebo Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jiebo", "Baoxin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baoxin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
