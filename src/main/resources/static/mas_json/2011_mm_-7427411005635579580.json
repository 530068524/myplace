{"title": "A C++ library for handling MPEG-7 descriptions.", "fields": ["xpath", "serialization", "extensibility", "license", "mac os"], "abstract": "We present a C++ library implementing part 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the MPEG 7 multimedia content description standard, including the updated version finalized in 2004. The library supports handling of MPEG-7 descriptions as trees of typed objects, supporting (de)serialization from/to XML. It has convenient and powerful features such as creation of subtrees by XPath statements and is extensible at runtime. The library is available for Windows, Linux/Unix and Mac OS X. It has been provided under a free use license for several years, downloaded more than 5,200 times and used in a large number of projects. It has been published under GNU LGPL in 2009. This paper discusses the key functionalities of the library as well as some exemplary applications.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Joanneum Research", "Joanneum Research", "Joanneum Research", "Joanneum Research", "Joanneum Research"], "authors": ["Werner Bailer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailer:Werner", "Hermann F\u00fcrntratt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/F=uuml=rntratt:Hermann", "Peter Schallauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schallauer:Peter", "Georg Thallinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thallinger:Georg", "Werner Haas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haas_0001:Werner"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
