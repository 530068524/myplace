In particular, a variety of tools that perform GO enrichment analysis are currently available. Most of these tools require as input a target set of genes and a background set and seek enrichment in the target set compared to the background set. A few tools also exist that support analyzing ranked lists. The latter typically rely on simulations or on union-bound correction for assigning statistical significance to the results.", "citation": "Citations (1,578)", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Tel Aviv University", "Agilent Technologies", "Agilent Technologies", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Agilent Technologies", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute", "University of Montpellier", "University of Washington", "Aarhus University", "Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement", "World Health Organization", "Wildlife Conservation Society", "University of Alabama at Birmingham", "University of Alabama at Birmingham", "University of Alabama at Birmingham", "University of Alabama at Birmingham", "University of Alabama at Birmingham", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "Johns Hopkins University", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "Centre Internat ... ceville, Gabon.", "Centre Internat ... ceville, Gabon.", "Henry M Jackson ... kville, MD, USA"], "authors": ["Coke Ferreiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreiro:Coke"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
