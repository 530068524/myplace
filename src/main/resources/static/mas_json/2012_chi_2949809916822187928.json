However, there are few systematic studies of enhancing spatial ability with mobile devices, and applications such as turn-by-turn navigation systems have even been associated with a decline in spatial skills. In this paper we present a study based on the 1971 Shepard-Metzler mental rotation test but performed on a mobile-phone handset and a tablet PC. Our study extends the original experiment with the incorporation of touch and tilt interaction techniques, in order to determine if these affect the use and acquisition of spatial skills. Results suggest that the task is performed faster, and with no significant difference in accuracy, when participants rely on mental abilities rather than interaction techniques to perform 3D rotations. We also find significant differences between tablet and phone handset platforms under interactive conditions. We conclude that applications on mobile devices could be designed to enhance rather than erode spatial skills, by supporting the use of imagination to align real and virtual content.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bath", "University of Bristol"], "authors": ["Douglas Boari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boari:Douglas", "Mike Fraser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fraser:Mike", "Danae Stanton Fraser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fraser:Danae_Stanton", "Kirsten Cater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cater:Kirsten"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
