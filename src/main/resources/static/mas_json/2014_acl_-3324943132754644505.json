A tensorspace model represents data in a compact way, and via rank-1 approximation the weight tensor can be made highly structured, resulting in a significantly smaller number of free parameters to be estimated than in comparable vector-space models. This regularizes the model complexity and makes the tensor model highly effective in situations where a large feature set is defined but very limited resources are available for training. We apply with the proposed algorithm to a parsing task, and show that even with very little training data the learning algorithm based on a tensor model performs well, and gives significantly better results than standard learning algorithms based on traditional vectorspace models.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yuan Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yuan", "Sanjeev Khudanpur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khudanpur:Sanjeev"], "pages": 10}
