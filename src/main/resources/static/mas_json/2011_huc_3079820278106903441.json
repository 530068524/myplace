In this paper we detect flawed urban planning using the GPS trajectories of taxicabs traveling in urban areas. The detected results consist of 1) pairs of regions with salient traffic problems and 2) the linking structure as well as correlation among them. These results can evaluate the effectiveness of the carried out planning, such as a newly built road and subway lines in a city, and remind city planners of a problem that has not been recognized when they conceive future plans. We conduct our method using the trajectories generated by 30,000 taxis from March to May in 2009 and 2010 in Beijing, and evaluate our results with the real urban planning of Beijing.", "citation": "Citations (414)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Science and Technology Beijing", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0004:Yu", "Yanchi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yanchi", "Jing Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Jing", "Xing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Xing"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
