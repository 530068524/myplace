While there is a simple combinatorial 1/4-approximation algorithm, the best hardness result remains at 1/2 assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). We show that it is NP-hard to approximate within a factor better than 1/4 under the UGC, so that the simple combinatorial algorithm might be the best possible. We also prove that for any e > 0, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that the integrality gap of n \u03b4 -rounds of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of linear programming for Graph Pricing is at most 1/4 + e. This work is based on the effort to view the Graph Pricing problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) simpler than the standard and complicated formulation. We propose the problem called Generalized Max-Dicut(T), which has a domain size T + 1 for every T \u2265 1. Generalized Max-Dicut(1) is well-known Max-Dicut. There is an approximation preserving reduction from Generalized Max-Dicut on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to Graph Pricing, and both our results are achieved through this reduction. Besides its connection to Graph Pricing, the hardness of Generalized Max-Dicut is interesting in its own right since in most arity two CSPs studied in the literature, SDP-based algorithms perform better than LP-based or combinatorial algorithms --- for this arity two CSP, a simple combinatorial algorithm does the best.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Euiwoong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Euiwoong"], "pages": 9}
