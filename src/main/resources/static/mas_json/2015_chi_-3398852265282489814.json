{"title": "How to Drive a London Bus: Measuring Performance in a Mobile and Remote Workplace.", "fields": ["operator", "digital ecosystem", "public transport", "event monitoring", "telematics"], "abstract": "This paper examines how London bus drivers have responded to performance monitoring via a telematics device called Drivewell. This device calculates a score based on various recordable driving-related events like abrupt braking or irregular turning actions. Our qualitative methodology incorporated semi-structured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, in order to explore drivers' attitudes towards the system and its effect on driving behaviour and working conditions. Our findings illustrate how bus operators simultaneously accommodate and resist the demands Drivewell places upon them. Our work also demonstrates how this digital intervention acts in conjunction with other driver-related technologies, creating a unique digital ecosystem on the modern London bus. Our research contributes to HCI understandings of digital surveillance and performance monitoring in the modern workplace.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Northumbria University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gary W.
