As in other sports, proper training leads to a faster buildup of skill and lessens the risk for injuries. We chose a set of exercises from slackline literature and implemented an interactive trainer which guides through the several exercises and gives feedback if the exercise was executed correctly. A post analysis gives the user feedback about her perfomance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "Saarland Inform ... r\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"], "authors": ["Felix Kosmalla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosmalla:Felix", "Christian Murlowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murlowski:Christian", "Florian Daiber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daiber:Florian", "Frederik Wiehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiehr:Frederik", "Antonio Kr\u00fcger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=ger:Antonio"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
