These data arise, for instance, in the analysis of protein interactions and gene regulatory networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks. Analyzing pairwise measurements with probabilistic models requires special assumptions, since the usual independence or exchangeability assumptions no longer hold. Here we introduce a class of variance allocation models for pairwise measurements: mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. These models combine global parameters that instantiate dense patches of connectivity (blockmodel) with local parameters that instantiate node-specific variability in the connections (mixed membership). We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We demonstrate the advantages of mixed membership stochastic blockmodels with applications to social networks and protein interaction networks.", "citation": "Citations (1,505)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Edoardo M.
