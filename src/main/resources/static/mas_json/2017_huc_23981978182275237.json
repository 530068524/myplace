The transition from the textual interfaces of early desktop computing to the graphical user interface brought with it new challenges of access for individuals with a range of visual impairments[3]. Although researchers within HCI and beyond have introduced a multitude of answers to these challenges [8, 19], few have found their way into everyday use by the visually impaired community [30, 6, 7]. Ubicomp offers particularly compelling options for additional modalities that can better assist users with visual impairments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "authors": ["Mark S.
