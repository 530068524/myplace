{"title": "Consent reconsidered; reframing consent for ubiquitous computing systems.", "fields": ["cognitive reframing", "ubiquitous computing", "contextual design", "management science", "design elements and principles"], "abstract": "The developing complexity and decreasing visibility of pervasive computing systems, coupled with increasing value and sensitivity of personal data, mean that it is no longer sufficient to design systems that assume users capable of making informed decisions at a single moment. In particular, the unprecedented sensitivity of contextual data, and the potential harms associated with inferences made on the basis of that data, highlights the need to revisit our design principles in respect of consent. This thesis will use a mixed-methods approach to reframe 'consent' for ubiquitous computing systems, resulting in a series of design guidelines to inform future developments.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Ewa Luger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luger:Ewa"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
