{"title": "The Dynamics of Influence Systems.", "fields": ["renormalization", "almost surely", "turing machine", "dynamic network analysis", "periodic graph"], "abstract": "Influence systems form a large class of multiagent systems designed to model how influence, broadly defined, spreads across a dynamic network. We build a general analytical framework which we then use to prove that, while Turing-complete, influence dynamics of the diffusive type is almost surely asymptotically periodic. Besides resolving the dynamics of a popular family of multiagent systems, the other contribution of this work is to introduce a new type of renormalization-based bifurcation analysis for multiagent systems.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Princeton University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Bernard Chazelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chazelle:Bernard"], "pages": 10}
