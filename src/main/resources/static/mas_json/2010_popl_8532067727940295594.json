Manifestations of these limits appearing in computers include scaling issues in interconnect, dissipation, and coding. Reconfigurable Asynchronous Logic Automata (RALA) is an alternative formulation of computation that seeks to align logical and physical descriptions by exposing rather than hiding this underlying reality. Instead of physical units being represented in computer programs only as abstract symbols, RALA is based on a lattice of cells that asynchronously pass state tokens corresponding to physical resources. We introduce the design of RALA, review its relationships to its many progenitors, and discuss its benefits, implementation, programming, and extensions", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Neil Gershenfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gershenfeld:Neil", "David Dalrymple.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dalrymple:David", "Kailiang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kailiang", "Ara Knaian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knaian:Ara", "Forrest Green.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Green:Forrest", "Erik D.
