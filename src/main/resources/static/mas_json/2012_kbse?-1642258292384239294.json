Interestingly, software developers also use microblog to communicate with one another. Different from traditional media, microblog users tend to focus on recency and informality of content. Many tweet contents are relatively more personal and opinionated, compared to that of traditional news report. Thus, by analyzing microblogs, one could get the up-to-date information about what people are interested in or feel toward a particular topic. In this paper, we describe our microblog observatory that aggregates more than 70,000 Twitter feeds, captures software-related tweets, and computes trends from across topics and time points. Finally, we present the results to the end users via a web interface available at http://research.larc.smu.edu.sg/palanteer/swdev.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Palakorn Achananuparp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achananuparp:Palakorn", "Ibrahim Nelman Lubis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lubis:Ibrahim_Nelman", "Yuan Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0008:Yuan", "David Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo_0001:David", "Ee-Peng Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Ee=Peng"], "pages": 4}
