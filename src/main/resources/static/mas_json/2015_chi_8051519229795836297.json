We interviewed 29 US citizens and conducted 17 talk-out-loud sessions with people who were using one or more social media technologies, such as Facebook and Twitter, to interact in the online public sphere. We identified a number of challenges and workarounds related to public sphere interactions, and used our findings to formulate requirements for new political environments that support the interactions in the public sphere. Through evolving requirements generation, we developed a new political deliberation technology, dubbed Poli, which is an integrated social media environment with the potential to enable more effective interactions in the public sphere. We discuss several remaining questions and limitations to our tool that will drive future work.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Syracuse University", "University of California, Irvine", "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "University of Hawaii at Manoa"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Bryan C.
