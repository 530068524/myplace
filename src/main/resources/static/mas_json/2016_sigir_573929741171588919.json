The World Wide Web provides a huge amount of continuously updated data and information on a wide range of topics created by a variety of content providers, and makes the study of extracted people networks and their temporal evolution valuable for social as well as computer scientists. In this paper we present SocGraph - an extraction and exploration system for social relations from the content of around 2 billion web pages collected by the Internet Archive over the 17 years time period between 1996 and 2013. We describe methods for constructing large social graphs from extracted relations and introduce an interface to study their temporal evolution.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany", "Siersdorfer, Hannover, Germany"], "authors": ["Miroslav Shaltev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shaltev:Miroslav", "Jan-Hendrik Zab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zab:Jan=Hendrik", "Philipp Kemkes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kemkes:Philipp", "Stefan Siersdorfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siersdorfer:Stefan", "Sergej Zerr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zerr:Sergej"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
