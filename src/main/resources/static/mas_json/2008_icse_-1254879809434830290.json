{"title": "State extensions for java pathfinder.", "fields": ["debugging", "model checking", "bytecode", "thread", "software bug"], "abstract": "Java PathFinder (JPF) is an explicit-state model checker for Java programs. JPF implements a backtrackable Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that provides non-deterministic choices and control over thread scheduling. JPF is itself implemented in Java and runs on top of a host JVM. JPF represents the JVM state of the program being checked and performs three main operations on this state representation: bytecode execution, state backtracking, and state comparison. This paper summarizes four extensions that we have developed to the JPF state representation and operations. One extension provides a new functionality to JPF, and three extensions improve performance of JPF in various scenarios. Some of our code has already been included in publicly available JPF.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Belgrade", "University of Belgrade", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Tihomir Gvero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gvero:Tihomir", "Milos Gligoric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gligoric:Milos", "Steven Lauterburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lauterburg:Steven", "Marcelo d'Amorim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/d=Amorim:Marcelo", "Darko Marinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinov:Darko", "Sarfraz Khurshid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khurshid:Sarfraz"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
