{"title": "Expressive Power-Based Resource Allocation for Data Centers.", "fields": ["power management", "autonomic computing", "architecture", "scalability", "market mechanism"], "abstract": "As data-center energy consumption continues to rise, efficient power management is becoming increasingly important. In this work, we examine the use of a novel market mechanism for finding the right balance between power and performance. The market enables a separation between a 'buyer side' that strives to maximize performance and a 'seller side' that strives to minimize power and other costs. A concise and scalable description language is defined for agent preferences that admits a mixedinteger program for computing optimal allocations. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness, flexibility, practicality and scalability of the architecture.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "IBM", "IBM", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Benjamin Lubin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lubin:Benjamin", "Jeffrey O.
