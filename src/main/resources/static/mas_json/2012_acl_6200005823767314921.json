{"title": "Joint Inference of Named Entity Recognition and Normalization for Tweets.", "fields": ["lemma", "boosting", "named entity recognition", "normalization", "binary number"], "abstract": "Tweets represent a critical source of fresh information, in which named entities occur frequently with rich variations. We study the problem of named entity normalization (NEN) for tweets. Two main challenges are the errors propagated from named entity recognition (NER) and the dearth of information in a single tweet. We propose a novel graphical model to simultaneously conduct NER and NEN on multiple tweets to address these challenges. Particularly, our model introduces a binary random variable for each pair of words with the same lemma across similar tweets, whose value indicates whether the two related words are mentions of the same entity. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated data set, and show that our method outperforms the baseline that handles these two tasks separately, boosting the F1 from 80.2% to 83.6% for NER, and the Accuracy from 79.4% to 82.6% for NEN, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Shandong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xiaohua Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaohua", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming", "Xiangyang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiangyang", "Zhongyang Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Zhongyang", "Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu"], "pages": 10}
