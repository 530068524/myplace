But slow growth in cell resistance with time,  resistance drift , can cause transient errors in MLC-PCM. Drift errors increase with time, and prior work suggests refresh before the cell loses data. The need for refresh makes MLC-PCM volatile, taking away a key advantage. Based on the observation that most drift errors occur in a particular state in four-level-cell PCM, we propose to change from four levels to three levels, eliminating the most vulnerable state. This simple change lowers cell drift error rates by many orders of magnitude: three-level-cell PCM can retain data without power for more than ten years. With optimized encoding/decoding and a wearout tolerance mechanism, we can narrow the capacity gap between three-level and four-level cells. These techniques together enable low-cost, high-performance, genuinely nonvolatile MLC-PCM.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["IBM", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Doe Hyun Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Doe_Hyun", "Jichuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Jichuan", "Robert S.
