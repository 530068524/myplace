The winner of the existential k-pebble game on two given finite structures can easily be determined in polynomial time, where the degree of the polynomial is linear in k. We show that this linear dependence on the parameter k is necessary by proving an unconditional polynomial lower bound for determining the winner in the existential k-pebble game on finite structures. Establishing strong k-consistency is a well-known heuristic for solving the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). By the game characterization of Kolaitis and Vardi our result implies a lower bound on every algorithm that decides if strong k-consistency can be established for a given CSP-instance.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Humboldt State University"], "authors": ["Christoph Berkholz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berkholz:Christoph"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
