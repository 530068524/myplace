{"title": "From Shape Analysis to Termination Analysis in Linear Time.", "fields": ["recursion", "time complexity", "termination analysis", "shape analysis", "separation logic"], "abstract": "We present a novel algorithm to conservatively check whether a (recursive) heap-manipulating program terminates. Our algorithm can be used as a post-processing phase of any shape analysis satisfying some natural properties. The running time of the post-processing phase is linear in the size of the output of the chosen shape analysis.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Roman Manevich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manevich:Roman", "Boris Dogadov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dogadov:Boris", "Noam Rinetzky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rinetzky:Noam"], "pages": 21}
