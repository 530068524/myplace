{"title": "Clustering to forecast sparse time-series data.", "fields": ["heuristic", "local search", "constrained clustering", "scalability", "fuzzy clustering"], "abstract": "Forecasting accurately is essential to successful inventory planning in retail. Unfortunately, there is not always enough historical data to forecast items individually- this is particularly true in e-commerce where there is a long tail of low selling items, and items are introduced and phased out quite frequently, unlike physical stores. In such scenarios, it is preferable to forecast items in well-designed groups of similar items, so that data for different items can be pooled together to fit a single model. In this paper, we first discuss the desiderata for such a grouping and how it differs from the traditional clustering problem. We then describe our approach which is a scalable local search heuristic that can naturally handle the constraints required in this setting, besides being capable of producing solutions competitive with well-known clustering algorithms. We also address the complementary problem of estimating similarity, particularly in the case of new items which have no past sales. Our solution is to regress the sales profile of items against their semantic features, so that given just the semantic features of a new item we can predict its relation to other items, in terms of as yet unobserved sales. Our experiments demonstrate both the scalability of our approach and implications for forecast accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Walmart Labs", "Walmart Labs", "Walmart Labs", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Abhay Jha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jha:Abhay", "Shubhankar Ray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ray:Shubhankar", "Brian Seaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seaman:Brian", "Inderjit S.
