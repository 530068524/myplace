{"title": "Navigating big data with high-throughput, energy-efficient data partitioning.", "fields": ["database tuning", "xeon", "software deployment", "microarchitecture", "hardware acceleration"], "abstract": "The global pool of data is growing at 2.5 quintillion bytes per day, with 90% of it produced in the last two years alone [24]. There is no doubt the era of big data has arrived. This paper explores targeted deployment of hardware accelerators to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of large-scale data processing. In particular, data partitioning is a critical operation for manipulating large data sets. It is often the limiting factor in database performance and represents a significant fraction of the overall runtime of large data queries.   To accelerate partitioning, this paper describes a hardware accelerator for range partitioning, or HARP, and a hardware-software data streaming framework. The streaming framework offers a seamless execution environment for streaming accelerators such as HARP. Together, HARP and the streaming framework provide an order of magnitude improvement in partitioning performance and energy. A detailed analysis of a 32 nm  physical design shows 7.8 times the throughput of a highly optimized and optimistic software implementation, while consuming just 6.9% of the area and 4.3% of the power of a single Xeon core in the same technology generation.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Lisa Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Lisa", "Raymond J.
