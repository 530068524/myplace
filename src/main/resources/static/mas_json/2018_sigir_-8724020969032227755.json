{"title": "Learning to Detect Pathogenic Microorganism of Community-acquired Pneumonia.", "fields": ["deep learning", "computer science", "community acquired pneumonia", "artificial intelligence", "data mining"], "abstract": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major death cause for children, requiring an early administration of appropriate antibiotics to cure it. To achieve this, accurate detection of pathogenic microorganism is crucial, especially for reducing the abuse of antibiotics. Conventional gold standard detection methods are mainly etiology based, incurring high cost and labor intensity. Although recently electronic health records (EHRs) become prevalent and widely used, their power for automatically determining pathogenic microorganism has not been investigated. In this paper, we formulate a new problem for automatically detecting pathogenic microorganism of CAP by considering patient biomedical features from EHRs, including time-varying body temperatures and common laboratory measurements. We further develop a Patient Attention based Recurrent Neural Network (PA-RNN) model to fuse different patient features for detection. We conduct experiments on a real dataset, demonstrating utilizing electronic health records yields promising performance and PA-RNN outperforms several alternatives.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "Boston Children's Hospital", "Boston Children's Hospital"], "authors": ["Wenwei Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Wenwei", "Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wei", "Bo Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Bo", "Jiangjiang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jiangjiang", "Linhua Shu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shu:Linhua", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
