{"title": "Enhancing realism in virtual environments by simulating the audio-haptic sensation of walking on ground surfaces.", "fields": ["haptic technology", "surround sound", "soundscape", "sensation", "realism"], "abstract": "In this paper we describe an experiment whose goal is to investigate the role of physics-based auditory and haptic feedback provided at feet level to enhance realism in a virtual environment. To achieve this goal, we designed a multimodal virtual environment where subjects could walk on a platform overlooking a canyon. Subjects were asked to visit the environment wearing an head-mounted display and a custom made pair of sandals enhanced with sensors and actuators. A 12-channels surround sound system delivered a soundscape which was consistent with the visual environment. Passive haptics was provided by having a physical wooden platform present in the laboratory. Subjects reported of having a more realistic experience while auditory and haptic feedback are present. However, measured physiological data and post-experimental presence questionnaire do not show significant differences when audio-haptic feedback is provided.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen", "Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen", "Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen", "Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Rolf Nordahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nordahl:Rolf", "Stefania Serafin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serafin:Stefania", "Niels C.
