{"title": "Creating Your Bubble: Personal Space On and Around Large Public Displays.", "fields": ["territoriality", "interpersonal communication", "personal space", "proxemics", "bubble"], "abstract": "We describe an empirical study that explores how users establish and use personal space around large public displays (LPDs). Our study complements field studies in this space by more fully characterizing interpersonal distances based on coupling and confirms the use of on-screen territories on vertical displays. Finally, we discuss implications for future research: limitations of proxemics and territoriality, how user range can augment existing theory, and the influence of dis- play size on personal space.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["James R.
