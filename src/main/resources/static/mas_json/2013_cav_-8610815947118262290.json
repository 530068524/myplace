{"title": "Automata with Generalized Rabin Pairs for Probabilistic Model Checking and LTL Synthesis.", "fields": ["determinism", "linear temporal logic", "probabilistic logic", "markov decision process", "statistical model"], "abstract": "The model-checking problem for probabilistic systems crucially relies on the translation of LTL to deterministic Rabin automata (DRW). Our recent Safraless translation [KE12, GKE12] for the LTL(F,G) fragment produces smaller automata as compared to the traditional approach. In this work, instead of DRW we consider deterministic automata with acceptance condition given as disjunction of generalized Rabin pairs (DGRW). The Safraless translation of LTL(F,G) formulas to DGRW results in smaller automata as compared to DRW. We present algorithms for probabilistic model-checking as well as game solving for DGRW conditions. Our new algorithms lead to improvement both in terms of theoretical bounds as well as practical evaluation. We compare PRISM with and without our new translation, and show that the new translation leads to significant improvements.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Andreas Gaiser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaiser:Andreas", "Jan Kret\u00ednsk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kret=iacute=nsk=yacute=:Jan"], "pages": 17}
