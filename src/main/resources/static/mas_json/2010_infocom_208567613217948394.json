The salient features of such networks include TDMA channel access, nodes with multiple radios, and point-to-point long-distance wireless links established using high-gain directional antennas mounted on high towers. It has been demonstrated previously that in such network architectures, nodes can transmit concurrently on multiple radios, as well as receive concurrently on multiple radios. However, concurrent transmission on one radio, and reception on another radio causes interference. Under this scheduling constraint, given a set of source-destination demand rates, we consider the problem of satisfying the maximum fraction of each demand (also called the maximum concurrent flow problem). We give a novel joint routing and scheduling scheme for this problem, based on linear programming and graph coloring. We analyze our algorithm theoretically and prove that at least 50\\% of a satisfiable set of demands is satisfied by our algorithm for most practical networks (with maximum node degree at most 5).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IBM", "Motorola", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Partha Dutta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dutta:Partha", "Vivek Mhatre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mhatre:Vivek", "Debmalya Panigrahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panigrahi:Debmalya", "Rajeev Rastogi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rastogi:Rajeev"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
