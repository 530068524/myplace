The entire project was created in Maya 2008 with RenderMan for Maya 2.0, allowing for a rich, deep palette and incredible detail in rendering of displacement maps created with zBrush and Photoshop. This software, along with the latest Mac Pro systems, allowed us to render dense vegetation and large numbers of characters with extensive effects, allowing us to achieve our vision without compromises.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": [], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Laura Citron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Citron:Laura"], "pages": 1}
