{"title": "A Disentangled Recognition and Nonlinear Dynamics Model for Unsupervised Learning.", "fields": ["generative grammar", "missing data", "physical system", "imputation", "unsupervised learning"], "abstract": "This paper takes a step towards temporal reasoning in a dynamically changing video, not in the pixel space that constitutes its frames, but in a latent space that describes the non-linear dynamics of the objects in its world. We introduce the Kalman variational auto-encoder, a framework for unsupervised learning of sequential data that disentangles two latent representations: an object's representation, coming from a recognition model, and a latent state describing its dynamics. As a result, the evolution of the world can be imagined and missing data imputed, both without the need to generate high dimensional frames at each time step. The model is trained end-to-end on videos of a variety of simulated physical systems, and outperforms competing methods in generative and missing data imputation tasks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark", "Google", "Technical University of Denmark"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Marco Fraccaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fraccaro:Marco", "Simon Kamronn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamronn:Simon", "Ulrich Paquet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paquet:Ulrich", "Ole Winther.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winther:Ole"], "pages": 10}
