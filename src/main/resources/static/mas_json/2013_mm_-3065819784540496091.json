This paper concentrates on improving a standardized RTP/RTCP-based solution for IDMS. In particular, novel Early Event-Driven (EED) RTCP feedback reporting mechanisms are designed to overcome latency issues and to enable higher flexibility, dynamism and accuracy when using RTP/RTCP for IDMS. The faster reaction on dynamic situations (e.g., detection of asynchrony or channel change delays) and a finer granularity for synchronizing media-related events, while preserving the RTCP bandwidth bounds, are validated through simulation tests.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Valencia", "Polytechnic University of Valencia", "Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research"], "authors": ["Mario Montagud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montagud:Mario", "Fernando Boronat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boronat:Fernando", "Hans Stokking.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stokking:Hans"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
