Emerging applications such as computational advertising and selective information dissemination demand determining and presenting to an end-user only the most relevant content that is both user-consumable and suitable for limited screen real estate of target devices. To retrieve the most relevant content, we present BE*-Tree, a novel indexing data structure designed for effective hierarchical top-k pattern matching, which as its by-product also reduces the operational cost of processing millions of patterns. To further reduce processing cost, BE*-Tree employs an adaptive and non-rigid space-cutting technique designed to efficiently index Boolean expressions over a high-dimensional continuous space. At the core of BE*-Tree lie two innovative ideas: (1) a bi-directional tree expansion build as a top-down (data and space clustering) and a bottom-up growths (space clustering), which together enable indexing only non-empty continuous sub-spaces, and (2) an overlap-free splitting strategy. Finally, the performance of BE*-Tree is proven through a comprehensive experimental comparison against state-of-the-art index structures for matching Boolean expressions.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mohammad Sadoghi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadoghi:Mohammad", "Hans-Arno Jacobsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobsen:Hans=Arno"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
