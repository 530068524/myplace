Teamwork is a very important factor in complex, dynamic domains. In heterogeneous teams, robustness and flexibility are increased by the diversity of the robots, each contributing different capabilities. In such heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems it is reasonable to explicitly take the robots' capabilities into account when determining which one is best suited for a task. In this paper I present a framework that formalizes robots' capabilities and provides a means to estimate their suitability for a task. In highly unpredictable domains, accurate predictions of the outcomes of a robot's actions are virtually impossible. Approximate models and algorithms are required which help to estimate the outcome with highest possible confidence. The proposed architecture can provide estimates of task solution qualities at three levels of confidence: the lowest level only taking the mere existence of capabilities into account, the middle level considering task-specific details with approximate parameters of the capabilities, and the highest confidence level considering more elaborate planning algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Jennifer Elisabeth Buehler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buehler:Jennifer_Elisabeth"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
