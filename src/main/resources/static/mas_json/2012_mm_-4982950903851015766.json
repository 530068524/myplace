Given the popularity of mobile music devices with rich sensing and wireless communication capabilities, we present in this paper a novel approach to employ contextual information collected with mobile devices for satisfying users' short-term music playing needs. We present a probabilistic model to integrate contextual information with music content analysis to offer music recommendation for daily activities, and we present a prototype implementation of the model. Finally, we present evaluation results demonstrating good accuracy and usability of the model and prototype.", "citation": "Citations (155)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Xinxi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinxi", "David S.
