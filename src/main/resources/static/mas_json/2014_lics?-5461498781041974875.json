{"title": "On periodically iterated morphisms.", "fields": ["open problem", "undecidable problem", "iterated function", "periodic graph", "fractran"], "abstract": "We investigate the computational power of periodically iterated morphisms, also known as D0L systems with periodic control; we call them PerD0L systems for short. These systems give rise to a class of one-sided infinite sequences, called PerD0L words. We construct a PerD0L word with exponential subword complexity, thereby answering a question raised by Lepisto [23] on the existence of such words. We solve another open problem concerning the decidability of the first-order theories of PerD0L words [24]; we show it is already undecidable whether a certain letter occurs in a PerD0L word.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["VU University Amsterdam", "VU University Amsterdam"], "authors": ["J\u00f6rg Endrullis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Endrullis:J=ouml=rg", "Dimitri Hendriks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hendriks:Dimitri"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
