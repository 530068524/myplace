{"title": "Oversubscription Planning: Complexity and Compilability.", "fields": ["continuation", "information and computer science", "planner", "computational complexity theory", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Many real-world planning problems are oversubscription problems where all goals are not simultaneously achievable and the planner needs to find a feasible subset. We present complexity results for the so-called partial satisfaction and net benefit problems under various restrictions; this extends previous work by van den Briel et al. Our results reveal strong connections between these problems and with classical planning. We also present a method for efficiently compiling oversubscription problems into the ordinary plan existence problem; this can be viewed as a continuation of earlier work by Keyder & Geffner.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Link\u00f6ping University", "Link\u00f6ping University"], "authors": ["Meysam Aghighi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aghighi:Meysam", "Peter Jonsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jonsson:Peter"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
