That is, we are given the root of the tree and access to a black box which, given a vertex  v , outputs the children of  v .   We construct a quantum algorithm which, given such access to a search tree of depth at most  n , estimates the size of the tree  T  within a factor of 1\u00b1 I\ufffd in \ufffd (\u00e2   nT ) steps. More generally, the same algorithm can be used to estimate size of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in a similar model.   We then show two applications of this result: a) We show how to transform a classical backtracking search algorithm which examines  T  nodes of a search tree into an \ufffd (\u00e2   T  n  3/2 ) time quantum algorithm, improving over an earlier quantum backtracking algorithm of Montanaro (arXiv:1509.02374). b)We give a quantum algorithm for evaluating AND-OR formulas in a model where the formula can be discovered by local exploration (modeling position trees in 2-player games) which evaluates formulas of size  T  and depth  T   o (1)  in time  O ( T  1/2+ o (1) ). Thus, the quantum speedup is essentially the same as in the case when the formula is known in advance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Latvia", "University of Latvia"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Andris Ambainis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ambainis:Andris", "Martins Kokainis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kokainis:Martins"], "pages": 14}
