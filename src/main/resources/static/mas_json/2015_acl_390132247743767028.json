{"title": "Encoding Source Language with Convolutional Neural Network for Machine Translation.", "fields": ["bleu", "machine translation", "convolutional neural network", "nist", "sentence"], "abstract": "The recently proposed neural network joint model (NNJM) (Devlin et al., 2014) augments the n-gram target language model with a heuristically chosen source context window, achieving state-of-the-art performance in SMT. In this paper, we give a more systematic treatment by summarizing the relevant source information through a convolutional architecture guided by the target information. With different guiding signals during decoding, our specifically designed convolution+gating architectures can pinpoint the parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, and fuse them with the context of entire source sentence to form a unified representation. This representation, together with target language words, are fed to a deep neural network (DNN) to form a stronger NNJM. Experiments on two NIST Chinese-English translation tasks show that the proposed model can achieve significant improvements over the previous NNJM by up to +1.08 BLEU points on average", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Huawei"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Fandong Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Fandong", "Zhengdong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhengdong", "Mingxuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Mingxuan", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Hang", "Wenbin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Wenbin", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun"], "pages": 11}
