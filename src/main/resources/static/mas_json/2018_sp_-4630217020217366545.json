{"title": "OmniLedger: A Secure, Scale-Out, Decentralized Ledger via Sharding.", "fields": ["commit", "payment processor", "compromise", "ledger", "transaction processing"], "abstract": "Designing a secure permissionless distributed ledger (blockchain) that performs on par with centralized payment processors, such as Visa, is a challenging task. Most existing distributed ledgers are unable to scale-out, i.e., to grow their total processing capacity with the number of validators; and those that do, compromise security or decentralization. We present OmniLedger, a novel scale-out distributed ledger that preserves longterm security under permissionless operation. It ensures security and correctness by using a bias-resistant public-randomness protocol for choosing large, statistically representative shards that process transactions, and by introducing an efficient cross-shard commit protocol that atomically handles transactions affecting multiple shards. OmniLedger also optimizes performance via parallel intra-shard transaction processing, ledger pruning via collectively-signed state blocks, and low-latency \"trust-but-verify\" validation for low-value transactions. An evaluation of our experimental prototype shows that OmniLedger\u2019s throughput scales linearly in the number of active validators, supporting Visa-level workloads and beyond, while confirming typical transactions in under two seconds.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Trinity College"], "authors": ["Eleftherios Kokoris-Kogias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kokoris=Kogias:Eleftherios", "Philipp Jovanovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jovanovic:Philipp", "Linus Gasser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gasser:Linus", "Nicolas Gailly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gailly:Nicolas", "Ewa Syta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Syta:Ewa", "Bryan Ford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ford:Bryan"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2018", "pages": 16}
