{"title": "BIGnav: Bayesian Information Gain for Guiding Multiscale Navigation.", "fields": ["bayesian experimental design", "mutual information", "turn by turn navigation", "point of interest", "zoom"], "abstract": "This paper introduces BIGnav, a new multiscale navigation technique based on Bayesian Experimental Design where the criterion is to maximize the information-theoretic concept of mutual information, also known as information gain. Rather than simply executing user navigation commands, BIGnav interprets user input to update its knowledge about the user's intended target. Then it navigates to a new view that maximizes the information gain provided by the user's expected subsequent input. We conducted a controlled experiment demonstrating that BIGnav is significantly faster than conventional pan and zoom and requires fewer commands for distant targets, especially in non-uniform information spaces. We also applied BIGnav to a realistic application and showed that users can navigate to highly probable points of interest on a map with only a few steps. We then discuss the tradeoffs of BIGnav--including efficiency vs. increased cognitive load--and its application to other interaction tasks.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "State University of Campinas", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Wanyu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wanyu", "Rafael Lucas D'Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=Oliveira:Rafael_Lucas", "Michel Beaudouin-Lafon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beaudouin=Lafon:Michel", "Olivier Rioul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rioul:Olivier"], "pages": 12}
