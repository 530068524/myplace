{"title": "A probabilistic topic-based ranking framework for location-sensitive domain information retrieval.", "fields": ["okapi bm25", "ranking", "cognitive models of information retrieval", "adversarial information retrieval", "divergence from randomness model"], "abstract": "It has been observed that many queries submitted to search engines are location-sensitive. Traditional search techniques fail to interpret the significance of such geographical clues and as such are unable to return highly relevant search results. Although there have been efforts in the literature to support location-aware information retrieval, critical challenges still remain in terms of search result quality and data scalability. In this paper, we propose an innovative probabilistic ranking framework for domain information retrieval where users are interested in a set of location-sensitive topics. Our proposed method recognizes the geographical distribution of topic influence in the process of ranking documents and models it accurately using probabilistic Gaussian Process classifiers. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking framework by implementing it in a Web search service for NBA news. Extensive performance evaluation is performed on real Web document collections, which confirms that our proposed mechanism works significantly better (around 29.7% averagely using DCG20 measure) than other popular location-aware information retrieval techniques in ranking quality.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "The Shenzhen In ...
