In this paper, we answer the fundamental question of characterizing the level of overall privacy degradation as a function of the number of queries and the privacy levels maintained by each privatization mechanism. Our solution is complete: we prove an upper bound on the overall privacy level and construct a sequence of privatization mechanisms that achieves this bound. The key innovation is the introduction of an operational interpretation of differential privacy (involving hypothesis testing) and the use of a data processing inequality along with its converse. Our result improves over the state of the art, and has immediate connections to several problems studied in the literature.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Peter Kairouz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kairouz:Peter", "Sewoong Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Sewoong", "Pramod Viswanath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viswanath:Pramod"], "pages": 10}
