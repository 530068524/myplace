{"title": "CSALT: context switch aware large TLB.", "fields": ["context switch", "page table", "translation lookaside buffer", "virtualization", "cache"], "abstract": "Computing in virtualized environments has become a common practice for many businesses. Typically, hosting companies aim for lower operational costs by targeting high utilization of host machines maintaining just  enough  machines to meet the demand. In this scenario, frequent virtual machine context switches are common, resulting in increased TLB miss rates (often, by over 5 X  when contexts are doubled) and subsequent expensive page walks. Since each TLB miss in a virtual environment initiates a 2D page walk, the data caches get filled with a large fraction of page table entries (often, in excess of 50%) thereby evicting potentially more useful data contents.   In this work, we propose  CSALT  - a Context-Switch Aware Large TLB, to address the problem of increased TLB miss rates and their adverse impact on data caches. First, we demonstrate that the  CSALT  architecture can effectively cope with the demands of increased context switches by its capacity to store a very large number of TLB entries. Next, we show that  CSALT  mitigates data cache contention caused by conflicts between data and translation entries by employing a novel  TLB-Aware Cache Partitioning  scheme. On 8-core systems that switch between two virtual machine contexts executing multi-threaded workloads,  CSALT  achieves an average performance improvement of 85% over a baseline with conventional L1-L2 TLBs and 25% over a baseline which has a large L3 TLB.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Texas Instruments", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Yashwant Marathe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marathe:Yashwant", "Nagendra Gulur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gulur:Nagendra", "Jee Ho Ryoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryoo:Jee_Ho", "Shuang Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Shuang", "Lizy K.
