This improves upon previous explicit constructions when $\\eps$ is roughly (ignoring logarithmic factors) in the range $[k^{-1.5}, k^{-0.5}]$. The construction builds on an algebraic-geometric code. However, unlike previous constructions we use low-degree divisors whose degree is significantly smaller than the genus. Studying the limits of our technique, we arrive at a hypothesis that if true implies the existence of $\\eps$-biased sets with parameters nearly matching the lower bound, and in particular giving binary error correcting codes beating the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Avraham Ben-Aroya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Aroya:Avraham", "Amnon Ta-Shma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Ta=Shma:Amnon"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
