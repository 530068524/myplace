In this paper we present a new approach for the construction of LDCs. We show that if there exists an irreducible representation (\u03c1, V) of G and q elements g 1 ,g 2 ,..., g q  in G such that there exists a linear combination of matrices \u03c1(g i ) that is of rank one, then we can construct a q-query Locally Decodable Code C:V-> F G .   We show the potential of this approach by constructing constant query LDCs of sub-exponential length matching the best known constructions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Klim Efremenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efremenko:Klim"], "pages": 12}
