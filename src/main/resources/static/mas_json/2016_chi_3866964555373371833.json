{"title": "The Impact of the Encoding View in Location-Based Reminders: Improving Prospective Remembering.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "recall", "multimedia", "prospective memory", "encoding"], "abstract": "Proliferation of small computing-enabled devices coupled with the richness of communication infrastructure has made location-based computing a reality. Location-based reminders (LBRs) provide alarms and notices to users based on their location. These are typically used to remind us to complete a to-do task at a particular location. The current design of LBRs fails to take advantage of prospective memory theory. We hypothesize that if the encoding stage provides a closer match to the retrieval stage, then location recognition and task recall in LBRs will improve at retrieval time. We conducted a between subjects experiment and measured performance as location recognition and task recall. We found strong evidence in support that a first-person view benefits prospective remembering the most. We close with a discussion of the implications for the design of the encoding stage for future LBR systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Samsung", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yao", "Mark Schlager.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlager:Mark", "Manuel A.
