{"title": "Dealing with Multiple Classes in Online Class Imbalance Learning.", "fields": ["adaptive sampling", "ensemble learning", "resampling", "data stream mining", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Online class imbalance learning deals with data streams having very skewed class distributions in a timely fashion. Although a few methods have been proposed to handle such problems, most of them focus on two-class cases. Multi-class imbalance imposes additional challenges in learning. This paper studies the combined challenges posed by multiclass imbalance and online learning, and aims at a more effective and adaptive solution. First, we introduce two resampling-based ensemble methods, called MOOB and MUOB, which can process multi-class data directly and strictly online with an adaptive sampling rate. Then, we look into the impact of multi-minority and multi-majority cases on MOOB and MUOB in comparison to other methods under stationary and dynamic scenarios. Both multi-minority and multi-majority make a negative impact. MOOB shows the best and most stable G-mean in most stationary and dynamic cases.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Birmingham", "University of Leicester", "University of Birmingham"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Shuo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0005:Shuo", "Leandro L.
