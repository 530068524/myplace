Single object tracking on monocular video streams is fairly well understood. However, when it comes to multiple objects, existing methods lack scalability and can recognize only a limited number of objects. Thanks to recent progress in feature matching, state-of-the-art image retrieval techniques can deal with millions of images. However, these methods do not focus on real-time video processing and can not track retrieved objects. In this paper, we present a method that combines the speed and accuracy of tracking with the scalability of image retrieval. At the heart of our approach is a bi-layer clustering process that allows our system to index and retrieve objects based on tracks of features, thereby effectively summarizing the information available on multiple video frames. As a result, our system is able to track in real-time multiple objects, recognized with low delay from a database of more than 300 entries.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Julien Pilet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilet:Julien", "Hideo Saito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saito:Hideo"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
