While different program-slicing techniques have been proposed for traditional software systems, program slicing for dynamic web applications is challenging since the client-side code is generated from the server-side code and data entities are referenced across different languages and are often embedded in string literals in the server-side program. To address those challenges, we introduce WebSlice, an approach to compute program slices across different languages for web applications. We first identify data-flow dependencies among data entities for PHP code based on symbolic execution. We also compute SQL queries and a conditional DOM that represents client-code variations and construct the data flows for embedded languages: SQL, HTML, and JavaScript. Next, we connect the data flows across different languages and across PHP pages. Finally, we compute a program slice for a given entity based on the established data flows. Running WebSlice on five real-world, open-source PHP systems, we found that, out of 40,670 program slices, 10% cross languages, 38% cross files, and 13% cross string fragments, demonstrating the potential benefit of tool support for cross-language program slicing in dynamic web applications.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Hung Viet Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hung_Viet", "Christian K\u00e4stner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=auml=stner:Christian", "Tien N.
