Along with its applications to various NLP tasks, much work have put efforts into multilingual subjectivity learning from existing resources. Multilingual subjectivity analysis requires language-independent criteria for comparable outcomes across languages. This paper proposes to measure the multilanguage-comparability of subjectivity analysis tools, and provides meaningful comparisons of multilingual subjectivity analysis from various points of view.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jungi Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jungi", "Jinji Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jinji", "Jong-Hyeok Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jong=Hyeok"], "pages": 9}
