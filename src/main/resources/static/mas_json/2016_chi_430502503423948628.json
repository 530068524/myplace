{"title": "From Research Prototype to Research Product.", "fields": ["everyday life", "human computer interaction", "design research", "interpersonal relationship", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "Prototypes and prototyping have had a long and important history in the HCI community and have played a highly significant role in creating technology that is easier and more fulfilling to use. Yet, as focus in HCI is expanding to investigate complex matters of human relationships with technology over time in the intimate and contested contexts of everyday life, the notion of a 'prototype' may not be fully sufficient to support these kinds of inquiries. We propose the research product as an extension and evolution of the research prototype to support generative inquiries in this emerging research area. We articulate four interrelated qualities of research products inquiry-driven, finish, fit, and independent and draw on these qualities to describe and analyze five different yet related design research cases we have collectively conducted over the past six years. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and opportunities for crafting research products and the implications they suggest for future design-oriented HCI research.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "KAIST", "Simon Fraser University", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["William Odom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Odom:William", "Ron Wakkary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wakkary:Ron", "Youn-Kyung Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Youn=Kyung", "Audrey Desjardins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desjardins:Audrey", "Bart Hengeveld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hengeveld:Bart", "Richard Banks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banks:Richard"], "pages": 13}
