We define an equality relation indexed by rationals: a = e b which we think of as saying that \"a is approximately equal to b up to an error of e \". We have 4 interesting examples where we have a quantitative equational theory whose free algebras correspond to well known structures. In each case we have finitary and continuous versions. The four cases are: Hausdorff metrics from quantitive semilattices; p-Wasserstein metrics (hence also the Kantorovich metric) from barycentric algebras and also from pointed barycentric algebras and the total variation metric from a variant of barycentric algebras.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "McGill University", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Radu Mardare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mardare:Radu", "Prakash Panangaden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panangaden:Prakash", "Gordon D.
