{"title": "Standing Out from the Crowd: Emotional Labor, Body Labor, and Temporal Labor in Ridesharing.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "sharing economy", "computer supported cooperative work", "emotional labor", "labor relations"], "abstract": "CSCW researchers have become interested in crowd work as a new form of collaborative engagement, that is, as a new way in which people\u00e2  s actions are coordinated in order to achieve collective effects. We address this area but from a different perspective \u00e2   that of the labor practices involved in taking crowd work as a form of work. Using empirical materials from a study of ride-sharing, we draw inspiration from studies of the immaterial forms of labor and alternate analyses of political economy that can cast a new light on the context of crowd labor that might matter for CSCW researchers.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Noopur Raval.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raval:Noopur", "Paul Dourish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dourish:Paul"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
