{"title": "Prediction of atomic web services reliability based on k-means clustering.", "fields": ["predictive modelling", "recommender system", "k means clustering", "scalability", "web application"], "abstract": "Contemporary web applications are often designed as composite services built by coordinating atomic services with the aim of providing the appropriate functionality. Although functional properties of each atomic service assure correct functionality of the entire application, nonfunctional properties such as availability, reliability, or security might significantly influence the user-perceived quality of the application. In this paper, we present CLUS, a model for reliability prediction of atomic web services that improves state-of-the-art approaches used in modern recommendation systems. CLUS predicts the reliability for the ongoing service invocation using the data collected from previous invocations. We improve the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art prediction models by considering user-, service- and environment-specific parameters of the invocation context. To address the computational performance related to scalability issues, we aggregate the available previous invocation data using K-means clustering algorithm. We evaluated our model by conducting experiments on services deployed in different regions of the Amazon cloud. The evaluation results suggest that our model improves both performance and accuracy of the prediction when compared to the current state-of-the-art models.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Zagreb", "University of Zagreb", "University of Zagreb"], "authors": ["Marin Silic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silic:Marin", "Goran Delac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delac:Goran", "Sinisa Srbljic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srbljic:Sinisa"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 11}
