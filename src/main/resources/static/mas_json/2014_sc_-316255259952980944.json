For high performance computing (HPC) applications with iterative communication, rich offline analysis of such communication can improve performance by optimizing the mapping. Unfortunately, current practices for at-scale HPC consider only the communication graph and network topology in solving this problem.   We propose Routing Algorithm aware Hierarchical Task Mapping ( RAHTM ) which leverages the knowledge of the routing algorithm to improve task mapping.  RAHTM  achieves high-quality mappings by combining (1) a divide-and-conquer strategy to achieve scalability, (2) a limited search of mappings, and (3) a linear programming based routing-aware approach to evaluate possible mappings in the search space.  RAHTM  achieves 20% reduction in the communication time and 9% reduction in the overall execution time for three communication-heavy benchmarks scaled up to 16,384 processes on a Blue Gene/Q platform.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Ahmed H.
