Google and Bing have emerged as the duopoly that largely arbitrates which English language documents are seen by web searchers. A recent study shows that there is now a large overlap in the top organic search results produced by them. Thus, citizens may no longer be able to gain different perspectives by using different search engines.   We present the results of our empirical study that indicates that by mining Twitter data one can obtain search results that are quite distinct from those produced by Google and Bing. Additionally, our user study found that these results were quite informative. The gauntlet is now on search engines to test whether our findings hold in their infrastructure for different social networks and whether enabling diversity has sufficient business imperative for them.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Boston University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Data Insights L ... n Jose, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Rakesh Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal_0001:Rakesh", "Behzad Golshan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golshan:Behzad", "Evangelos E.
