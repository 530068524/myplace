{"title": "Wide-Area Image Geolocalization with Aerial Reference Imagery.", "fields": ["semantic feature", "georeference", "convolutional neural network", "feature", "feature detection"], "abstract": "We propose to use deep convolutional neural networks to address the problem of cross-view image geolocalization, in which the geolocation of a ground-level query image is estimated by matching to georeferenced aerial images. We use state-of-the-art feature representations for ground-level images and introduce a cross-view training approach for learning a joint semantic feature representation for aerial images. We also propose a network architecture that fuses features extracted from aerial images at multiple spatial scales. To support training these networks, we introduce a massive database that contains pairs of aerial and ground-level images from across the United States. Our methods significantly out-perform the state of the art on two benchmark datasets. We also show, qualitatively, that the proposed feature representations are discriminative at both local and continental spatial scales.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Kentucky", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of Kentucky"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Scott Workman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Workman:Scott", "Richard Souvenir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Souvenir:Richard", "Nathan Jacobs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobs:Nathan"], "pages": 9}
