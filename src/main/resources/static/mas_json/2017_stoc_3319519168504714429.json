Even though Bhaskara et al.\u00e2  s state-of-the-art algorithm for the problem achieves only  O ( n  1/4 + I\u00b5 ) approximation ratio, previous attempts at proving hardness of approximation, including those under average case assumptions, fail to achieve a polynomial ratio; the best ratios ruled out under any worst case assumption and any average case assumption are only any constant (Raghavendra and Steurer) and 2 I\u00a9(log 2/3   n )  (Alon et al.) respectively.   In this work, we show, assuming the exponential time hypothesis (ETH), that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that approximates Densest  k -Subgraph to within  n  1/(loglog n )  c    factor of the optimum, where  c  > 0 is a universal constant independent of  n . In addition, our result has perfect completeness, meaning that we prove that it is ETH-hard to even distinguish between the case in which  G  contains a  k -clique and the case in which every induced  k -subgraph of  G  has density at most 1/ n  \u00e2  1/(loglog n )  c    in polynomial time.   Moreover, if we make a stronger assumption that there is some constant I\u00b5 > 0 such that no subexponential-time algorithm can distinguish between a satisfiable 3SAT formula and one which is only (1 \u00e2   I\u00b5)-satisfiable (also known as Gap-ETH), then the ratio above can be improved to  n   f ( n )  for any function  f  whose limit is zero as  n  goes to infinity (i.e.  f  \u00e2    o (1)).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Pasin Manurangsi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manurangsi:Pasin"], "pages": 8}
