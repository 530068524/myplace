{"title": "Robust Estimators in High Dimensions without the Computational Intractability.", "fields": ["hypercube", "estimator", "adversary", "gaussian", "generalization error"], "abstract": "We study high-dimensional distribution learning in an agnostic setting where an adversary is allowed to arbitrarily corrupt an epsilon fraction of the samples. Such questions have a rich history spanning statistics, machine learning and theoretical computer science. Even in the most basic settings, the only known approaches are either computationally inefficient or lose dimension dependent factors in their error guarantees. This raises the following question: Is high-dimensional agnostic distribution learning even possible, algorithmically? In this work, we obtain the first computationally efficient algorithms for agnostically learning several fundamental classes of high-dimensional distributions: (1) a single Gaussian, (2) a product distribution on the hypercube, (3) mixtures of two product distributions (under a natural balancedness condition), and (4) mixtures of k Gaussians with identical spherical covariances. All our algorithms achieve error that is independent of the dimension, and in many cases depends nearly-linearly on the fraction of adversarially corrupted samples. Moreover, we develop a general recipe for detecting and correcting corruptions in high-dimensions, that may be applicable to many other problems.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, San Diego", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "School of Informatics"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Ilias Diakonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakonikolas:Ilias", "Gautam Kamath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamath:Gautam", "Daniel M.
