The ORCHESTRA system addresses these needs by providing data transformation and exchange capabilities across DBMSs, combined with archived storage of all database versions. ORCHESTRA adopts a peer-to-peer architecture in which individual collaborators contribute data and compute resources, but where there may be no dedicated server or compute cluster.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Nicholas E.
