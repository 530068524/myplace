{"title": "Generalized Singular Value Thresholding.", "fields": ["bounded function", "singular value", "monotone polygon", "argument", "solver"], "abstract": "This work studies the Generalized Singular Value Thresholding (GSVT) operator Prox\u03c3g(\u00b7), Prox\u03c3g(B) = arg minx \u2211mi=1 g(\u03c3i(X)) + 1/2 ||X - B||2F, associated with a nonconvex function g defined on the singular values of X. We prove that GSVT can be obtained by performing the proximal operator of g (denoted as Proxg(\u00b7)) on the singular values since Proxg(\u00b7) is monotone when g is lower bounded. If the nonconvex g satisfies some conditions (many popular nonconvex surrogate functions, e.g., lp-norm, 0 < p < 1, of l0-norm are special cases), a general solver to find Proxg(b) is proposed for any b \u2265 0. GSVT greatly generalizes the known Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) which is a basic subroutine in many convex low rank minimization methods. We are able to solve the nonconvex low rank minimization problem by using GSVT in place of SVT.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "National University of Singapore", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Canyi Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Canyi", "Changbo Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Changbo", "Chunyan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chunyan", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng", "Zhouchen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhouchen"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
