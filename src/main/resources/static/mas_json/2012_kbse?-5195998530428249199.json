{"title": "Generating model transformation rules from examples using an evolutionary algorithm.", "fields": ["declarative programming", "genetic programming", "class diagram", "executable", "model transformation"], "abstract": "We propose an evolutionary approach to automatically generate model transformation rules from a set of examples. To this end, genetic programming is adapted to the problem of model transformation in the presence of complex input/output relationships (i.e., models conforming to meta-models) by generating declarative programs (i.e., transformation rules in this case). Our approach does not rely on prior transformation traces for the model-example pairs, and directly generates executable, many-to-many rules with complex conditions. The applicability of the approach is illustrated with the well-known problem of transforming UML class diagrams into relational schemas, using examples collected from the literature.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Martin Faunes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faunes:Martin", "Houari A.
