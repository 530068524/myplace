In order to provide a transportable system that works in areas where there are no ceilings, we provide an integrated unit (1.3m height) that stands on the floor. One unsolved challenge for laser projectors is to cover large projection areas while providing high resolution at the same time. Our focus + context laser projector solves this problem. BaseLase can cover a large context area in low resolution, while providing three movable high-resolution focus spots. We provide a convex mirror design that enables the laser to reach a large area (75m2) with low resolution while decreasing the beam divergence compared to spherical or parabolic mirrors. This hyperboloidal mirror shape approximately equalizes the point size on the floor independent from the projected location. We propose to add a number of planar mirrors on pan-tilt units to create dynamic zones of high resolution that can adjust to the user behavior. We provide example applications for BaseLase and report on user experience in preliminary trials.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:J=ouml=rg", "Dieter Eberle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eberle:Dieter", "Constantin Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Constantin"], "pages": 10}
