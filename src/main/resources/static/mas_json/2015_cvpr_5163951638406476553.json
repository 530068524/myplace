In this paper, we learn a weakly supervised semantic segmentation model from social images whose labels are not pixel-level but image-level; furthermore, these labels might be noisy. We present a joint conditional random field model leveraging various contexts to address this issue. More specifically, we extract global and local features in multiple scales by convolutional neural network and topic model. Inter-label correlations are captured by visual contextual cues and label co-occurrence statistics. The label consistency between image-level and pixel-level is finally achieved by iterative refinement. Experimental results on two real-world image datasets PASCAL VOC2007 and SIFT-Flow demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and even achieves accuracy comparable with fully supervised methods.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0016:Wei", "Sheng Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Sheng", "Dequan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Dequan", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang"], "pages": 9}
