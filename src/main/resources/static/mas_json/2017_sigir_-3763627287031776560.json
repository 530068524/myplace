{"title": "ENCORE: External Neural Constraints Regularized Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction.", "fields": ["credibility", "artificial neural network", "knowledge base", "relationship extraction", "heuristic"], "abstract": "Distant Supervision is a widely used approach for training relation extraction models. It generates noisy training samples by heuristically labeling a corpus using an existing knowledge base. Previous noise reduction methods for distant supervision fail to utilize information such as data credibility and sample confidence. In this paper, we proposed a novel neural framework, named ENCORE (External Neural COnstraints REgularized distant supervision), which allows an integration of other information for standard DS through regularizations under multiple external neural networks. In ENCORE, a teacher-student co-training mechanism is used to iterative distilling information from external neural networks to an existing relation extraction model. The experiment results demonstrated that without increasing any data or reshaping its original structure, ENCORE enhanced a CNN based relation extraction model for over 12%. The enhanced model also outperforms the state-of-the-art relation extraction method on the same dataset.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Siliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Siliang", "Jinjian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jinjian", "Ning Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ning", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Jun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0001:Jun", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
