{"title": "Small, medium, or large?: estimating the user-perceived scale of stroke gestures.", "fields": ["perception", "estimator", "bayes theorem", "gesture", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "We show that large consensus exists among users in the way they articulate stroke gestures at various scales (i.e.,  small, medium , and  large ), and formulate a simple rule that estimates the user-intended scale of input gestures with 87% accuracy. Our estimator can enhance current gestural interfaces by leveraging scale as a natural parameter for gesture input, reflective of user perception (i.e., no training required). Gesture scale can simplify gesture set design, improve gesture-to-function mappings, and reduce the need for users to learn and for recognizers to discriminate unnecessary symbols.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["university of lille", "university of lille", "University Stef ... uceava, Romania"], "authors": ["Radu-Daniel Vatavu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vatavu:Radu=Daniel", "G\u00e9ry Casiez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casiez:G=eacute=ry", "Laurent Grisoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grisoni:Laurent"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
