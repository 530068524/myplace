Dan has no spine and therefore cannot stand up to the bullying of his sphere-shaped wife. But then Mary leaves him, and Dan begins to grow an exoskeletal backbone and other strange, beautiful growths. What has happened? Can he continue to grow, or will he revert to his former self when Mary returns?", "citation": "Citations (335)", "departments": ["National Film B ...
