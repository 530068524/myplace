Existing pattern matching techniques, however, can provide only limited performance for expensive queries in real-world applications, which may involve Kleene closure patterns, flexible event selection strategies, and events with imprecise timestamps. To support these expensive queries with high performance, we begin our study by analyzing the complexity of pattern queries, with a focus on the fundamental understanding of which features make pattern queries more expressive and at the same time more computationally expensive. This analysis allows us to identify performance bottlenecks in processing those expensive queries, and provides key insights for us to develop a series of optimizations to mitigate those bottlenecks. Microbenchmark results show superior performance of our system for expensive pattern queries while most state-of-the-art systems suffer from poor performance. A thorough case study on Hadoop cluster monitoring further demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed techniques.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Haopeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haopeng", "Yanlei Diao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diao:Yanlei", "Neil Immerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Immerman:Neil"], "pages": 12}
