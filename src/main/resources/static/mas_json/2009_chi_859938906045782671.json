However, this same growth has made it difficult to characterize its content and coverage. In this paper we develop measures to map Wikipedia using its socially annotated, hierarchical category structure. We introduce a mapping technique that takes advantage of socially-annotated hierarchical categories while dealing with the inconsistencies and noise inherent in the distributed way that they are generated. The technique is demonstrated through two applications: mapping the distribution of topics in Wikipedia and how they have changed over time; and mapping the degree of conflict found in each topic area. We also discuss the utility of the approach for other applications and datasets involving collaboratively annotated category hierarchies.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "PARC", "PARC"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Aniket Kittur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kittur:Aniket", "Ed H.
