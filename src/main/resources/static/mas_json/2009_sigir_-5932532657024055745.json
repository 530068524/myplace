{"title": "Web-derived resources for web information retrieval: from conceptual hierarchies to attribute hierarchies.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "knowledge acquisition", "exploit", "named entity", "web search query"], "abstract": "A weakly-supervised extraction method identifies concepts within conceptual hierarchies, at the appropriate level of specificity (e.g.,  Bank  vs.  Institution ), to which attributes (e.g.,  routing number ) extracted from unstructured text best apply. The extraction exploits labeled classes of instances acquired from a combination of Web documents and query logs, and inserted into existing conceptual hierarchies. The correct concept is identified within the top three positions on average over gold-standard attributes, which corresponds to higher accuracy than in alternative experiments.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Marius Pasca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasca:Marius", "Enrique Alfonseca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alfonseca:Enrique"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
