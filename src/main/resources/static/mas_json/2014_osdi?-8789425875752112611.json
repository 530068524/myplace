{"title": "Pebbles: Fine-Grained Data Management Abstractions for Modern Operating Systems.", "fields": ["relational database", "android", "abstraction", "operating system", "data management"], "abstract": "Support for fine-grained data management has all but disappeared from modern operating systems such as Android and iOS. Instead, we must rely on each individual application to manage our data properly - e.g., to delete our emails, documents, and photos in full upon request; to not collect more data than required for its function; and to back up our data to reliable backends. Yet, research studies and media articles constantly remind us of the poor data management practices applied by our applications. We have developed Pebbles, a fine-grained data management system that enables management at a powerful new level of abstraction: application-level data objects, such as emails, documents, notes, notebooks, bank accounts, etc. The key contribution is Pebbles's ability to discover such high-level objects in arbitrary applications without requiring any input from or modifications to these applications. Intuitively, it seems impossible for an OS-level service to understand object structures in unmodified applications, however we observe that the high-level storage abstractions embedded in modern OSes - relational databases and object-relational mappers - bear significant structural information that makes object recognition possible and accurate.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "University of Texas at Austin", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Riley Spahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spahn:Riley", "Jonathan Bell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bell_0001:Jonathan", "Michael Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Michael", "Sravan Bhamidipati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhamidipati:Sravan", "Roxana Geambasu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geambasu:Roxana", "Gail E.
