{"title": "Data-Driven Investigations of Culinary Patterns in Traditional Recipes Across the World.", "fields": ["recipe", "flavor", "popularity", "tweaking", "data driven"], "abstract": "Cultures around the world have acquired unique culinary practices reflected in traditional recipe compositions. Data-driven analysis has the potential to provide interesting insights into the structure of recipes and organizational principles of cuisines. We provide a curated compilation of 45772 traditional recipes from over 22 regions across the world. Using this resource in conjunction with data of flavor molecules from natural ingredients, we implement data-driven investigations for probing flavor pairing patterns in these recipes. Our analysis reveals non-random recipe compositions characterized with either 'uniform' or 'contrasting' flavor blending and identifies popularity of ingredients as a key contributing factor across all cuisines. Thus we provide a framework for data-driven investigations of culinary patterns in recipes which can be leveraged for applications aimed at food design, generating novel flavor pairings and tweaking recipes for better nutrition and health.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology", "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology"], "authors": ["Ganesh Bagler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagler:Ganesh", "Navjot Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Navjot"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
