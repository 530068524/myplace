This paper lays out guidelines that can be used by system designers to navigate the RDMA design space. Our guidelines emphasize paying attention to low-level details such as individual PCIe transactions and NIC architecture. We empirically demonstrate how these guidelines can be used to improve the performance of RDMA-based systems: we design a networked sequencer that outperforms an existing design by 50x, and improve the CPU efficiency of a prior high-performance key-value store by 83%. We also present and evaluate several new RDMA optimizations and pitfalls, and discuss how they affect the design of RDMA systems.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Anuj Kalia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalia:Anuj", "Michael Kaminsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaminsky:Michael", "David G.
