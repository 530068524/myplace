Upon retrieving records from multiple Web databases, a key task is to merge records that refer to the same real-world entity. We demonstrate ORLF (Online Record Linkage and Fusion), a flexible query-time record linkage and fusion framework. ORLF deduplicates newly arriving query results jointly with previously processed query results. We use an iterative caching solution that leverages query locality to effectively deduplicate newly incoming records with cached records. ORLF aims to deliver timely query answers that are duplicate-free and reflect knowledge collected from previous queries.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Temple University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["El Kindi Rezig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezig:El_Kindi", "Eduard C.
