Resultantly, there has recently been interest in developing designs that allow the service capacity to be dynamically resized to match the current workload. However, there is still much debate about the value of such approaches in real settings. In this paper, we show that the value of dynamic resizing is highly dependent on statistics of the workload process. In particular, both slow time-scale non-stationarities of the workload (e.g., the peak-to-mean ratio) and the fast time-scale stochasticity (e.g., the burstiness of arrivals) play key roles. To illustrate the impact of these factors, we combine optimization-based modeling of the slow time-scale with stochastic modeling of the fast time scale. Within this framework, we provide both analytic and numerical results characterizing when dynamic resizing does (and does not) provide benefits.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Facebook", "University of Warwick", "California Institute of Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Inst. of Softwa ...
