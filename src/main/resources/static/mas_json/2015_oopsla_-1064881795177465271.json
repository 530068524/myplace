EXPLORER allows users to formulate queries about feasible callstack configurations using regular expressions, and it employs a precise, demand-driven algorithm for answering such queries. Specifically, EXPLORER constructs an automaton A that is iteratively refined until either the language accepted by A is empty (meaning that the query has been refuted) or until no further refinement is possible based on a precise, context-sensitive abstraction of the program. We evaluate EXPLORER by applying it to three different program analysis tasks, namely, (1) analysis of the observer design pattern in Java, (2) identification of a class of performance bugs, and (3) analysis of inter-component communication in Android applications. Our evaluation shows that EXPLORER is both efficient and precise.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Yu Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Yu", "Xinyu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinyu", "Isil Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Isil", "Calvin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Calvin"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
