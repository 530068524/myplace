We investigate the use of non-speech sound in mobile interfaces and design a sonically-enhanced interface. The sonically-enhanced interface is compared to a visual interface when users are walking. The results show that the sonically-enhanced interface can improve the mobile interaction as compared to the visual interface.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Dalian Maritime University", "Dalian Maritime University"], "authors": ["Yaohua Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yaohua", "Zhengjie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhengjie"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
