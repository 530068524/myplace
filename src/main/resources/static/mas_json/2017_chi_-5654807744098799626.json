{"title": "Enabling Polyvocality in Interactive Documentaries through \"Structural Participation\".", "fields": ["interactivity", "co design", "sociotechnical system", "interactive media", "grassroots"], "abstract": "Recent innovations in online, social and interactive media have led to the emergence of new forms of documentary, such as interactive documentaries ('i-Docs'), with qualities that lend themselves to more open and inclusive production structures. Still, little is known about the experience of making and/or participating-in these kinds of documentary. Our two-year  in-the-wild  study engaged a large community-of-interest in the production of an i-Doc to explore the ethically-desirable yet challenging aim of enabling multiple subjects to have agency and control over their representation in a documentary. Our study reveals insights into the experiences of participating in an i-Doc and highlights key sociotechnical challenges. We argue that new sociotechnical infrastructure is needed, that frames both \"executory\" and \"structural\" forms of participation as symbiotic elements of a co-design process.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Northumbria University", "Newcastle University", "University of York", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David Philip Green.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Green:David_Philip", "Simon J.
