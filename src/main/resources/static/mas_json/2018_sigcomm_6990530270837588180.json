The design of p4v is based on classic verification techniques but adds several key innovations including a novel mechanism for incorporating assumptions about the control plane and domain-specific optimizations which are needed to scale to large programs. We present case studies showing that p4v verifies important properties and finds bugs in real-world programs. We conduct experiments to quantify the scalability of p4v on a wide range of additional examples. We show that with just a few hundred lines of control-plane annotations, p4v is able to verify critical safety properties for switch.p4, a program that implements the functionality of on a modern data center switch, in under three minutes.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Yale University", "Barefoot Networks", "Barefoot Networks", "Barefoot Networks", "Barefoot Networks"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Jed Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jed", "William Hallahan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hallahan:William", "Cole Schlesinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlesinger:Cole", "Milad Sharif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharif:Milad", "Jeongkeun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jeongkeun", "Robert Soul\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soul=eacute=:Robert", "Han Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Han", "Calin Cascaval.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cascaval:Calin", "Nick McKeown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McKeown:Nick", "Nate Foster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foster:Nate"], "pages": 14}
