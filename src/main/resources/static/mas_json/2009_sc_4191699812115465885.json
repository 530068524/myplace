{"title": "On the design of scalable, self-configuring virtual networks.", "fields": ["private network", "distributed data store", "addressability", "ip address management", "ip forwarding"], "abstract": "Virtual networks (VNs) provide methods that simplify resource management, deal with connectivity constraints, and support legacy applications in distributed systems, by enabling global addressability of VN-connected machines through either a common layer 2 Ethernet or a NAT-free layer 3 IP network. This paper presents a novel VN design that supports dynamic, seamless addition of new resources with emphasis on scalability in a unified private IP address space. Key features of this system are: (1) Scalable connectivity via a P2P overlay with the ability to bypass overlay routing in LAN communications, (2) support for static and dynamic address allocation in conjunction with virtual nameservers through a distributed data store, and (3) support for transparent migration of IP endpoints across widearea networks.   The approach is validated by a prototype implementation which has been deployed in grid and cloud environments. We present both a quantitative and qualitative discussion of our findings.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["David Isaac Wolinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolinsky:David_Isaac", "Yonggang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yonggang", "Pierre St. Juste.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juste:Pierre_St=", "Girish Venkatasubramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkatasubramanian:Girish", "Renato J.
