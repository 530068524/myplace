{"title": "Using stop-and-wait to improve TCP throughput in fast optical switching (FOS) networks over short physical distances.", "fields": ["tcp global synchronization", "optical burst switching", "cubic tcp", "fast packet switching", "tcp westwood plus"], "abstract": "Due to lack of optical RAM buffers in fast optical switches (FOS), statistical multiplexing technologies using FOS like Optical Burst Switching (OBS) or Optical Packet Switching (OPS) are expected to have higher data losses than conventional electronic networks. Consequently, applications transferring data by means of TCP can suffer from a lower throughput. In this paper, we show that this low-throughput problem is mainly an artifact caused by the conventional TCP congestion control algorithms, and can be remedied by using a simple yet effective stop-and-wait congestion control algorithm instead, as long as the propagation delay between TCP source and TCP destination is small compared to the transmission time of an optical packet. We show that such a condition holds for a wide range of scenarios, including fat-tree-based data center networks. We also show that the throughput achieved in a FOS network using stop-and- wait can be the same as, or higher than that in an equivalent, conventional electronic network. I.
