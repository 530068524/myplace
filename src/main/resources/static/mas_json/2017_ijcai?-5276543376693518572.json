We propose a novel approach to producing justifications that is geared towards users without machine learning expertise, focusing on domain knowledge and on human reasoning, and utilizing natural language generation. Through a task-based experiment, we show that our approach significantly helps humans to correctly decide whether or not predictions are accurate, and significantly increases their satisfaction with the justification.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "n-Join"], "authors": ["Or Biran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biran:Or", "Kathleen R.
