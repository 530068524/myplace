Motivated by recent hardware trends, in this paper we present two novel solutions for computing set-containment joins over massive sets: the Patricia Trie-based Signature Join (PTSJ) and PRETTI+, a Patricia trie enhanced extension of the state-of-the-art PRETTI join. The compact trie structure not only enables efficient use of main-memory, but also significantly boosts the performance of both approaches. By carefully analyzing the algorithms and conducting extensive experiments with various synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that, in many practical cases, our algorithms are an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "authors": ["Yongming Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Yongming", "George H.
