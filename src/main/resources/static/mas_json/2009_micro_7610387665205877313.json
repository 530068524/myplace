{"title": "Coordinated control of multiple prefetchers in multi-core systems.", "fields": ["bandwidth throttling", "instruction prefetch", "cas latency", "multi core processor", "multiprocessing"], "abstract": "Aggressive prefetching is very beneficial for memory latency tolerance of many applications. However, it faces significant challenges in multi-core systems. Prefetchers of different cores on a chip multiprocessor (CMP) can cause significant interference with prefetch and demand accesses of other cores. Because existing prefetcher throttling techniques do not address this prefetcher-caused inter-core interference, aggressive prefetching in multi-core systems can lead to significant performance degradation and wasted bandwidth consumption.   To make prefetching effective in CMPs, this paper proposes a low-cost mechanism to control prefetcher-caused inter-core interference by dynamically adjusting the aggressiveness of multiple cores' prefetchers in a coordinated fashion. Our solution consists of a hierarchy of prefetcher aggressiveness control structures that combine per-core (local) and prefetcher-caused inter-core (global) interference feedback to maximize the benefits of prefetching on each core while optimizing overall system performance. These structures improve system performance by 23% while reducing bus traffic by 17% compared to employing aggressive prefetching and improve system performance by 14% compared to a state-of-the-art prefetcher aggressiveness control technique on an eight-core system.", "citation": "Citations (155)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Eiman Ebrahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ebrahimi:Eiman", "Onur Mutlu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mutlu:Onur", "Chang Joo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chang_Joo", "Yale N.
