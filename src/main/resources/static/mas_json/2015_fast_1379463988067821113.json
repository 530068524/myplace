{"title": "NV-Tree: Reducing Consistency Cost for NVM-based Single Level Systems.", "fields": ["nvdimm", "data consistency", "throughput", "memory controller", "tree structure"], "abstract": "The non-volatile memory (NVM) has DRAM-like performance and disk-like persistency which make it possible to replace both disk and DRAM to build single level systems. To keep data consistency in such systems is non-trivial because memory writes may be reordered by CPU and memory controller. In this paper, we study the consistency cost for an important and common data structure, B+Tree. Although the memory fence and CPU cacheline flush instructions can order memory writes to achieve data consistency, they introduce a significant overhead (more than 10X slower in performance). Based on our quantitative analysis of consistency cost, we propose NV-Tree, a consistent and cache-optimized B+Tree variant with reduced CPU cacheline flush. We implement and evaluate NV-Tree and NV-Store, a key-value store based on NV-Tree, on an NVDIMM server. NV-Tree outperforms the state-of-art consistent tree structures by up to 12X under write-intensive workloads. NV-Store increases the throughput by up to 4.8X under YCSB workloads compared to Redis.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["Data Storage Institute", "Data Storage Institute", "Data Storage Institute", "Data Storage Institute", "Data Storage Institute"], "authors": ["Jun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jun", "Qingsong Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Qingsong", "Cheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0008:Cheng", "Chundong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Chundong", "Khai Leong Yong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yong:Khai_Leong", "Bingsheng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Bingsheng"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
