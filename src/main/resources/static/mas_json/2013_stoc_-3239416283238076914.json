We show that an algorithmic interpretation may also be given for a noncommutative generalization of the Grothendieck inequality due to Pisier and Haagerup. Our main result, an efficient rounding procedure for this inequality, leads to a constant-factor polynomial time approximation algorithm for an optimization problem which generalizes the Cut Norm problem of Frieze and Kannan, and is shown here to have additional applications to robust principle component analysis and the orthogonal Procrustes problem.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "New York University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Assaf Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Assaf", "Oded Regev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regev_0001:Oded", "Thomas Vidick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidick:Thomas"], "pages": 10}
