{"title": "On sample-path optimal dynamic scheduling for sum-queue minimization in trees under the K-hop interference model.", "fields": ["tree traversal", "dynamic priority scheduling", "queue", "tree structure", "sink", "hop"], "abstract": "We investigate the problem of minimizing the sum of the queue lengths of all the nodes in a wireless network with a tree topology. Nodes send their packets to the tree's root (sink). We consider a time-slotted system and a   $K$  -hop interference model. We characterize the existence of causal sample-path optimal scheduling policies in these networks, i.e., we wish to find a policy such that at each time-slot, for any traffic arrival pattern, the sum of the queue lengths of all the nodes is minimum among all policies. We provide an algorithm that takes any tree and   $K$   as inputs, and outputs whether a causal sample-path optimal policy exists for this tree under the   $K$  -hop interference model. We show that when this algorithm returns FALSE, there exists a traffic arrival pattern for which no causal sample-path optimal policy exists for the given tree structure. We further show that for certain tree structures, even noncausal sample-path optimal policies do not exist. We provide causal sample-path optimal policies for those tree structures for which the algorithm returns TRUE. Thus, we completely characterize the existence of such policies for all trees under the    $K$  -hop interference model. The nonexistence of sample-path optimal policies in a large class of tree structures implies that we need to study other (relatively) weaker metrics for this problem.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["AT&T Labs", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Srikanth Hariharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hariharan:Srikanth", "Ness B.
