{"title": "BatchRank: A Novel Batch Mode Active Learning Framework for Hierarchical Classification.", "fields": ["arntl", "power iteration", "active learning", "batch processing", "granularity"], "abstract": "Active learning algorithms automatically identify the salient and exemplar instances from large amounts of unlabeled data and thus reduce human annotation effort in inducing a classification model. More recently, Batch Mode Active Learning (BMAL) techniques have been proposed, where a batch of data samples is selected simultaneously from an unlabeled set. Most active learning algorithms assume a flat label space, that is, they consider the class labels to be independent. However, in many applications, the set of class labels are organized in a hierarchical tree structure, with the leaf nodes as outputs and the internal nodes as clusters of outputs at multiple levels of granularity. In this paper, we propose a novel BMAL algorithm (BatchRank) for hierarchical classification. The sample selection is posed as an NP-hard integer quadratic programming problem and a convex relaxation (based on linear programming) is derived, whose solution is further improved by an iterative truncated power method. Finally, a deterministic bound is established on the quality of the solution. Our empirical results on several challenging, real-world datasets from multiple domains, corroborate the potential of the proposed framework for real-world hierarchical classification applications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad", "Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad", "Arizona State University", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Shayok Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty:Shayok", "Vineeth Nallure Balasubramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balasubramanian:Vineeth_Nallure", "Adepu Ravi Sankar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankar:Adepu_Ravi", "Sethuraman Panchanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panchanathan:Sethuraman", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
