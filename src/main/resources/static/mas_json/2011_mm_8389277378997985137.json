Another unique feature of DISPAC, lies in the parallelizability of the modules used by its WZ decoder which increased the decoding speed largely. Experimental results conducted on an emulated Could computing environment reveal that DISPAC codec can gain up to 3.6 dB in the RD measures and 60.97 times faster in the decoding speed as compared with the-state-of-art WZ video codec, respectively", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Han-Ping Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Han=Ping", "Yun-Chung Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yun=Chung", "Ja-Ling Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ja=Ling", "Kiyoharu Aizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aizawa:Kiyoharu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
