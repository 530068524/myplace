Network reservation systems such as ESnet's OSCARS, establish guaranteed bandwidth of secure virtual circuits for a certain bandwidth and length of time. However, users currently cannot inquire about bandwidth availability, nor have alternative suggestions when reservation requests fail. In general, the number of reservation options is exponential with the number of nodes n, and current reservation commitments. We present a novel approach for path finding in time-dependent networks taking advantage of user-provided parameters of total volume and time constraints, which produces options for earliest completion and shortest duration. The theoretical complexity is only O(n2r2) in the worst-case, where r is the number of reservations in the desired time interval. We have implemented our algorithm and developed efficient methodologies for incorporation into network reservation frameworks. Performance measurements confirm the theoretical predictions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Mehmet Balman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balman:Mehmet", "Evangelos Chaniotakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaniotakis:Evangelos", "Arie Shoshani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shoshani:Arie", "Alex Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Alex"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2010", "pages": 11}
