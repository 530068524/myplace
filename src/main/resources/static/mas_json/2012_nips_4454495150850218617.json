{"title": "Bandit Algorithms boost Brain Computer Interfaces for motor-task selection of a brain-controlled button.", "fields": ["brain computer interface", "machine learning", "algorithm", "artificial intelligence", "adaptive algorithm"], "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) allow users to ''communicate'' with a computer without using their muscles. BCI based on sensori-motor rhythms use imaginary motor tasks, such as moving the right or left hand, to send control signals. The performances of a BCI can vary greatly across users but also depend on the tasks used, making the problem of appropriate task selection an important issue. This study presents a new procedure to automatically select as fast as possible a discriminant motor task for a brain-controlled button. We develop for this purpose an adaptive algorithm, \\textit{UCB-classif}, based on the stochastic bandit theory. This shortens the training stage, thereby allowing the exploration of a greater variety of tasks. By not wasting time on inefficient tasks, and focusing on the most promising ones, this algorithm results in a faster task selection and a more efficient use of the BCI training session. Comparing the proposed method to the standard practice in task selection, for a fixed time budget, \\textit{UCB-classif} leads to an improved classification rate, and for a fixed classification rate, to a reduction of the time spent in training by $50\\%$.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Cambridge", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Joan Fruitet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fruitet:Joan", "Alexandra Carpentier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carpentier:Alexandra", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi", "Maureen Clerc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clerc:Maureen"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
