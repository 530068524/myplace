{"title": "Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Processes: A Semiparametric Regression Approach for Discovering Latent Task Parametrizations.", "fields": ["semiparametric regression", "pattern recognition", "dynamical systems theory", "markov decision process", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Control applications often feature tasks with similar, but not identical, dynamics. We introduce the Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process (HiP-MDP), a framework that parametrizes a family of related dynamical systems with a low-dimensional set of latent factors, and introduce a semiparametric regression approach for learning its structure from data. We show that a learned HiP-MDP rapidly identifies the dynamics of new task instances in several settings, flexibly adapting to task variation.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Duke University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Finale Doshi-Velez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doshi=Velez:Finale", "George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George"], "pages": 9}
