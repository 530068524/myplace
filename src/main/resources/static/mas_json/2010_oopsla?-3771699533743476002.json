Tribal Ownership is based on Tribe, a language with nested classes and object families. In Tribal Ownership, a program's runtime object ownership structure is characterised by the lexical nesting structure of its classes.   We build on a variant of Tribe to present a  descriptive  ownership system, using object nesting to describe heap partitions, but without imposing any restrictions on programming disciplines. We then demonstrate how a range of different  prescriptive ownership policies  can be supported on top of the descriptive Tribal Ownership mechanism; including a novel  owners-as-local-dominators  policy. We formalise our type system and prove soundness and several ownership invariants. The resulting system requires strikingly few annotations, and uses well-understood encapsulation techniques to create ownership systems that should be intuitive for programmers.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Victoria University of Wellington", "Victoria University of Wellington", "Uppsala University"], "authors": ["Nicholas Robert Cameron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cameron:Nicholas_Robert", "James Noble.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noble_0001:James", "Tobias Wrigstad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wrigstad:Tobias"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2010", "pages": 16}
