{"title": "Visibility Based Preconditioning for bundle adjustment.", "fields": ["bundle adjustment", "symmetric matrix", "cluster analysis", "linear least squares", "visibility"], "abstract": "We present Visibility Based Preconditioning (VBP) a new technique for efficiently solving the linear least squares problems that arise in bundle adjustment [24]. Using the camera-point visibility structure of the scene, we describe the construction of two preconditioners. These preconditioners when combined with an inexact step Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm[25] offer state of the art performance on the BAL data set [1], with 3\u20135\u00d7 reduction in execution time over currently available methods while delivering comparable or better solution quality.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Google"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Avanish Kushal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kushal:Avanish", "Sameer Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Sameer"], "pages": 8}
