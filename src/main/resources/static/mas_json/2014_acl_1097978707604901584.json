However, previous work uses only the source language and completely ignores the target language, which can disambiguate domains. We propose new polylingual tree-based topic models to extract domain knowledge that considers both source and target languages and derive three different inference schemes. We evaluate our model on a Chinese to English translation task and obtain up to 1.2 BLEU improvement over strong baselines.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yuening Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yuening", "Ke Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai_0001:Ke", "Vladimir Eidelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eidelman:Vladimir", "Jordan L.
