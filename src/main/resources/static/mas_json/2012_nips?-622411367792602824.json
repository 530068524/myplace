{"title": "Learning Mixtures of Tree Graphical Models.", "fields": ["bounded function", "spectral method", "graph", "class variable", "graphical model"], "abstract": "We consider unsupervised estimation of mixtures of discrete graphical models, where the class variable is hidden and each mixture component can have a potentially different Markov graph structure and parameters over the observed variables. We propose a novel method for estimating the mixture components with provable guarantees. Our output is a tree-mixture model which serves as a good approximation to the underlying graphical model mixture. The sample and computational requirements for our method scale as poly(p, r), for an r-component mixture of p-variate graphical models, for a wide class of models which includes tree mixtures and mixtures over bounded degree graphs.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Animashree Anandkumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anandkumar:Animashree", "Daniel J.
