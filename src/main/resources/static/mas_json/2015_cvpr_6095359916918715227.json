{"title": "Simplified mirror-based camera pose computation via rotation averaging.", "fields": ["chordal graph", "camera resectioning", "planar", "camera auto calibration", "3d pose estimation"], "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to compute the camera pose with respect to a reference object given only mirrored views. The latter originate from a planar mirror at different unknown poses. This problem is highly relevant in several extrinsic camera calibration scenarios, where the camera cannot see the reference object directly. In contrast to numerous existing methods, our approach does not employ the fixed axis rotation constraint, but represents a more elegant formulation as a rotation averaging problem. Our theoretical contribution extends the applicability of rotation averaging to a more general case, and enables mirror-based pose estimation in closed-form under the chordal L2-metric, or in an outlier-robust way by employing iterative L1-norm averaging. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on both synthetic and real data, and show how the method can be applied to calibrate the non-overlapping pair of cameras of a common smart phone.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "Australian National University", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Gucan Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Gucan", "Laurent Kneip.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kneip:Laurent", "Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xin", "Xiaohu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiaohu", "Qifeng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Qifeng"], "pages": 9}
