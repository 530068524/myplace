In particular, we avoid growing polynomially with the maximum space of a computation. Our construction is based on iO for circuits, one way functions and injective pseudo random generators.   Our results are based on new \"selective enforcement\" techniques. Here we first create a primitive called positional accumulators that allows for a small commitment to a much larger storage. The commitment is unconditionally sound for a select piece of the storage. This primitive serves as an \"iO-friendly\" tool that allows us to make two different programs equivalent at different stages of a proof. The pieces of storage that are selected depend on what hybrid stage we are at in a proof.   We first build up our enforcement ideas in a simpler context of \"message hiding encodings\" and work our way up to indistinguishability obfuscation.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Columbia University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Venkata Koppula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koppula:Venkata", "Allison Bishop Lewko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lewko:Allison_Bishop", "Brent Waters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waters:Brent"], "pages": 10}
