In this paper, aiming at providing accurate personalized Web site recommendations for Web users, we propose a novel probabilistic factor model based on dimensionality reduction techniques. We also extend the proposed method to collective probabilistic factor modeling, which further improves model performance by incorporating heterogeneous data sources. The proposed method is general, and can be applied to not only Web site recommendations, but also a wide range of Web applications, including behavioral targeting, sponsored search, etc. The experimental analysis on Web site recommendation shows that our method outperforms other traditional recommendation approaches. Moreover, the complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Hao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Hao", "Chao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chao", "Irwin King.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King:Irwin", "Michael R.
