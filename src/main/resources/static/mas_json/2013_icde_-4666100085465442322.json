{"title": "ExpFinder: Finding experts by graph pattern matching.", "fields": ["graph", "moral graph", "graph rewriting", "graph database", "graph operations"], "abstract": "We present ExpFinder, a system for finding experts in social networks based on graph pattern matching. We demonstrate (1) how ExpFinder identifies top-K experts in a social network by supporting bounded simulation of graph patterns, and by ranking the matches based on a metric for social impact; (2) how it copes with the sheer size of real-life social graphs by supporting incremental query evaluation and query preserving graph compression, and (3) how the GUI of ExpFinder interacts with users to help them construct queries and inspect matches.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Wenfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wenfei", "Xin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xin", "Yinghui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yinghui"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
