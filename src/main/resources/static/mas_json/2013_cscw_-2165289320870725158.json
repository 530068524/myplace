{"title": "Contributor profiles, their dynamics, and their importance in five q&a sites.", "fields": ["empirical research", "computer science", "longitudinal study", "data mining"], "abstract": "Q&A sites currently enable large numbers of contributors to collectively build valuable knowledge bases. Naturally, these sites are the product of contributors acting in different ways - creating questions, answers or comments and voting in these - contributing in diverse amounts, and creating content of varying quality. This paper advances present knowledge about Q&A sites using a multifaceted view of contributors that accounts for diversity of behavior, motivation and expertise to characterize their profiles in five sites. This characterization resulted in the definition of ten behavioral profiles that group users according to the quality and quantity of their contributions. Using these profiles, we find that the five sites have remarkably similar distributions of contributor profiles. We also conduct a longitudinal study of contributor profiles in one of the sites, identifying common profile transitions, and finding that although users change profiles with some frequency, the site composition is mostly stable over time.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Federal University of Campina Grande", "Federal University of Campina Grande", "Federal University of Campina Grande", "Federal University of Campina Grande"], "authors": ["Adabriand Furtado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furtado:Adabriand", "Nazareno Andrade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrade:Nazareno", "Nigini Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:Nigini", "Francisco Vilar Brasileiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brasileiro:Francisco_Vilar"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 16}
