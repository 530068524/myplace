We focus on possible and necessary allocation problems, checking whether allocations of a given form occur in some or all mechanisms for several commonly used classes of sequential allocation mechanisms. In particular, we consider whether a given agent receives a given item, a set of items, or a subset of items for natural classes of sequential allocation mechanisms: balanced, recursively balanced, balanced alternation, and strict alternation. We present characterizations of the allocations that result respectively from the classes, which extend the well-known characterization by Brams and King [2005] for policies without restrictions. In addition, we examine the computational complexity of possible and necessary allocation problems for these classes.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["NICTA", "NICTA", "RPI, NY"], "authors": ["Haris Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz_0001:Haris", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby", "Lirong Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Lirong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
