This method enjoys the benefits of two novel techniques. The first one is semantic transfer (ST), which is: (1) a formulation to integrate the relationship between scene clutter and room layout into convolutional neural networks, (2) an architecture that can be end-to-end trained, (3) a practical strategy to initialize weights for very deep networks under unbalanced training data distribution. ST allows us to extract highly robust features under various circumstances, and in order to address the computation redundance hidden in these features we develop a principled and efficient inference scheme named physics inspired optimization (PIO). PIOs basic idea is to formulate some phenomena observed in ST features into mechanics concepts. Evaluations on public datasets LSUN and Hedau show that the proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hao Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Hao", "Ming Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Ming", "Anbang Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Anbang", "Yiwen Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yiwen", "Yurong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yurong", "Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Li"], "pages": 9}
