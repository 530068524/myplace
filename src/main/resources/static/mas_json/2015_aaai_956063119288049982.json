Rather than fitting two Markov networks separately to two sets of data and figuring out their differences, a recent work proposed to learn changes directly via estimating the ratio between two Markov network models. Such a direct approach was demonstrated to perform excellently in experiments, although its theoretical properties remained unexplored. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions for successful change detection with respect to the sample size np,nq, the dimension of data m, and the number of changed edges d. More specifically, we prove that the true sparse changes can be consistently identified for np = \u03a9(d2 log m2+ m/2) and nq = \u03a9(n2p/d), with an exponentially decaying upper-bound on learning error. Our theoretical guarantee can be applied to a wide range of discrete/continuous Markov networks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Song Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Song", "Taiji Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Taiji", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
