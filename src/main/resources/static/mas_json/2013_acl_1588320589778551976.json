{"title": "Word Association Profiles and their Use for Automated Scoring of Essays.", "fields": ["speech recognition", "target audience", "word association", "vocabulary", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We describe a new representation of the content vocabulary of a text we call word association profile that captures the proportions of highly associated, mildly associated, unassociated, and dis-associated pairs of words that co-exist in the given text. We illustrate the shape of the distirbution and observe variation with genre and target audience. We present a study of the relationship between quality of writing and word association profiles. For a set of essays written by college graduates on a number of general topics, we show that the higher scoring essays tend to have higher percentages of both highly associated and dis-associated pairs, and lower percentages of mildly associated pairs of words. Finally, we use word association profiles to improve a system for automated scoring of essays.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Educational Testing Service", "Educational Testing Service"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Beata Beigman Klebanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klebanov:Beata_Beigman", "Michael Flor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flor:Michael"], "pages": 11}
