{"title": "A Full Characterization of Completeness for Two-Party Randomized Function Evaluation.", "fields": ["oblivious transfer", "completeness", "circuit complexity", "open problem", "statistics", "computation", "mathematics"], "abstract": "We settle a long standing open problem which has pursued a full characterization of completeness of (potentially randomized) finite functions for 2-party computation that is secure against active adversaries. Since the first such complete function was discovered [Kilian, FOCS 1988], the question of which finite 2-party functions are complete has been studied extensively, leading to characterization in many special cases. In this work, we completely settle this problem.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "Los Angeles, USA"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Daniel Kraschewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraschewski:Daniel", "Hemanta K.
