The technical advancements of the commercial mobile phones make them capable of supporting such requirements under very disruptive network conditions. In this demo, we present a network architecture that exploits partial caches by utilizing network coding to deliver large files (e.g. images) to first responders. The architecture is based on a content centric network platform called ICEMAN(Information CEntric Mobile Ad-hoc Networking) and runs on Android phones. We demonstrate our system in a file dissemination scenario in a CORE/EMANE network emulation. We measure file delivery ratio, latency, and network overhead and report significant improvements that network coding achieves over fragmentation.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Suns-Tech, Santa Cruz, CA, USA", "Suns-Tech, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Joshua Joy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joy:Joshua", "Yu-Ting Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yu=Ting", "Mario Gerla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerla:Mario", "Samuel B.
