On the K computer, GAMERA was able to achieve a size-up efficiency of 87.1% up to the full K computer. Next, we applied GAMERA to a physics-based urban earthquake response analysis for Tokyo. Using 294,912 CPU cores of the K computer for 11 h, 32 min, we analyzed the 3-D non-linear ground motion of a 10.7 BlnDOF problem with 30 K time steps. Finally, we analyzed the stochastic response of 13,275 building structures in the domain considering uncertainty in structural parameters using 3 h, 56 min of 80,000 CPU cores of the K computer. Although a large amount of computer resources is needed presently, such analyses can change the quality of disaster estimations and are expected to become standard in the future.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Tsuyoshi Ichimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ichimura:Tsuyoshi", "Kohei Fujita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujita:Kohei", "Seizo Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Seizo", "Muneo Hori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hori:Muneo", "Wijerathne Maddegedara Lalith Lakshman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lakshman:Wijerathne_Maddegedara_Lalith", "Yoshihisa Shizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shizawa:Yoshihisa", "Hiroshi Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Hiroshi"], "pages": 12}
