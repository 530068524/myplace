{"title": "Benders Decomposition for Large-Scale Prescriptive Evacuations.", "fields": ["benders decomposition", "computer science", "simulation"], "abstract": "This paper considers prescriptive evacuation planning for a region threatened by a natural disaster such a flood, a wildfire, or a hurricane. It proposes a Benders decomposition that generalizes the two-stage approach proposed in earlier work for convergent evacuation plans. Experimental results show that Benders decomposition provides significant improvements in solution quality in reasonable time: It finds provably optimal solutions to scenarios considered in prior work, closing these instances, and increases the number of evacuees by 10 to 15% on average on more complex flood scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Brown University", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Julia Romanski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romanski:Julia", "Pascal Van Hentenryck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hentenryck:Pascal_Van"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
