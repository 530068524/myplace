Cooperation is feasible only if the system's performance is improved over the non-cooperative case. First, we investigate a scenario where secondary users are interested in immediate rewards. Then, we formulate another problem where the secondary users are guaranteed a portion of the primary utility, on a long term basis, in return for cooperation. In both scenarios, our proposed schemes are shown to outperform non-cooperative scheduling schemes, in terms of both individual and total expected utility, for a given set of feasible constraints. Based on Lyapunov Optimization techniques, we show that our schemes are arbitrarily close to the optimal performance at the price of reduced convergence rate.", "citation": "Citations (40)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Sabanc\u0131 University", "Sabanc\u0131 University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Karim Khalil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khalil:Karim", "Mehmet Karaca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karaca_0001:Mehmet", "\u00d6zg\u00fcr Er\u00e7etin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Er=ccedil=etin:=Ouml=zg=uuml=r", "Eylem Ekici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ekici:Eylem"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
