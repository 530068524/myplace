{"title": "Sparse Random Feature Algorithm as Coordinate Descent in Hilbert Space.", "fields": ["kernel", "coordinate descent", "solver", "boosting", "kernel method"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Sparse Random Features algorithm, which learns a sparse non-linear predictor by minimizing an l1-regularized objective function over the Hilbert Space induced from a kernel function. By interpreting the algorithm as Randomized Coordinate Descent in an infinite-dimensional space, we show the proposed approach converges to a solution within \u220a-precision of that using an exact kernel method, by drawing O(1/\u220a) random features, in contrast to the O(1/\u220a2) convergence achieved by current Monte-Carlo analyses of Random Features. In our experiments, the Sparse Random Feature algorithm obtains a sparse solution that requires less memory and prediction time, while maintaining comparable performance on regression and classification tasks. Moreover, as an approximate solver for the infinite-dimensional l1-regularized problem, the randomized approach also enjoys better convergence guarantees than a Boosting approach in the setting where the greedy Boosting step cannot be performed exactly.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ian En-Hsu Yen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yen:Ian_En=Hsu", "Ting-Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Ting=Wei", "Shou-De Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shou=De", "Pradeep Ravikumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravikumar:Pradeep", "Inderjit S.
