{"title": "Time for Statistical Model Checking of Real-Time Systems.", "fields": ["hybrid automaton", "undecidable problem", "correctness", "user interface", "semantics"], "abstract": "We propose the first tool for solving complex (some undecidable) problems of timed systems by using Statistical Model Checking (SMC). The tool monitors several runs of the system, and then relies on statistical algorithms to get an estimate of the correctness of the entire design. Contrary to other existing toolsets, ours relies on i) a natural stochastic semantics for networks of timed systems, ii) an engine capable to solve problems that are beyond the scope of classical model checkers, and iii) a friendly user interface.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Aalborg University", "East China Normal University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Alexandre David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/David:Alexandre", "Kim G.
