{"title": "Minimized Models and Grammar-Informed Initialization for Supertagging with Highly Ambiguous Lexicons.", "fields": ["minification", "initialization", "grammar", "ambiguity", "minimal model"], "abstract": "We combine two complementary ideas for learning supertaggers from highly ambiguous lexicons: grammar-informed tag transitions and models minimized via integer programming. Each strategy on its own greatly improves performance over basic expectation-maximization training with a bitag Hidden Markov Model, which we show on the CCGbank and CCG-TUT corpora. The strategies provide further error reductions when combined. We describe a new two-stage integer programming strategy that efficiently deals with the high degree of ambiguity on these datasets while obtaining the full effect of model minimization.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sujith Ravi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravi:Sujith", "Jason Baldridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldridge:Jason", "Kevin Knight.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knight:Kevin"], "pages": 9}
