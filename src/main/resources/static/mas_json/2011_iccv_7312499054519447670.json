We present a new, single image approach to reconstructing thin transparent surfaces, such as thin solids or surfaces of fluids. Our method is based on observing the distortion of light field background illumination. Light field probes have the potential to encode up to four dimensions in varying colors and intensities: spatial and angular variation on the probe surface; commonly employed reference patterns are only two-dimensional by coding either position or angle on the probe. We show that the additional information can be used to reconstruct refractive surface normals and a sparse set of control points from a single photograph.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Gordon Wetzstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wetzstein:Gordon", "David Roodnick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roodnick:David", "Wolfgang Heidrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heidrich:Wolfgang", "Ramesh Raskar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raskar:Ramesh"], "pages": 7}
