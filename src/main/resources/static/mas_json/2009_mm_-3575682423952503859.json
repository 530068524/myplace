Unlike current techniques such as video compression and summarization which are still struggling to achieve the two often conflicting goals of low storage and high visual and semantic fidelity, NLVS is able to summarize a video stream with least information loss by using an extremely small piece of metadata. Although at a very low compression ratio (1/30 of H.264 baseline in average, where traditional compression techniques like H.264 fail to preserve the fidelity), the summary still can be used to reconstruct the original video (with the same duration) nearly without semantic information loss.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Lin-Xie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Lin=Xie", "Tao Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Tao", "Xian-Sheng Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Xian=Sheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
