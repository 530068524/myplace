{"title": "Beyond Triangles: A Distributed Framework for Estimating 3-profiles of Large Graphs.", "fields": ["butterfly graph", "windmill graph", "graph factorization", "factor critical graph", "loop"], "abstract": "We study the problem of approximating the 3-profile of a large graph. 3-profiles are generalizations of triangle counts that specify the number of times a small graph appears as an induced subgraph of a large graph. Our algorithm uses the novel concept of 3-profile sparsifiers: sparse graphs that can be used to approximate the full 3-profile counts for a given large graph. Further, we study the problem of estimating local and ego 3-profiles, two graph quantities that characterize the local neighborhood of each vertex of a graph.   Our algorithm is distributed and operates as a vertex program over the GraphLab PowerGraph framework. We introduce the concept of edge pivoting which allows us to collect 2-hop information without maintaining an explicit 2-hop neighborhood list at each vertex. This enables the computation of all the local 3-profiles in parallel with minimal communication.   We test our implementation in several experiments scaling up to 640 cores on Amazon EC2. We find that our algorithm can estimate the 3-profile of a graph in approximately the same time as triangle counting. For the harder problem of ego 3-profiles, we introduce an algorithm that can estimate profiles of hundreds of thousands of vertices in parallel, in the timescale of minutes.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Ethan R.
