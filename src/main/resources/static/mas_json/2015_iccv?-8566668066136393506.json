{"title": "Introducing Geometry in Active Learning for Image Segmentation.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "automatic image annotation", "region growing", "feature detection", "minimum spanning tree based segmentation"], "abstract": "We propose an Active Learning approach to training a segmentation classifier that exploits geometric priors to streamline the annotation process in 3D image volumes. To this end, we use these priors not only to select voxels most in need of annotation but to guarantee that they lie on 2D planar patch, which makes it much easier to annotate than if they were randomly distributed in the volume. A simplified version of this approach is effective in natural 2D images. We evaluated our approach on Electron Microscopy and Magnetic Resonance image volumes, as well as on natural images. Comparing our approach against several accepted baselines demonstrates a marked performance increase.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Bern", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ksenia Konyushkova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konyushkova:Ksenia", "Raphael Sznitman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sznitman:Raphael", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal"], "pages": 9}
