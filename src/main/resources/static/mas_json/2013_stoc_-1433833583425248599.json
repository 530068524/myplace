We give a new proof of the Majority is Stablest Theorem by induction on the dimension of the discrete cube. Unlike the previous proof, it uses neither the \"invariance principle\" nor Borell's result in Gaussian space. The new proof is general enough to include all previous variants of majority is stablest such as \"it ain't over until it's over\" and \"Majority is most predictable\". Moreover, the new proof allows us to derive a proof of Majority is Stablest in a constant level of the Sum of Squares hierarchy. This implies in particular that Khot-Vishnoi instance of Max-Cut does not provide a gap instance for the Lasserre hierarchy.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin", "Electrical Engi ... omputer Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anindya De.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/De:Anindya", "Elchanan Mossel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mossel:Elchanan", "Joe Neeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neeman:Joe"], "pages": 10}
