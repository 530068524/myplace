{"title": "Shallow-Low-Light Trees, and Tight Lower Bounds for Euclidean Spanners.", "fields": ["integer", "binary logarithm", "euclidean space", "metric space", "spanning tree"], "abstract": "We show that for every n-point metric space M and positive integer k, there exists a spanning tree T with unweighted diameter O(k) and weight w(T) = O(k ldr n 1/k )  ldr  w(MST(M)), and a spanning tree T' with weight w(T') = O(k)  ldr  w(MST(M)) and unweighted diameter O(k ldr n 1/k ). Moreover, there is a designated point rt such that for every other point v, both dist T (rt, v) and dist T (rt, v) are at most (1 + epsiv)  ldr  dist M (rt,v), for an arbitrarily small constant epsiv > 0. We prove that the above tradeoffs are tight up to constant factors in the entire range of parameters. Furthermore, our lower bounds apply to a basic one-dimensional Euclidean space. Finally, our lower bounds for the particular case of unweighted diameter O(log n) settle a long-standing open problem in Computational Geometry.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Yefim Dinitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinitz:Yefim", "Michael Elkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkin:Michael", "Shay Solomon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solomon:Shay"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
