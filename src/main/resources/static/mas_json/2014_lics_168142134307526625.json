{"title": "Weak MSO: automata and expressiveness modulo bisimilarity.", "fields": ["generalized quantifier", "branching", "modulo", "monad", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "expressivity"], "abstract": "We prove that the bisimulation-invariant fragment of weak monadic second-order logic (WMSO) is equivalent to the fragment of the modal  \u03bc -calculus where the application of the least fixpoint operator  \u03bcp .\u03c6 is restricted to formulas \u03c6 that are continuous in  p . Our proof is automata-theoretic in nature; in particular, we introduce a class of automata characterizing the expressive power of WMSO over tree models of arbitrary branching degree. The transition map of these automata is defined in terms of a logic FOE 1  \u221e  that is the extension of first-order logic with a generalized quantifier \u2203 \u221e , where \u2203 \u221e  x .\u03c6 means that there are infinitely many objects satisfying \u03c6. An important part of our work consists of a model-theoretic analysis of FOE 1  \u221e .", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "U. Amsterdam", "U.
