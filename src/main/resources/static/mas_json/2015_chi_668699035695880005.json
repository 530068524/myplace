{"title": "Contextual Influences on the Use and Non-Use of Digital Technology While Exercising at the Gym.", "fields": ["wearable computer", "informatics", "activity tracker", "situated", "wearable technology", "distraction"], "abstract": "The use of wearable technology will become significantly more prevalent in the coming years, with major companies releasing devices such as the Samsung Gear Fit. With sensors, such as pedometers and heart rate monitors, embedded in these devices it is possible to use them for fitness purposes. However, little is known about how wearable adopters actually use wearable and existing technologies during exercise. In an exploratory situated study of technology use and non-use in the context of the gym, fitness informatics adopters showed varied practices related to distraction, appropriating technology into their routines, and information needs. We discuss this variance in relation to individual differences and the impact of the physical nature of the gym. Although further research might show other influencing factors such as the social context, we make a case for the use of situated studies to uncover tensions that lead to use and non-use of technology that arise in the different unfolding situations of using wearables in everyday life, including at the gym, which is a surprisingly complex context.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Misha Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Misha", "Aisling Ann O'Kane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Kane:Aisling_Ann"], "pages": 10}
