In this paper, we propose an environmental sound and auditory scene recognition scheme that focuses on efficient feature representation and classfication of the unstructured composition of a scene (for example, restaurant, street, beach, etc.). We propose to use the local discriminant bases (LDB) technique to identify the discriminatory time-frequency subspace for environmental sounds and then use it for corresponding feature extraction. Based on LDB, we present two recognition models, with or without explicit sound event modeling, for auditory scenes, in which the hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to depict the characteristics and correlations among various events that constitute the scene. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for auditory scene classification.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Feng Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Feng", "Li Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Li", "Tong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Tong", "Gongyou Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Gongyou"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
