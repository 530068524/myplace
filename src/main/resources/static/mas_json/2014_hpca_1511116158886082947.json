Prior design methodologies aim for performance and efficiency, yet a deployed system may miss these targets due to run-time effects, which we denote as risk. We propose design strategies that explicitly aim to mitigate risk. We introduce new processor selection criteria, such as the coefficient of variation in performance, to produce heterogeneous configurations that balance performance risks and efficiency rewards. Out of the tens of strategies we consider, risk-aware approaches account for more than 70% of the strategies that produce systems with the best service quality. Applying these risk-mitigating strategies to heterogeneous datacenter design can produce a system that violates response time targets 50% less often.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Boston University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Marisabel Guevara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guevara:Marisabel", "Benjamin Lubin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lubin:Benjamin", "Benjamin C.
