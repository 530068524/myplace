We present a set of guidelines for movement-based game design that has emerged from our research-based game development practice. These guidelines have been examined and refined by 14 movement-based game design experts with experience in the academic, independent and commercial game development domains. We contextualize the guidelines using current findings about movement-based game and interaction design, taken from both published research papers and game design venues. Our primary contribution is a body of generative intermediate-level knowledge in the design research tradition that is readily accessible and actionable for the design of future movement-based games.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["RMIT University", "New York University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Florian Mueller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mueller_0001:Florian", "Katherine Isbister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isbister:Katherine"], "pages": 10}
