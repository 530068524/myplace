{"title": "Argus: End-to-end service anomaly detection and localization from an ISP's point of view.", "fields": ["service provider", "passive monitoring", "voice over ip", "network security", "routing table"], "abstract": "Recent trends in the networked services industry (e.g., CDN, VPN, VoIP, IPTV) see Internet Service Providers (ISPs) leveraging their existing network connectivity to provide an end-to-end solution. Consequently, new opportunities are available to monitor and improve the end-to-end service quality by leveraging the information from inside the network. We propose a new approach to detect and localize end-to-end service quality issues in such ISP-managed networked services by utilizing traffic data passively monitored at the ISP side, the ISP network topology, routing tables and geographic information. This paper presents the design of a generic service quality monitoring system \u201cArgus\u201d. Argus has been successfully deployed in a tier-1 ISP to monitor millions of users of its CDN service and assist operators to detect and localize end-to-end service quality issues. This operational experience demonstrates that Argus is effective in accurate, quick detection and localization of important service quality issues.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "Colorado State University"], "authors": ["He Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:He", "Ashley Flavel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flavel:Ashley", "Zihui Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Zihui", "Alexandre Gerber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerber:Alexandre", "Daniel Massey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massey:Daniel", "Christos Papadopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadopoulos:Christos", "Hiren Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Hiren", "Jennifer Yates.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yates:Jennifer"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
