Our method learns to combine appearance and motion information to produce pixel level segmentation masks for all prominent objects in videos. We formulate this task as a structured prediction problem and design a two-stream fully convolutional neural network which fuses together motion and appearance in a unified framework. Since large-scale video datasets with pixel level segmentations are problematic, we show how to bootstrap weakly annotated videos together with existing image recognition datasets for training. Through experiments on three challenging video segmentation benchmarks, our method substantially improves the state-of-the-art for segmenting generic (unseen) objects. Code and pre-trained models are available on the project website.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Suyog Dutt Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Suyog_Dutt", "Bo Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Bo", "Kristen Grauman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grauman:Kristen"], "pages": 10}
