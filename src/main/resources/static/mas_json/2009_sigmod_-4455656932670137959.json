{"title": "Efficient type-ahead search on relational data: a TASTIER approach.", "fields": ["search oriented architecture", "view", "sargable", "web search query", "query by example"], "abstract": "Existing keyword-search systems in relational databases require users to submit a complete query to compute answers. Often users feel \"left in the dark\" when they have limited knowledge about the data, and have to use a try-and-see approach for modifying queries and finding answers. In this paper we propose a novel approach to keyword search in the relational world, called Tastier. A Tastier system can bring instant gratification to users by supporting type-ahead search, which finds answers \"on the fly\" as the user types in query keywords. A main challenge is how to achieve a high interactive speed for large amounts of data in multiple tables, so that a query can be answered efficiently within milliseconds. We propose efficient index structures and algorithms for finding relevant answers on-the-fly by joining tuples in the database. We devise a partition-based method to improve query performance by grouping highly relevant tuples and pruning irrelevant tuples efficiently. We also develop a technique to answer a query efficiently by predicting the highly relevant complete queries for the user. We have conducted a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques on real data sets to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of this new search paradigm.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Guoliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Guoliang", "Shengyue Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Shengyue", "Chen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Chen", "Jianhua Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jianhua"], "pages": 12}
