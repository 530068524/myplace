{"title": "Formal Analysis of Dialogues on Infinite Argumentation Frameworks.", "fields": ["argumentation theory", "model checking", "artificial intelligence", "bisimulation", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "The paper analyses multi-agent strategic dialogues on possibly infinite argumentation frameworks. We develop a formal model for representing such dialogues, and introduce FOA-ATL, a first-order extension of alternating-time logic, for expressing the interplay of strategic and argumentation-theoretic properties. This setting is investigated with respect to the model checking problem, by means of a suitable notion of bisimulation. This notion of bisimulation is also used to shed light on how static properties of argumentation frameworks influence their dynamic behaviour.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Liverpool", "University of Paris", "Laboratoire IBI ... d'Evry, France"], "authors": ["Francesco Belardinelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belardinelli:Francesco", "Davide Grossi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossi:Davide", "Nicolas Maudet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maudet:Nicolas"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
