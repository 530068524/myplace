{"title": "A Boosting Framework on Grounds of Online Learning.", "fields": ["machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "duality", "computational learning theory", "boosting"], "abstract": "By exploiting the duality between boosting and online learning, we present a boosting framework which proves to be extremely powerful thanks to employing the vast knowledge available in the online learning area. Using this framework, we develop various algorithms to address multiple practically and theoretically interesting questions including sparse boosting, smooth-distribution boosting, agnostic learning and, as a by-product, some generalization to double-projection online learning algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tofigh Naghibi Mohamadpoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohamadpoor:Tofigh_Naghibi", "Beat Pfister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfister:Beat"], "pages": 9}
