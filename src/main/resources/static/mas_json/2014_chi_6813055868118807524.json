Despite this fact, there are very few means by which a user may take advantage of this large number of screens. We present Conductor, a prototype framework which serves as an exemplar for the construction of cross-device applications. We present a series of interaction methods by which users can easily share information, chain tasks across devices, and manage sessions across devices. We also present a cross-device usage scenario which utilizes several cross-device applications built within our prototype framework. We also describe a user study, which helped us to understand how users will take advantage of a large number of devices in support of performance of a sense making task.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Peter Hamilton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamilton:Peter", "Daniel J.
