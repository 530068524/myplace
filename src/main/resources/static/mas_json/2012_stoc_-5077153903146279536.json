By linear algebra we mean algebraic branching programs (ABPs) which are known to be computationally equivalent to two basic tools in linear algebra: iterated matrix multiplication and the determinant. We compare the computational power of multilinear ABPs to that of multilinear arithmetic formulas, and prove a tight super-polynomial separation between the two models. Specifically, we describe an explicit  n -variate polynomial F that is computed by a linear-size multilinear ABP but every multilinear formula computing F must be of size n \u03a9(log n) .", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Sorbonne", "Sorbonne", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Zeev Dvir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dvir:Zeev", "Guillaume Malod.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malod:Guillaume", "Sylvain Perifel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perifel:Sylvain", "Amir Yehudayoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yehudayoff:Amir"], "pages": 10}
