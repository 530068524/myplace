{"title": "Pinpoint: fast and precise sparse value flow analysis for million lines of code.", "fields": ["source lines of code", "satisfiability modulo theories", "memorization", "slicing", "pointer"], "abstract": "When dealing with millions of lines of code, we still cannot have the cake and eat it: sparse value-flow analysis is powerful in checking source-sink problems, but existing work cannot escape from the \u201cpointer trap\u201d \u2013 a precise points-to analysis limits its scalability and an imprecise one seriously undermines its precision. We present Pinpoint, a holistic approach that decomposes the cost of high-precision points-to analysis by precisely discovering local data dependence and delaying the expensive inter-procedural analysis through memorization. Such memorization enables the on-demand slicing of only the necessary inter-procedural data dependence and path feasibility queries, which are then solved by a costly SMT solver. Experiments show that Pinpoint can check programs such as MySQL (around 2 million lines of code) within 1.5 hours. The overall false positive rate is also very low (14.3% - 23.6%). Pinpoint has discovered over forty real bugs in mature and extensively checked open source systems. And the implementation of Pinpoint and all experimental results are freely available.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Sourcebrella, China", "Sourcebrella, China"], "authors": ["Qingkai Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Qingkai", "Xiao Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0003:Xiao", "Rongxin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Rongxin", "Jinguo Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Jinguo", "Gang Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Gang", "Charles Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Charles"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2018", "pages": 14}
