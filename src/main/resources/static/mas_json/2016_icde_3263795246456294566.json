This topic became very hot due to the recent explosion in the amount of spatial data generated by smartphones, satellites and medical devices, among others. This tutorial goes beyond the use of existing systems as-is (e.g., Hadoop, Spark or Impala), and digs deep into the core components of big systems (e.g., indexing and query processing) to describe how they are designed to handle big spatial data. During this 90-minute tutorial, we review the state-of-the-art work in the area of Big Spatial Data while classifying the existing research efforts according to the implementation approach, underlying architecture, and system components. In addition, we provide case studies of full-fledged systems and applications that handle Big Spatial Data which allows the audience to better comprehend the whole tutorial.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Ahmed Eldawy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eldawy:Ahmed", "Mohamed F.
