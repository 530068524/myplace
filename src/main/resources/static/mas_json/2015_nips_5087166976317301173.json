However, the complexity offered by state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e. interior-point method and primal, dual simplex methods) is still unsatisfactory for problems in machine learning with huge number of variables and constraints. In this paper, we investigate a general LP algorithm based on the combination of Augmented Lagrangian and Coordinate Descent (AL-CD), giving an iteration complexity of O((log(1/\u220a))2) with O(nnz(A)) cost per iteration, where nnz(A) is the number of non-zeros in the m x n constraint matrix A, and in practice, one can further reduce cost per iteration to the order of non-zeros in columns (rows) corresponding to the active primal (dual) variables through an active-set strategy. The algorithm thus yields a tractable alternative to standard LP methods for large-scale problems of sparse solutions and nnz(A) \u226a mn. We conduct experiments on large-scale LP instances from l1 -regularized multi-class SVM, Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation, and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, where the proposed approach finds solutions of 10-3 precision orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art implementations of interior-point and simplex methods.1", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Davis", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ian En-Hsu Yen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yen:Ian_En=Hsu", "Kai Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Kai", "Cho-Jui Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Cho=Jui", "Pradeep Ravikumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravikumar:Pradeep", "Inderjit S.
