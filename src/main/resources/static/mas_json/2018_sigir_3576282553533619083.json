{"title": "A Co-Memory Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "computer science", "data mining", "classifier", "social media analytics"], "abstract": "With the rapid increase of diversity and modality of data in user-generated contents, sentiment analysis as a core area of social media analytics has gone beyond traditional text-based analysis. Multimodal sentiment analysis has become an important research topic in recent years. Most of the existing work on multimodal sentiment analysis extracts features from image and text separately, and directly combine them to train a classifier. As visual and textual information in multimodal data can mutually reinforce and complement each other in analyzing the sentiment of people, previous research all ignores this mutual influence between image and text. To fill this gap, in this paper, we consider the interrelation of visual and textual information, and propose a novel co-memory network to iteratively model the interactions between visual contents and textual words for multimodal sentiment analysis. Experimental results on two public multimodal sentiment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Nan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Nan", "Wenji Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Wenji", "Guandan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Guandan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
