In this paper, we provide support for a new type of query, the Reverse Top-k Geo-Social Keyword (RkGSK) query. This query takes into account spatial, textual, and social information, and finds prospective customers for geotagged objects. As an example, a restaurant manager might apply the query to find prospective customers. To address this, we propose a hybrid index, the GIM-tree, which indexes locations, keywords, and social information of geo-tagged users and objects, and then, using the GIM-tree, we present efficient RkGSK query processing algorithms that exploit several pruning strategies. The effectiveness of RkGSK retrieval is characterized via a case study, and extensive experiments using real datasets offer insight into the efficiency of the proposed index and algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "College of Computer Science", "Department of Computer Science"], "authors": ["Jingwen Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Jingwen", "Yunjun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yunjun", "Gang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Gang", "Christian S.
