Travi-Navi records high quality images during the course of a guider's walk on the navigation paths, collects a rich set of sensor readings, and packs them into a navigation trace. The followers track the navigation trace, get prompt visual instructions and image tips, and receive alerts when they deviate from the correct paths. Travi-Navi also finds the most efficient shortcuts whenever possible. We encounter and solve several challenges, including robust tracking, shortcut identification, and high quality image capture while walking. We implement Travi-Navi and conduct extensive experiments. The evaluation results show that Travi-Navi can track and navigate users with timely instructions, typically within a 4-step offset, and detect deviation events within 9 steps.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Nanyang Technological University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Yuanqing Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yuanqing", "Guobin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Guobin", "Liqun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Liqun", "Chunshui Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Chunshui", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo", "Feng Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Feng"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
