The main contribution of this paper involves the proposal of a family of routing schemes, called Forest Routing. These are based on the principles of geometric routing, adding flexibility in its load balancing characteristics. This is achieved by using an aggregation of greedy embeddings along with a configurable distance function. Incorporating link load information in the forwarding layer enables load balancing behavior while still attaining low path stretch. In addition, the proposed schemes are validated regarding their resilience towards network failures.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University"], "authors": ["Rein Houthooft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Houthooft:Rein", "Sahel Sahhaf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahhaf:Sahel", "Wouter Tavernier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tavernier:Wouter", "Filip De Turck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turck:Filip_De", "Didier Colle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colle:Didier", "Mario Pickavet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pickavet:Mario"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
