The best way to invoke AA is unclear, but two ways include critical events and the operator's state. A hybrid model of AA invocation, the dynamic model of operator overload (DMOO), that takes into account critical events and the operator's state was recently shown to improve performance. The DMOO initiates AA using critical events and attention allocation, informed by eye movements. We compared the DMOO with an inaccurate automation invocation system and a system that invoked AA based only on critical events. Fewer errors were made with DMOO than with the inaccurate system. In the critical event condition, where automation was invoked at an earlier point in time, there were more memory and planning errors, while for the DMOO condition, which invocated automation at a later point in time, there were more perceptual errors. These findings provide a framework for reducing specific types of errors through different automation invocation.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["George Mason University", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "George Mason University", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Daniel Gartenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gartenberg:Daniel", "Leonard A.
