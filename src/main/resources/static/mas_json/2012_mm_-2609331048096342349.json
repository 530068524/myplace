Nowadays, the computational model for beauty estimation has been actively explored in computer science community, yet with the focus mainly on facial features. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of female attractiveness conveyed by single/multiple modalities of cues, i.e., face, dressing and/or voice, and aim to uncover how different modalities individually and collectively affect the human sense of beauty. To this end, we collect the first Multi-Modality Beauty (M 2 B) dataset in the world for female attractiveness study, which is thoroughly annotated with attractiveness levels converted from manual  k -wise ratings and semantic attributes of different modalities. A novel Dual-supervised Feature-Attribute-Task (DFAT) network is proposed to jointly learn the beauty estimation models of single/multiple modalities as well as the attribute estimation models. The DFAT network differentiates itself by its supervision in both attribute and task layers. Several interesting beauty-sense observations over single/multiple modalities are reported, and the extensive experimental evaluations on the collected M2B dataset well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DFAT network for female attractiveness estimation.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "National University of Defense Technology", "Microsoft", "National Labora ...
