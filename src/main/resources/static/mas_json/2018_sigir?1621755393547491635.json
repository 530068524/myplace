{"title": "Attention-based Hierarchical Neural Query Suggestion.", "fields": ["observable", "semantic similarity", "information retrieval", "artificial neural network", "search engine"], "abstract": "Query suggestions help users of a search engine to refine their queries. Previous work on query suggestion has mainly focused on incorporating directly observable features such as query co-occurrence and semantic similarity. The structure of such features is often set manually, as a result of which hidden dependencies between queries and users may be ignored. We propose an AHNQS model that combines a hierarchical structure with a session-level neural network and a user-level neural network to model the short- and long-term search history of a user. An attention mechanism is used to capture user preferences. We quantify the improvements of AHNQS over state-of-the-art RNN-based query suggestion baselines on the AOL query log dataset, with improvements of up to 21.86% and 22.99% in terms of MRR@10 and Recall@10, respectively, over the state-of-the-art; improvements are especially large for short sessions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Wanyu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wanyu", "Fei Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Fei", "Honghui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Honghui", "Maarten de Rijke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rijke:Maarten_de"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
