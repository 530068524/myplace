{"title": "The Effects of Social Exclusion on Play Experience and Hostile Cognitions in Digital Games.", "fields": ["feeling", "ostracism", "social exclusion", "multiplayer game", "social nature"], "abstract": "The social nature of multiplayer games provides compelling play experiences that are dynamic, unpredictable, and satisfying; however, playing digital games with others can result in feeling socially excluded. There are several known harmful effects of ostracism, including on cognition and the interpretation of social information. To investigate the effects of social exclusion in the context of a multiplayer game, we developed and validated a social exclusion paradigm that we embedded in an online game. Called Operator Challenge, our paradigm influenced feelings of social exclusion and access to hostile cognitions (measured through a word-completion task). In addition, the degree of experienced belonging predicted player enjoyment, effort, and the number of hostile words completed; however, the experience measures did not mediate the relationship between belonging and access to hostile cognitions. Our work facilitates understanding the causes and effects of exclusion, which is important for the study of player experience in multiplayer games.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Saskatchewan", "University of Trier", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Trier", "University of Saskatchewan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Max Valentin Birk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Birk:Max_Valentin", "Benjamin Buttlar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buttlar:Benjamin", "Jason T.
