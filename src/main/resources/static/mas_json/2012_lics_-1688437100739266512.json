{"title": "A Constructive Proof of Dependent Choice, Compatible with Classical Logic.", "fields": ["axiom of countable choice", "axiom schema", "constructive set theory", "axiom of dependent choice", "bar induction"], "abstract": "Martin-Lof's type theory has strong existential elimination (dependent sum type) that allows to prove the full axiom of choice. However the theory is intuitionistic. We give a condition on strong existential elimination that makes it computationally compatible with classical logic. With this restriction, we lose the full axiom of choice but, thanks to a lazily-evaluated coinductive representation of quantification, we are still able to constructively prove the axiom of countable choice, the axiom of dependent choice, and a form of bar induction in ways that make each of them computationally compatible with classical logic.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Hugo Herbelin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herbelin:Hugo"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
