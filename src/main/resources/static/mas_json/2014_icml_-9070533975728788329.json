Our approach relies on the recently proposed Tensor Train format (TT-format) of a tensor that while being compact allows for efficient application of linear algebra operations. We present a way to convert the energy of a Markov random field to the TT-format and show how one can exploit the properties of the TT-format to attack the tasks of the partition function estimation and the MAP-inference. We provide theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of the proposed algorithm for estimating the partition function and compare our methods against several state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Moscow State University", "Moscow State University", "Moscow State University", "Moscow State University", "National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics", "National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics", "National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Alexander Novikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novikov:Alexander", "Anton Rodomanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodomanov:Anton", "Anton Osokin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osokin:Anton", "Dmitry P.
