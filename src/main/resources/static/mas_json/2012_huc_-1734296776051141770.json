{"title": "Digital Object Memories for the Internet of Things (DOMe-Iot).", "fields": ["continuation", "component based software engineering", "conversation", "internet of things", "intelligent environment"], "abstract": "The Internet of Things connects digital information sources with physical objects - which transforms an artifact from being a passive object into a 'thing' that may link to data, store data and even offer data to users. Digital Object Memories (DOMe) comprise hardware and software components, which together provide an open and universal platform for capturing, associating, and interacting with the digital information of connected objects - including storage, documentation and provision of information concerning actions an object is or might be involved in. The goal of this continuation of an established workshop series (predecessor events include DIPSO 2007-09 in conjunction with Ubicomp 2007-09, DOMe in conjunction with Intelligent Environment 2009, DOMe-IoT 2010 in conjunction with Ubicomp 2010, and NOMe-IoT in conjunction with Ubicomp 2011) is to twofold:  1.)  initiate a conversation concerning the potential for objects to develop agency; and  2.)  explore how data that is associated with an object may leverage real-world actions. Here, DOMe 2012 provides a hybrid interdisciplinary workshop format that will combine traditional presentations and discussion with practice-based experimentation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "Bell Labs", "Newcastle University", "Edinburgh Schoo ... cture, Scotland"], "authors": ["Fahim Kawsar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawsar:Fahim", "Chris Speed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Speed:Chris", "Alexander Kr\u00f6ner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=ouml=ner:Alexander", "Jens Haupert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haupert:Jens", "Thomas Pl\u00f6tz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pl=ouml=tz:Thomas", "Daniel Schreiber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schreiber:Daniel"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
