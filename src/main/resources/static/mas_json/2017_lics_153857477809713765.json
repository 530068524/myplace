This enables us to separate the descriptive complexity of solving linear equations from full fixed-point logic with counting by logical means. As an application of these results, we separate an extension of first-order logic with a rank operator from fixed-point logic with counting, solving an open problem due to Holm [21]. We then draw a connection from this work in descriptive complexity theory to graph isomorphism testing and propositional proof complexity. Answering an open question from [7], we separate the strength of certain algebraic graph-isomorphism tests. This result can also be phrased as a separation of the algebraic propositional proof systems \u201cNullstellensatz\u201d and \u201cmonomial PC\u201d.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Martin Grohe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grohe:Martin", "Wied Pakusa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pakusa:Wied"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
