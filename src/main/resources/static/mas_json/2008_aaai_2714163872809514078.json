Data mining identifies discrepancies between previous observations and predictions made by Earth science models. Locations of these discrepancies become interesting targets for future observations. Such targets become goals used by a flight planner to generate the observation activities. The cycle of observation, data analysis and planning is repeated continuously throughout a multi-week Earth science investigation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center"], "authors": ["Robert A.
