In this paper, we argue that open multi-agent systems can be effectively designed and implemented as electronic institutions, for which we provide a comprehensive computational model. More specifically, the paper provides an operational semantics for electronic institutions, specifying the essential data structures, the state representation and the key operations necessary to implement them.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Goldsmiths, University of London", "King's College London", "Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Mark d'Inverno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/d=Inverno:Mark", "Michael Luck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luck:Michael", "Pablo Noriega.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noriega:Pablo", "Juan A.
