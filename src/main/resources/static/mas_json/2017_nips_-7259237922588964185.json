We show for the first time that $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ learning bounds can be achieved with only $O(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)$ random features rather than $O({n})$ as suggested by previous results. Further, we prove faster learning rates and show that they might require more random features, unless they are sampled according to a possibly problem dependent distribution. Our results shed light on the statistical computational trade-offs in large scale kernelized learning, showing the potential effectiveness of random features in reducing the computational complexity while keeping optimal generalization properties.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alessandro Rudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudi:Alessandro", "Lorenzo Rosasco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosasco:Lorenzo"], "pages": 11}
