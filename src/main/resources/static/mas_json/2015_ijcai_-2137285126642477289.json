{"title": "Epistemic Quantified Boolean Logic: Expressiveness and Completeness Results.", "fields": ["multimodal logic", "product term", "autoepistemic logic", "zeroth order logic", "predicate functor logic"], "abstract": "We introduce epistemic quantified boolean logic (EQBL), an extension of propositional epistemic logic with quantification over propositions. We show that EQBL can express relevant properties about agents' knowledge in multi-agent contexts, such as \"agent a knows as much as agent b\". We analyse the expressiveness of EQBL through a translation into monadic second-order logic, and provide completeness results w.r.t. various classes of Kripke frames. Finally, we prove that model checking EQBL is PSPACE-complete. Thus, the complexity of model checking EQBL is no harder than for (non-modal) quantified boolean logic.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Liverpool", "Laboratoire IBI ... d'Evry, France"], "authors": ["Francesco Belardinelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belardinelli:Francesco", "Wiebe van der Hoek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoek:Wiebe_van_der"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
