It has worst-case running time n^{\\frac{1}{2}} m^{\\frac{1}{2}} s^2 \\poly(\\log(n), \\log(m), R, r, 1/\u03b4), with n and s the dimension and row-sparsity of the input matrices, respectively, m the number of constraints, \u03b4 the accuracy of the solution, and R, r upper bounds on the size of the optimal primal and dual solutions, respectively. This gives a square-root unconditional speed-up over any classical method for solving SDPs both in n and m. We prove the algorithm cannot be substantially improved (in terms of n and m) giving a \u03a9(n^{\\frac{1}{2}}+m^{\\frac{1}{2}}) quantum lower bound for solving semidefinite programs with constant s, R, r and \u03b4. The quantum algorithm is constructed by a combination of quantum Gibbs sampling and the multiplicative weight method. In particular it is based on a classical algorithm of Arora and Kale for approximately solving SDPs. We present a modification of their algorithm to eliminate the need for solving an inner linear program which may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Fernando G.
