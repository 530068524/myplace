We propose a charging technique for polar aerosols (e.g., mist or fog) that allows control of the shape and trajectory of such non-solid diffusers using electric fields. We report experiments that allowed us to design a charging mechanism that produces charged fog aerosols with homogeneous electrical mobility. We illustrate our idea by demonstrating how electric fields can be used to control the shape of a fog display and the trajectory of a bubble display.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Deepak Ranjan Sahoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahoo:Deepak_Ranjan", "Diego Mart\u00ednez Plasencia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plasencia:Diego_Mart=iacute=nez", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram"], "pages": 4}
