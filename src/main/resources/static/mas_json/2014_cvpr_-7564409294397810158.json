In this paper we discover that the data captured by a multifrequency time-of-flight (ToF) camera is the Fourier transform of a transient image, and identify the sources of systematic error. Based on the discovery we propose a novel framework of frequency-domain transient imaging, as well as algorithms to remove systematic error. The whole process of our approach is of much lower computational cost, especially lower memory usage, than Heide et al.'s approach using the same device. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-datasets.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "University of Bonn", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jingyu Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Jingyu", "Yebin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yebin", "Matthias B.
