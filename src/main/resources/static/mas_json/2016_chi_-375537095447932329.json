This project allows us to investigate the complexities and nuances of a case where people engage in a process of making, transforming and adapting a space they live in. This example opens a radically different and productive context for revisiting concepts that are currently at the center of human-computer interaction (HCI) research: ubiquitous computing, home automation, smart homes, and the Internet of Things. We offer six qualities characterizing the evolving relationship between the makers and the lived-in environment: the van. We conclude with a discussion on the two themes of living in a reconfigured home and prototype qualities in a reconfigured space, and a critical reflection around the theme of the invariably unfinished home.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Audrey Desjardins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desjardins:Audrey", "Ron Wakkary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wakkary:Ron"], "pages": 12}
