{"title": "A micro-architectural analysis of switched photonic multi-chip interconnects.", "fields": ["photonics", "waveguide", "point to point", "optical switch", "silicon photonics"], "abstract": "Silicon photonics is a promising technology to scale offchip bandwidth in a power-efficient manner. Given equivalent bandwidth, the flexibility of switched networks often leads to the assumption that they deliver greater performance than point-to-point networks on message passing applications with low-radix traffic patterns. However, when optical losses are considered and total optical power is constrained, this assumption no longer holds.   In this paper we present a power constrained method for designing photonic interconnects that uses the power characteristics and limits of optical switches, waveguide crossings, inter-layer couplers and waveguides. We apply this method to design three switched network topologies for a multi-chip system.   Using synthetic and HPC benchmark-derived message patterns, we simulated the three switched networks and a WDM point-to-point network. We show that switched networks outperform point-to-point networks only when the optical losses of switches and inter-layer couplers losses are each 0.75 dB or lower; achieving this would require a major breakthrough in device development. We then show that this result extends to any switched network with similarly complex topology, through simulations of an idealized \"perfect\" network that supports 90% of the peak bandwidth under all traffic patterns. We conclude that given a fixed amount of input optical power, under realistic device assumptions, a point-to-point network has the best performance and energy characteristics.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Oracle Corporation"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Pranay Koka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koka:Pranay", "Michael O.
