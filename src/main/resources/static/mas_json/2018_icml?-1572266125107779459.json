At the core of our algorithm is a novel semi-stochastic gradient along with a semi-stochastic Hessian, which are specifically designed for cubic regularization method. We show that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an $(\\epsilon,\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$-approximately local minimum within $\\tilde{O}(n^{4/5}/\\epsilon^{3/2})$ second-order oracle calls, which outperforms the state-of-the-art cubic regularization algorithms including subsampled cubic regularization. Our work also sheds light on the application of variance reduction technique to high-order non-convex optimization methods. Thorough experiments on various non-convex optimization problems support our theory.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Dongruo Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Dongruo", "Pan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Pan", "Quanquan Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Quanquan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
