The input to the design flow is a high level description of the control algorithms given in a model-based environment such as Simulink. The input specification is translated into an intermediate format, and then automatically refined into a distributed implementation. Refinement includes optimal mapping of the functional specification on a set of computation and communication resources, and software synthesis, which generates code for each component in the mapped design while guaranteeing semantic equivalence with the original specification. Experiments with a temperature control system are presented to illustrate the flow.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Intel"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Yang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0040:Yang", "Alessandro Pinto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinto:Alessandro", "Alberto L.
