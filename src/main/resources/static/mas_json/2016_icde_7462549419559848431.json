{"title": "When two choices are not enough: Balancing at scale in Distributed Stream Processing.", "fields": ["stream processing", "operator", "skew", "tuple", "routing table"], "abstract": "Carefully balancing load in distributed stream processing systems has a fundamental impact on execution latency and throughput. Load balancing is challenging because real-world workloads are skewed: some tuples in the stream are associated to keys which are significantly more frequent than others. Skew is remarkably more problematic in large deployments: having more workers implies fewer keys per worker, so it becomes harder to \u201caverage out\u201d the cost of hot keys with cold keys. We propose a novel load balancing technique that uses a heavy hitter algorithm to efficiently identify the hottest keys in the stream. These hot keys are assigned to d \u2265 2 choices to ensure a balanced load, where d is tuned automatically to minimize the memory and computation cost of operator replication. The technique works online and does not require the use of routing tables. Our extensive evaluation shows that our technique can balance real-world workloads on large deployments, and improve throughput and latency by 150% and 60% respectively over the previous state-of-the-art when deployed on Apache Storm.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Muhammad Anis Uddin Nasir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nasir:Muhammad_Anis_Uddin", "Gianmarco De Francisci Morales.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morales:Gianmarco_De_Francisci", "Nicolas Kourtellis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kourtellis:Nicolas", "Marco Serafini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serafini:Marco"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
