Performance-derived improvisation methods were used to inspire a sense of agency with ICT in people marginalized from digital design. A case study of an older person's experience shows the techniques supporting her to reconceive her response to technology. In particular, we analyze how using a \"prop\" as a design artifact allows her to imagine new possibilities and take a more assertive role.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Sheffield Hallam University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ann Light.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Light:Ann"], "pages": 4}
