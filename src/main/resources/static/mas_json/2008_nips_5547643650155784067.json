In this paper, we extend this criterion to deal with structured and interdependent observations. This is achieved by modeling the structures using undirected graphical models and comparing the Hilbert space embeddings of distributions. We apply this new criterion to independent component analysis and sequence clustering.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Yahoo!", "MPI Tubingen fo ... ingen, Germany"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Xinhua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinhua", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le", "Arthur Gretton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gretton:Arthur", "Alexander J.
