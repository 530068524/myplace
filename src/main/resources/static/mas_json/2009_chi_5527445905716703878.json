Computational prediction of gene function promises to help focus limited experimental resources on the most likely hypotheses. Several algorithms using diverse genomic data have been applied to this task in model organisms; however, the performance of such approaches in mammals has not yet been evaluated.", "citation": "Citations (245)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Harvard University", "Princeton University", "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology", "University of Missouri", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Stanford University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Stanford University", "University of Jordan", "University of Jordan", "University of Jordan", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University College Dublin", "INESC-ID", "University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud", "Fluxome Science ...
