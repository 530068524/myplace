An English-Chinese bilingual parallel corpus is used to construct the bilingual semantic network for determining more meaningful text terms and characterizing the inter-term correlations and similarity contexts between multiple inter-related text terms more precisely. Our experiments on CWMT2009 and CLEF have provided very promising results.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["Yuejie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yuejie", "Lei Cen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cen:Lei", "Cheng Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Cheng", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang", "Ning Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ning"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
