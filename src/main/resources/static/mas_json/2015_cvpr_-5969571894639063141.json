The conventional convolutional layer uses filters that are learned during training and are held constant during testing. In contrast, the dynamic convolutional layer uses filters that will vary from input to input during testing. This is achieved by learning a function that maps the input to the filters. We apply the dynamic convolutional layer to the application of short range weather prediction and show performance improvements compared to other baselines.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Benjamin Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Benjamin", "Lior Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Lior", "Yehuda Afek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Afek:Yehuda"], "pages": 9}
