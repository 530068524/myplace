{"title": "Self-Representation in Girard's System U.", "fields": ["typed lambda calculus", "predicate", "system f", "system u", "infinite regress"], "abstract": "In 1991, Pfenning and Lee studied whether System F could support a typed self-interpreter. They concluded that typed self-representation for System F \"seems to be impossible\", but were able to represent System F in F \u03c9 . Further, they found that the representation of F \u03c9  requires kind polymorphism, which is outside F \u03c9 . In 2009, Rendel, Ostermann and Hofer conjectured that the representation of kind-polymorphic terms would require another, higher form of polymorphism. Is this a case of infinite regress? We show that it is not and present a typed self-representation for Girard's System U, the first for a \u03bb-calculus with decidable type checking. System U extends System F \u03c9  with kind polymorphic terms and types. We show that kind polymorphic types (i.e. types that depend on kinds) are sufficient to \"tie the knot\" -- they enable representations of kind polymorphic terms without introducing another form of polymorphism. Our self-representation supports operations that iterate over a term, each of which can be applied to a representation of itself. We present three typed self-applicable operations: a self-interpreter that recovers a term from its representation, a predicate that tests the intensional structure of a term, and a typed continuation-passing-style (CPS) transformation -- the first typed self-applicable CPS transformation. Our techniques could have applications from verifiably type-preserving metaprograms, to growable typed languages, to more efficient self-interpreters.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Matt Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brown:Matt", "Jens Palsberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palsberg:Jens"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2015", "pages": 14}
