{"title": "Partial Truthfulness in Minimal Peer Prediction Mechanisms With Limited Knowledge.", "fields": ["binary logarithm", "data mining", "artificial intelligence", "inefficiency", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We study minimal single-task peer prediction mechanisms that have limited knowledge about agents' beliefs. Without knowing what agents' beliefs are or eliciting additional information, it is not possible to design a truthful mechanism in a Bayesian-Nash sense. We go beyond truthfulness and explore equilibrium strategy profiles that are only partially truthful. Using the results from the multi-armed bandit literature, we give a characterization of how inefficient these equilibria are comparing to truthful reporting. We measure the inefficiency of such strategies by counting the number of dishonest reports that any minimal knowledge-bounded mechanism must have. We show that the order of this number is $\\Theta(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of agents, and we provide a peer prediction mechanism that achieves this bound in expectation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Harvard University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Goran Radanovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radanovic:Goran", "Boi Faltings.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faltings:Boi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
