SAFE is a framework for modern Web application development with automated state consistency, enforced security at various levels, and design for Web personalization and extensibility. With the emerging complexity in (extensible) data-driven Web application development, in particular in terms of consistent data management with multiple clients (many Facebook users), ownership preservation (various Facebook user items with individual intellectual property), and data privacy (sensitive Facebook user data), we believe a demo of a comprehensive data-centric and secure Web application framework with declarative specifications for many modern Web features will be of considerable interest to the security community. In particular, we think it is interesting to see a demonstration of how fast and how intuitive the secure customization of a true multi-tier Web application can be.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Raphael M.
