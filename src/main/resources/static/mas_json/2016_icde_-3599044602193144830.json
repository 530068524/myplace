Hyrise-NV is a database storage engine that maintains table and index structures on NVM. Our architecture updates the database state and index structures transactionally consistent on NVM using multi-version data structures, allowing to instantly recover data-bases independent of their size. In this paper, we demonstrate the instant restart capabilities of Hyrise-NV, storing all data on non-volatile memory. Recovering a dataset of size 92.2 GB takes about 53 seconds using our log-based approach, whereas Hyrise-NV recovers in under one second.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "authors": ["David Schwalb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwalb:David", "Martin Faust.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faust:Martin", "Markus Dreseler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dreseler:Markus", "Pedro Flemming.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flemming:Pedro", "Hasso Plattner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plattner:Hasso"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
