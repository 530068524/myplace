We exploit the spatial signature induced by the radio communications of a node on its neighboring nodes. We design a primitive that robustly and efficiently realizes this concept, even at the level of individual packets and when the network is relatively sparse. Using this primitive, we design a protocol that robustly and efficiently validates the authenticity of the source of messages: authentic messages incur no communication overhead whereas masqueraded communications are detected cooperatively by the neighboring nodes. The protocol enables lightweight collusion-resistant methods for broadcast authentication, unicast authentication, non-repudiation and integrity of communication. We have implemented our primitive and protocol, and quantified the high-level of accuracy of the protocol via testbed experiments with  CC1000  radio-enabled motes.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Lifeng Sang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sang:Lifeng", "Anish Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Anish"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
