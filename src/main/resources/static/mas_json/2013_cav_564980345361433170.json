{"title": "Flow*: An Analyzer for Non-linear Hybrid Systems.", "fields": ["spectrum analyzer", "heuristic", "hybrid system", "polynomial", "invariant"], "abstract": "The tool Flow* performs Taylor model-based flowpipe construction for non-linear (polynomial) hybrid systems. Flow* combines well-known Taylor model arithmetic techniques for guaranteed approximations of the continuous dynamics in each mode with a combination of approaches for handling mode invariants and discrete transitions. Flow* supports a wide variety of optimizations including adaptive step sizes, adaptive selection of approximation orders and the heuristic selection of template directions for aggregating flowpipes. This paper describes Flow* and demonstrates its performance on a series of non-linear continuous and hybrid system benchmarks. Our comparisons show that Flow* is competitive with other tools.", "citation": "Citations (240)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Xin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0002:Xin", "Erika \u00c1brah\u00e1m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Aacute=brah=aacute=m:Erika", "Sriram Sankaranarayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankaranarayanan:Sriram"], "pages": 6}
