Knowing the user's mental workload is desirable for many application scenarios, ranging from driving a car, to adaptive workplace setups. Typically, physiological sensors allow inferring mental workload, but these sensors might be rather uncomfortable to wear. Measuring pupil diameter through remote eye-tracking instead is an unobtrusive method. However, a practical eye-tracking-based system must also account for pupil changes due to variable lighting conditions. Based on the results of a study with tasks of varying mental demand and six different lighting conditions, we built a simple model that is able to infer the workload independently of the lighting condition in 75% of the tested conditions.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "Clemson University", "University of Stuttgart", "University of New Hampshire"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Bastian Pfleging.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfleging:Bastian", "Drea K.
