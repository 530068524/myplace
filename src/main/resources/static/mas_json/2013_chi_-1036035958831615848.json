We introduce CrashAlert, a system that augments mobile devices with a depth camera, to provide distance and location visual cues of obstacles on the user's path. In a realistic environment outside the lab, CrashAlert users improve their handling of potential collisions, dodging and slowing down for simple ones while lifting their head in more complex situations. Qualitative results outline the value of extending users' peripheral alertness in eyes-busy mobile interaction through non-intrusive depth cues, as used in CrashAlert. We present the design features of our system and lessons learned from our evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Manitoba", "University of Manitoba"], "authors": ["Juan David Hincapi\u00e9-Ramos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hincapi=eacute==Ramos:Juan_David", "Pourang Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Pourang"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
