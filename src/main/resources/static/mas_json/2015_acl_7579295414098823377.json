{"title": "Learning Anaphoricity and Antecedent Ranking Features for Coreference Resolution.", "fields": ["ranking", "artificial intelligence", "test set", "pattern recognition", "coreference"], "abstract": "We introduce a simple, non-linear mention-ranking model for coreference resolution that attempts to learn distinct feature representations for anaphoricity detection and antecedent ranking, which we encourage by pre-training on a pair of corresponding subtasks. Although we use only simple, unconjoined features, the model is able to learn useful representations, and we report the best overall score on the CoNLL 2012 English test set to date.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Facebook"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sam Wiseman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiseman:Sam", "Alexander M.
