The proposed estimator is derived from minimization of homogeneous divergence and can be constructed without calculation of the normalization constant, which is frequently infeasible for models in the discrete space. We investigate statistical properties of the proposed estimator such as consistency and asymptotic normality, and reveal a relationship with the information geometry. Some experiments show that the proposed estimator attains comparable performance to the maximum likelihood estimator with drastically lower computational cost.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Future University Hakodate", "Nagoya University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Takashi Takenouchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takenouchi:Takashi", "Takafumi Kanamori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanamori:Takafumi"], "pages": 9}
