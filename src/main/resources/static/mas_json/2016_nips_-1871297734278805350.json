Here, we first propose a new intuitive principle of unsupervised deep learning from time series which uses the nonstationary structure of the data. Our learning principle, time-contrastive learning (TCL), finds a representation which allows optimal discrimination of time segments (windows). Surprisingly, we show how TCL can be related to a nonlinear ICA model, when ICA is redefined to include temporal nonstationarities. In particular, we show that TCL combined with linear ICA estimates the nonlinear ICA model up to point-wise transformations of the sources, and this solution is unique --- thus providing the first identifiability result for nonlinear ICA which is rigorous, constructive, as well as very general.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Helsinki"], "authors": ["Aapo Hyv\u00e4rinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hyv=auml=rinen:Aapo", "Hiroshi Morioka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morioka:Hiroshi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
