We describe a convolutional architecture dubbed the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that we adopt for the semantic modelling of sentences. The network uses Dynamic k-Max Pooling, a global pooling operation over linear sequences. The network handles input sentences of varying length and induces a feature graph over the sentence that is capable of explicitly capturing short and long-range relations. The network does not rely on a parse tree and is easily applicable to any language. We test the DCNN in four experiments: small scale binary and multi-class sentiment prediction, six-way question classification and Twitter sentiment prediction by distant supervision. The network achieves excellent performance in the first three tasks and a greater than 25% error reduction in the last task with respect to the strongest baseline.", "citation": "Citations (1,358)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nal Kalchbrenner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalchbrenner:Nal", "Edward Grefenstette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grefenstette:Edward", "Phil Blunsom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blunsom:Phil"], "pages": 11}
