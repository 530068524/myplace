The phenomenon, known as Subitizing, inspires us to pursue the task of Salient Object Subitizing (SOS), i.e. predicting the existence and the number of salient objects in a scene using holistic cues. To study this problem, we propose a new image dataset annotated using an online crowdsourcing marketplace. We show that a proposed subitizing technique using an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model achieves significantly better than chance performance in matching human labels on our dataset. It attains 94% accuracy in detecting the existence of salient objects, and 42\u201382% accuracy (chance is 20%) in predicting the number of salient objects (1, 2, 3, and 4+), without resorting to any object localization process. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed subitizing technique in two computer vision applications: salient object detection and object proposal.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Boston University", "Boston University", "Boston University", "Boston University", "Boston University", "Adobe Systems", "Boston University", "Boston University", "Boston University", "Boston University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jianming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jianming", "Shugao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shugao", "Mehrnoosh Sameki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sameki:Mehrnoosh", "Stan Sclaroff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sclaroff:Stan", "Margrit Betke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Betke:Margrit", "Zhe L.
