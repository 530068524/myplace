In addition to the query result, a service provider that evaluates moving queries often returns mobile clients a safe region that bounds the validity of query results to minimize the communication cost between the two parties. However, when a service provider is not trustworthy, it may send inaccurate query results or incorrect safe regions to clients. In this paper, we present a framework and algorithms to authenticate results and safe regions of moving kNN queries. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show that our methods are efficient in terms of both computation time and communication costs.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Man Lung Yiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yiu:Man_Lung", "Eric Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo:Eric", "Duncan Yung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yung:Duncan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
