In this paper, we present TerraGuide, a novel multi-surface environment for exploratory terrain analysis. TerraGuide provides three tightly coupled displays including a real-time viewshed, a 3D panoramic view, and a helicopter view controlled by an optically tracked tablet. A user study compared these techniques and identified users' strategies in solving a complex terrain analysis problem. Users overwhelmingly adopted a bi-manual use of the tabletop viewshed and tablet-based helicopter techniques. This paper gives insight into how multi-surface environments can be designed to allow complementary use of and fluid switching between techniques.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Queen's University", "Queen's University", "Queen's University", "Queen's University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Matthew Oskamp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oskamp:Matthew", "Christophe Bortolaso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bortolaso:Christophe", "Robin Harrap.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrap:Robin", "T.
