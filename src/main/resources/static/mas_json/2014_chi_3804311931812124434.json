{"title": "SensaBubble: a chrono-sensory mid-air display of sight and smell.", "fields": ["bubble", "peripheral", "stimulus modality", "bursting", "sight"], "abstract": "We present SensaBubble, a  chrono-sensory  mid-air display system that generates scented bubbles to deliver information to the user via a number of sensory modalities. The system reliably produces single bubbles of specific sizes along a directed path. Each bubble produced by SensaBubble is filled with fog containing a scent relevant to the notification. The chrono-sensory aspect of SensaBubble means that information is presented both temporally and multimodally. Temporal information is enabled through two forms of persistence: firstly, a visual display projected onto the bubble which only endures until it bursts; secondly, a scent released upon the bursting of the bubble slowly disperses and leaves a longer-lasting perceptible trace of the event. We report details of SensaBubble's design and implementation, as well as results of technical and user evaluations. We then discuss and demonstrate how SensaBubble can be adapted for use in a wide range of application contexts -- from an ambient peripheral display for persistent alerts, to an engaging display for gaming or education.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "Lancaster University", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sue Ann Seah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seah:Sue_Ann", "Diego Mart\u00ednez Plasencia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plasencia:Diego_Mart=iacute=nez", "Peter D.
