{"title": "Harvesting Paragraph-level Question-Answer Pairs from Wikipedia.", "fields": ["natural language processing", "paragraph", "artificial neural network", "coreference", "sentence"], "abstract": "We study the task of generating from Wikipedia articles question-answer pairs that cover content beyond a single sentence. We propose a neural network approach that incorporates coreference knowledge via a novel gating mechanism. Compared to models that only take into account sentence-level information (Heilman and Smith, 2010; Du et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017), we find that the linguistic knowledge introduced by the coreference representation aids question generation significantly, producing models that outperform the current state-of-the-art. We apply our system (composed of an answer span extraction system and the passage-level QG system) to the 10,000 top-ranking Wikipedia articles and create a corpus of over one million question-answer pairs. We also provide a qualitative analysis for this large-scale generated corpus from Wikipedia.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Cornell University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Claire Cardie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cardie:Claire", "Xinya Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Xinya"], "pages": 11}
