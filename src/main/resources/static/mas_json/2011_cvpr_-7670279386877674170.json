We address the novel task of discovering first-person action categories (which we call ego-actions) which can be useful for such tasks as video indexing and retrieval. In order to learn ego-action categories, we investigate the use of motion-based histograms and unsupervised learning algorithms to quickly cluster video content. Our approach assumes a completely unsupervised scenario, where labeled training videos are not available, videos are not pre-segmented and the number of ego-action categories are unknown. In our proposed framework we show that a stacked Dirichlet process mixture model can be used to automatically learn a motion histogram codebook and the set of ego-action categories. We quantitatively evaluate our approach on both in-house and public YouTube videos and demonstrate robust ego-action categorization across several sports genres. Comparative analysis shows that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art topic models with respect to both classification accuracy and computational speed. Preliminary results indicate that on average, the categorical content of a 10 minute video sequence can be indexed in under 5 seconds.", "citation": "Citations (184)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "National Institute of Informatics", "UEC Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kris Makoto Kitani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kitani:Kris_Makoto", "Takahiro Okabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okabe:Takahiro", "Yoichi Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Yoichi", "Akihiro Sugimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugimoto:Akihiro"], "pages": 8}
