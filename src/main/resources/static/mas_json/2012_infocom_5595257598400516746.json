This is a well-known problem, called Maximum Lifetime Coverage Problem (MLCP), which has been studied extensively in the literature. It is a long-standing open problem whether MLCP has a polynomial-time constant-approximation. The best-known approximation algorithm has performance ratio 1 + ln n where n is the number of sensors in the network, which was given by Berman et. al [1]. In their work, MLCP is reduced to Minimum Weight Sensor Coverage Problem (MWSCP) which is to find the minimum total weight of sensors to cover a given area or a given set of targets with a given set of weighted sensors. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time (4 + \u2208)-approximation algorithm for MWSCP and hence we obtain a polynomial-time (4+\u03be)-approximation algorithm for MLCP, where \u2208 > 0, \u03be > 0.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Ling Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Ling", "Weili Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Weili", "James Willson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willson:James", "Lidong Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Lidong", "Zaixin Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zaixin", "Wonjun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wonjun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
