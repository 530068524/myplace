A technique of multispectral coded illumination (MSCI) with LED lights is proposed to defeat cameras capturing indoor scenes by inducing annoying color artifacts into the acquired images or video frames. The main idea of MSCI is to temporally modulate LED lights of different colors at certain frequencies so that they interfere with the rolling shutter of the camera, but at the same time the coded illumination appears to human eyes the same as steady white lighting.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["McMaster University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Xiao Shu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shu:Xiao", "Xiaolin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Xiaolin", "Qifan Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Qifan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
