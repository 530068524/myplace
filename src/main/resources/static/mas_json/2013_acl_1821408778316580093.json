{"title": "Argument Inference from Relevant Event Mentions in Chinese Argument Extraction.", "fields": ["natural language processing", "inference", "argument", "coreference", "sentence"], "abstract": "As a paratactic language, sentence-level argument extraction in Chinese suffers much from the frequent occurrence of ellipsis with regard to inter-sentence arguments. To resolve such problem, this paper proposes a novel global argument inference model to explore specific relationships, such as Coreference, Sequence and Parallel, among relevant event mentions to recover those intersentence arguments in the sentence, discourse and document layers which represent the cohesion of an event or a topic. Evaluation on the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus justifies the effectiveness of our global argument inference model over a state-of-the-art baseline.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Soochow University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Peifeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Peifeng", "Qiaoming Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Qiaoming", "Guodong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guodong"], "pages": 11}
