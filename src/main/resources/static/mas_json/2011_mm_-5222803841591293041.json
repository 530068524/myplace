However, these browsing orders, especially when the browsing speed is fast, ignore the vision persistency characteristic of human visual systems, which results in inconsistent visual experience for photo viewers. To address this issue, we construct a photo relationship graph based on various kinds of visual features that complementarily reflect human visual perception. Then the seeking of visually consistent photo browsing sequence is cast into a traveling salesman problem which seeks an optimal path with minimum visual distance within the graph structure. Experiment results on sequential browsing of Flickr photo groups indicate that the proposed method clearly beats the other sequential photo browsing methods in terms of visual consistency.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "National University of Singapore", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Dong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Dong", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng", "Hong-Jiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hong=Jiang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
