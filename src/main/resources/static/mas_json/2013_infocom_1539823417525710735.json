Real time applications require strict delay guarantee, i.e., a packet delayed beyond certain predefined value is dropped. Fortunately, depending on the codec used, real-time applications can sustain some loss gracefully. Aim of an admission control algorithm is to make sure that when a new flow is admitted, its and other existing flows' packet loss on account of deadline violation is below their respective acceptable limit. The problem of admission control has been studied extensively for wireline networks. However, this analysis does not extend to wireless case on account of fading. Here, we consider a wireless network with TDMA based MAC, and for this network obtain a scalable admission control algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "authors": ["Siddhant Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Siddhant", "Prasanna Chaporkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaporkar:Prasanna", "Rajan Udwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Udwani:Rajan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
