{"title": "La main des ma\u00eetres.", "fields": ["class conflict", "steampunk", "industrial revolution", "computer animation", "working class"], "abstract": "\"La Main des Maitres\" takes its graphical direction from the early 20th century's Art Nouveau and Victorian styles. Beneath the graphics is the society of the working class during the industrial revolution as it relates to class struggle. The major artistic influence on the overall animation style is the painter Alfons Mucha. From this inspiration, everything went to Steampunk, which contributed more craziness and freed the genre. The production culminated as a 2D animation short built with 3D animation tools in one year with a three-man team.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": [], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Adrien \"CaYuS\" Toupet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toupet:Adrien_=CaYuS="], "pages": 1}
