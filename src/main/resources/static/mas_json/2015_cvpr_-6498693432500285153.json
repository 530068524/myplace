{"title": "Structural Sparse Tracking.", "fields": ["sparse approximation", "eye tracking", "pattern recognition", "computer vision", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "Sparse representation has been applied to visual tracking by finding the best target candidate with minimal reconstruction error by use of target templates. However, most sparse representation based trackers only consider holistic or local representations and do not make full use of the intrinsic structure among and inside target candidates, thereby making the representation less effective when similar objects appear or under occlusion. In this paper, we propose a novel Structural Sparse Tracking (SST) algorithm, which not only exploits the intrinsic relationship among target candidates and their local patches to learn their sparse representations jointly, but also preserves the spatial layout structure among the local patches inside each target candidate. We show that our SST algorithm accommodates most existing sparse trackers with the respective merits. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging benchmark image sequences demonstrate that the proposed SST algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (140)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "National University of Singapore", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Institute of In ... ing, CAS, China", "Institute of Au ... ion, CAS, China"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tianzhu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tianzhu", "Si Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Si", "Changsheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Changsheng", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng", "Bernard Ghanem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghanem:Bernard", "Narendra Ahuja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahuja:Narendra", "Ming-Hsuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Ming=Hsuan"], "pages": 9}
