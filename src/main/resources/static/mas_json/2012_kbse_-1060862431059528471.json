{"title": "Adaptability of model comparison tools.", "fields": ["model based design", "specification language", "block diagram", "adaptability", "configuration management"], "abstract": "Modern model-based development methodologies require a large number of efficient, high-quality model comparison tools. They must be carefully adapted to the specific model type, user preferences and application context. Implementing a large number of dedicated, monolithic tools is infeasible, the only viable approach are generic, adaptable tools. Generic tools currently available provide only partial or low-quality solutions to this challenge; their results are not satisfactory for model types such as state machines or block diagrams. This paper presents the SiDiff approach to model comparison which includes a set of highly configurable incremental matchers and a specification language to control their application.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Timo Kehrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kehrer:Timo", "Udo Kelter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelter:Udo", "Pit Pietsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietsch:Pit", "Maik Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Maik"], "pages": 4}
