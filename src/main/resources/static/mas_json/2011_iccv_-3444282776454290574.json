In particular, we propose simple and easy to compute diagonal preconditioners for which convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed without the need to compute any step size parameters. As a by-product, we show that for a certain instance of the preconditioning, the proposed algorithm is equivalent to the old and widely unknown alternating step method for monotropic programming [7]. We show numerical results on general linear programming problems and a few standard computer vision problems. In all examples, the preconditioned algorithm significantly outperforms the algorithm of [5].", "citation": "Citations (305)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Thomas Pock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pock:Thomas", "Antonin Chambolle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chambolle:Antonin"], "pages": 8}
