In this work we present the task of making chit-chat more engaging by conditioning on profile information. We collect data and train models to (i) condition on their given profile information; and (ii) information about the person they are talking to, resulting in improved dialogues, as measured by next utterance prediction. Since (ii) is initially unknown our model is trained to engage its partner with personal topics, and we show the resulting dialogue can be used to predict profile information about the interlocutors.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Facebook", "City University of New York", "Facebook"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Douwe Kiela.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiela:Douwe", "Jason Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Jason", "Saizheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Saizheng", "Emily Dinan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinan:Emily", "Jack Urbanek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urbanek:Jack", "Arthur Szlam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szlam:Arthur"], "pages": 10}
