We construct an exact MCMC sampler for such systems by alternately sampling a random discretization of time given a trajectory of the system, and then a new trajectory given the discretization. The first step can be performed efficiently using properties of the Poisson process, while the second step can avail of discrete-time MCMC techniques based on the forward-backward algorithm. We show the advantage of our approach compared to particle MCMC and a uniformization-based sampler.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Vinayak Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Vinayak", "Yee Whye Teh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teh:Yee_Whye"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
