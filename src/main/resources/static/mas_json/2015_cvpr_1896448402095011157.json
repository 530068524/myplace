To generate realistic results without detailed geometric and reflectance measurements of the user, we propose to separate the image into intrinsic image layers and alter them according to proposed adaptations of physically-based reflectance models. Through this layer manipulation, the measured properties of cosmetic products are applied while preserving the appearance characteristics and lighting conditions of the target face. This approach is demonstrated on various forms of cosmetics including foundation, blush, lipstick, and eye shadow. Experimental results exhibit a close approximation to ground truth images, without artifacts such as transferred personal features and lighting effects that degrade the results of image-based makeup transfer methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chen", "Kun Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Kun", "Stephen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Stephen"], "pages": 9}
