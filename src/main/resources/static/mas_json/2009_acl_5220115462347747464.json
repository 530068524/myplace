However, n-gram based metrics are still today the dominant approach. The main reason is that the advantages of employing deeper linguistic information have not been clarified yet. In this work, we propose a novel approach for meta-evaluation of MT evaluation metrics, since correlation cofficient against human judges do not reveal details about the advantages and disadvantages of particular metrics. We then use this approach to investigate the benefits of introducing linguistic features into evaluation metrics. Overall, our experiments show that (i) both lexical and linguistic metrics present complementary advantages and (ii) combining both kinds of metrics yields the most robust metaevaluation performance.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["National University of Distance Education", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "National University of Distance Education", "National University of Distance Education"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Enrique Amig\u00f3.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amig=oacute=:Enrique", "Jes\u00fas Gim\u00e9nez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gim=eacute=nez:Jes=uacute=s", "Julio Gonzalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonzalo:Julio", "Felisa Verdejo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verdejo:Felisa"], "pages": 9}
