To mitigate this problem, we present  PaMpeR , a  p roof  m ethod  r ecommendation system for Isabelle/HOL. Given a proof state,  PaMpeR  recommends proof methods to discharge the proof goal and provides qualitative explanations as to why it suggests these methods.  PaMpeR  generates these recommendations based on existing hand-written proof corpora, thus transferring experienced users\u2019 expertise to new users. Our evaluation shows that  PaMpeR  correctly predicts experienced users\u2019 proof methods invocation especially when it comes to special purpose proof methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "University of Sydney"], "authors": ["Yutaka Nagashima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagashima:Yutaka", "Yilun He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yilun"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
