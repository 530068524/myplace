{"title": "Constrained Information-Theoretic Tripartite Graph Clustering to Identify Semantically Similar Relations.", "fields": ["correlation clustering", "canopy clustering algorithm", "clustering coefficient", "constrained clustering", "brown clustering"], "abstract": "In knowledge bases or information extraction results, differently expressed relations can be semantically similar (e.g., (X, wrote, Y) and (X, 's written work, Y)). Therefore, grouping semantically similar relations into clusters would facilitate and improve many applications, including knowledge base completion, information extraction, information retrieval, and more. This paper formulates relation clustering as a constrained tripartite graph clustering problem, presents an efficient clustering algorithm and exhibits the advantage of the constrained framework. We introduce several ways that provide side information via must-link and cannot-link constraints to improve the clustering results. Different from traditional semi-supervised learning approaches, we propose to use the similarity of relation expressions and the knowledge of entity types to automatically construct the constraints for the algorithm. We show improved relation clustering results on two datasets extracted from human annotated knowledge base (i.e., Freebase) and open information extraction results (i.e., ReVerb data).", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Peking University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Microsoft", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Chenguang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chenguang", "Yangqiu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yangqiu", "Dan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Dan", "Chi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Chi", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "Heng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Heng", "Ming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Ming"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
