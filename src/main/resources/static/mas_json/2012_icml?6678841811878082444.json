In particular, our results include: (I) we bound the gap between the solution matrix of the factorization method and the ground truth in terms of root mean square error; (II) we treat the matrix factorization as a subspace fitting problem and analyze the difference between the solution subspace and the ground truth; (III) we analyze the prediction error of individual users based on the subspace stability. We apply these results to the problem of collaborative filtering under manipulator attack, which leads to useful insights and guidelines for collaborative filtering system design.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yu-Xiang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yu=Xiang", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
