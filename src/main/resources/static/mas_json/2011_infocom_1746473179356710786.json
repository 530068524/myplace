The policies are restricted to the class of coordinate-convex policies. Two kinds of structural properties of the optimal policies and their robustness with respect to changes of the feasibility region are investigated: 1) general properties not depending on the revenue ratio associated with the two classes of users and 2) more specific properties depending on such a ratio. The results allow one to narrow the search for the optimal policies to a suitable subset of the set of coordinate-convex policies.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Genoa", "University of Genoa", "University of Genoa", "University of Genoa"], "authors": ["Mario Marchese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marchese:Mario", "Marco Cello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cello:Marco", "Giorgio Gnecco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gnecco:Giorgio", "Marcello Sanguineti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanguineti:Marcello"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
