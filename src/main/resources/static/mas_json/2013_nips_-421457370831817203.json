To reduce the amount of labeling necessary to learn good models, our algorithms operate with weakly labeled data and we query additional examples based on entropies of local marginals, which are a good surrogate for uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the task of 3D layout prediction from single images, and show that good models are learned when labeling only a handful of random variables. In particular, the same performance as using the full training set can be obtained while only labeling ~10% of the random variables.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "TTI, Chicago", "TTI, Chicago"], "authors": ["Wenjie Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Wenjie", "Alexander G.
