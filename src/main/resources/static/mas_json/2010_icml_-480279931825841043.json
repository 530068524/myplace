{"title": "Telling cause from effect based on high-dimensional observations.", "fields": ["matrix", "asymmetry", "covariance matrix", "gaussian", "curse of dimensionality"], "abstract": "We describe a method for inferring linear causal relations among multi-dimensional variables. The idea is to use an asymmetry between the distributions of cause and effect that occurs if the covariance matrix of the cause and the structure matrix mapping the cause to the effect are independently chosen. The method applies to both stochastic and deterministic causal relations, provided that the dimensionality is sufficiently high (in some experiments, 5 was enough). It is applicable to Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian data.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "University of Helsinki", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Dominik Janzing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Janzing:Dominik", "Patrik O.
