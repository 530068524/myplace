These properties are expressed in term of the variables at the interface of the components, and specify how a component interacts with its environment: the assumption is a property that must be satisfied by the environment of the component, while the guarantee is a property that the component must satisfy in response. Contract-based design has been recently proposed in many methodologies for taming the complexity of embedded systems. In fact, contract-based design enables stepwise refinement, compositional verification, and reuse of components. However, only few tools exist to support the formal verification underlying these methods.   OCRA (Othello Contracts Refinement Analysis) is a new tool that provides means for checking the refinement of contracts specified in a linear-time temporal logic. The specification language allows to express discrete as well as metric real-time constraints. The underlying reasoning engine allows checking if the contract refinement is correct. OCRA has been used in different projects and integrated in CASE tools.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["FBK-irst, Trento, Italy", "FBK-irst, Trento, Italy", "FBK-irst, Trento, Italy"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Alessandro Cimatti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cimatti:Alessandro", "Michele Dorigatti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dorigatti:Michele", "Stefano Tonetta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tonetta:Stefano"], "pages": 4}
