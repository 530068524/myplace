{"title": "Temporal alignment.", "fields": ["timestamp", "snapshot", "relational algebra", "joins", "temporal database"], "abstract": "In order to process interval timestamped data, the sequenced semantics has been proposed. This paper presents a relational algebra solution that provides native support for the three properties of the sequenced semantics: snapshot reducibility, extended snapshot reducibility, and change preservation. We introduce two temporal primitives,  temporal splitter  and  temporal aligner , and define rules that use these primitives to reduce the operators of a temporal algebra to their nontemporal counterparts. Our solution supports the three properties of the sequenced semantics through  interval adjustment  and  timestamp propagation . We have implemented the temporal primitives and reduction rules in the kernel of PostgreSQL to get native database support for processing interval timestamped data. The support is comprehensive and includes outer joins, antijoins, and aggregations with predicates and functions over the time intervals of argument relations. The implementation and empirical evaluation confirms effectiveness and scalability of our solution that leverages existing database query optimization techniques.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Anton Dign\u00f6s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dign=ouml=s:Anton", "Michael H.
