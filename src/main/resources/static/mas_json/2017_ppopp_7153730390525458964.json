To fully utilize the hardware, workloads spawn work to the GPU in bulk by launching large tasks, where each task is a kernel that contains thousands of threads that occupy the entire GPU.   GPUs face severe underutilization and their performance benefits vanish if the tasks are narrow, i.e., they contain    This paper presents Pagoda, a runtime system that virtualizes GPU resources, using an OS-like daemon kernel called MasterKernel. Tasks are spawned from the CPU onto Pagoda as they become available, and are scheduled by the MasterKernel at the warp granularity. Experimental results demonstrate that Pagoda achieves a geometric mean speedup of 5.70x over PThreads running on a 20-core CPU, 1.51x over CUDA-HyperQ, and 1.69x over GeMTC, the state-of- the-art runtime GPU task scheduling system.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Microsoft", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Tsung Tai Yeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeh:Tsung_Tai", "Amit Sabne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabne:Amit", "Putt Sakdhnagool.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakdhnagool:Putt", "Rudolf Eigenmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eigenmann:Rudolf", "Timothy G.
