{"title": "An automatic translation of tags for multimedia contents using folksonomy networks.", "fields": ["expression", "multimedia", "test set", "folksonomy", "metadata"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method to translate tags attached to multimedia contents for cross-language retrieval. The main issue in this problem is the sense disambiguation of tags given with few textual contexts. In order to solve this problem, the proposed method represents both tags and its translation candidates as networks of co-occurring tags since a network allows richer expression of contexts than other expressions such as co-occurrence vectors. The method translates a tag by selecting the optimal one from possible candidates based on a network similarity even when neither the textual contexts nor sophisticated language resources are available. The experiments on the MIR Flickr-2008 test set show that the proposed method achieves 90.44% accuracy in translating tags from English into German, which is significantly higher than the baseline methods of a frequency based translation and a co-occurrence-based translation.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Kyungpook National University", "Kyungpook National University", "Kyungpook National University", "Kyungpook National University", "Kyungpook National University"], "authors": ["Tae-Gil Noh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noh:Tae=Gil", "Seong-Bae Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Seong=Bae", "Hee-Geun Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Hee=Geun", "Sang-Jo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sang=Jo", "Se-Young Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Se=Young"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
