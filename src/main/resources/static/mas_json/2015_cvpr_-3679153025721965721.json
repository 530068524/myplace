{"title": "Completing 3D object shape from one depth image.", "fields": ["active shape model", "computer vision", "pattern recognition", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Our goal is to recover a complete 3D model from a depth image of an object. Existing approaches rely on user interaction or apply to a limited class of objects, such as chairs. We aim to fully automatically reconstruct a 3D model from any category. We take an exemplar-based approach: retrieve similar objects in a database of 3D models using view-based matching and transfer the symmetries and surfaces from retrieved models. We investigate completion of 3D models in three cases: novel view (model in database); novel model (models for other objects of the same category in database); and novel category (no models from the category in database).", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jason Rock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rock:Jason", "Tanmay Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Tanmay", "Justin Thorsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thorsen:Justin", "JunYoung Gwak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gwak:JunYoung", "Daeyun Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Daeyun", "Derek Hoiem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoiem:Derek"], "pages": 10}
