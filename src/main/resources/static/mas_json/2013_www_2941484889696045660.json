{"title": "Bitsquatting: exploiting bit-flips for fun, or profit?", "fields": ["typosquatting", "malware", "address bar", "internet traffic", "cybersquatting"], "abstract": "Over the last fifteen years, several types of attacks against domain names and the companies relying on them have been observed. The well-known cybersquatting of domain names gave way to typosquatting, the abuse of a user's mistakes when typing a URL in her browser's address bar. Recently, a new attack against domain names surfaced, namely bitsquatting. In bitsquatting, an attacker leverages random bit-errors occurring in the memory of commodity computers and smartphones, to redirect Internet traffic to attacker-controlled domains.   In this paper, we report on a large-scale experiment, measuring the adoption of bitsquatting by the domain-squatting community through the tracking of registrations of bitsquatting domains targeting popular web sites over a 9-month period. We show how new bitsquatting domains are registered daily and how attackers are trying to monetize their domains through the use of ads, abuse of affiliate programs and even malware installations. Lastly, given the discovered prevalence of bitsquatting, we review possible defense measures that companies, software developers and Internet Service Providers can use to protect against it.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Nick Nikiforakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikiforakis:Nick", "Steven Van Acker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acker:Steven_Van", "Wannes Meert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meert:Wannes", "Lieven Desmet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desmet:Lieven", "Frank Piessens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piessens:Frank", "Wouter Joosen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joosen:Wouter"], "conf": "www", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
