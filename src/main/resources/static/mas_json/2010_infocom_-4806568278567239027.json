To this end, hierarchical architectures provide a solution to this scalability problem. In this paper, we address the problem of design and optimization of a tiered wireless access network. At the lower tier, mesh routers are clustered based on traffic demands and delay requirements. The cluster heads are equipped with wireless optical transceivers and form the upper tier free space optical (FSO) network. We first present a plane sweeping and clustering algorithm aiming to minimize the number of clusters. PSC sweeps the network area and captures cluster members under delay and traffic load constraints. We then present an algebraic connectivity-based formulation for FSO network topology optimization and develop a greedy edge-appending algorithm that iteratively inserts edges to maximize algebraic connectivity. The proposed algorithms are analyzed and evaluated via simulations, and are shown to be highly effective as compared to the performance bounds derived in this paper.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Auburn University", "Auburn University"], "authors": ["In Keun Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:In_Keun", "Shiwen Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Shiwen"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
