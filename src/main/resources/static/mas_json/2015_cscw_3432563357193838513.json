{"title": "What to Expect When the Unexpected Happens: Social Media Communications Across Crises.", "fields": ["emergency management", "social media", "dissemination", "anecdotal evidence", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "The use of social media to communicate timely information during crisis situations has become a common practice in recent years. In particular, the one-to-many nature of Twitter has created an opportunity for stakeholders to disseminate crisis-relevant messages, and to access vast amounts of information they may not otherwise have. Our goal is to understand what affected populations, response agencies and other stakeholders can expect-and not expect-from these data in various types of disaster situations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that different types of crises elicit different reactions from Twitter users, but we have yet to see whether this is in fact the case. In this paper, we investigate several crises-including natural hazards and human-induced disasters-in a systematic manner and with a consistent methodology. This leads to insights about the prevalence of different information types and sources across a variety of crisis situations.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Alexandra Olteanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olteanu:Alexandra", "Sarah Vieweg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vieweg:Sarah", "Carlos Castillo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castillo_0001:Carlos"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 16}
