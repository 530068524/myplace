A lack of types in typical scripting languages means that programmers must (re)discover critical pieces of design information every time they wish to change a program. This analysis step both slows down the maintenance process and may even introduce mistakes due to the violation of undiscovered invariants.   This paper presents Typed Scheme, an explicitly typed extension of an untyped scripting language. Its type system is based on the novel notion of  occurrence typing , which we formalize and mechanically prove sound. The implementation of Typed Scheme additionally borrows elements from a range of approaches, including recursive types, true unions and subtyping, plus polymorphism combined with a modicum of local inference. Initial experiments with the implementation suggest that Typed Scheme naturally accommodates the programming style of the underlying scripting language, at least for the first few thousand lines of ported code.", "citation": "Citations (275)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Sam Tobin-Hochstadt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tobin=Hochstadt:Sam", "Matthias Felleisen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felleisen:Matthias"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
