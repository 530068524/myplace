These geo-textual data cover a wide range of topics. Users are interested in receiving up-to-date tweets such that their locations are close to a user specified location and their texts are interesting to users. For example, a user may want to be updated with tweets near her home on the topic \u201cfood poisoning vomiting.\u201d We consider the Temporal Spatial-Keyword Top-k Subscription (TaSK) query. Given a TaSK query, we continuously maintain up-to-date top-k most relevant results over a stream of geo-textual objects (e.g., geo-tagged Tweets) for the query. The TaSK query takes into account text relevance, spatial proximity, and recency of geo-textual objects in evaluating its relevance with a geo-textual object. We propose a novel solution to efficiently process a large number of TaSK queries over a stream of geotextual objects. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach on two real-world datasets and the experimental results show that our solution is able to achieve a reduction of the processing time by 70\u201380% compared with two baselines.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Queen's University Belfast", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Lisi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lisi", "Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao", "Xin Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xin", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
