{"title": "Four enhancements to automateddistributed system experimentation methods.", "fields": ["composability", "informatics", "planetlab", "software system", "testbed"], "abstract": "Experimentation is an essential tool employed by the developers of software systems, especially distributed systems. In prior work we developed a model-driven framework for automating various experimentation tasks, such as workload generation, and demonstrated that it gives the engineer a cost-effective means to conduct large-scale experiments on distributed testbeds. We have enhanced the methods underlying the framework in four significant ways: (1) increasing the  expressiveness  of workloads by allowing for conditional and reactive behaviors; (2) supporting the  repeatability  of experiments through the creation of environment workloads that can control the operational context; (3) enabling the  composability  of application and environment workloads to obtain a broader class of experiments; and (4) extending the  scope  of experiment management to include control over multiple runs. We use the enhancements to conduct a series of interesting new experiments. Specifically, the enhancements allow us to manipulate a fixed-wired testbed so that it simulates a mobile-wireless environment, and to selectively and maliciously inject faults into a system.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Lugano", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Yanyan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yanyan", "Antonio Carzaniga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carzaniga:Antonio", "Alexander L.
