The term full domain hash was first proposed by Bellare and Rogaway [BR93, BR96] and referred to a signature scheme from any trapdoor permutation that was part of their seminal work introducing the random oracle heuristic. Over time the term full domain hash has (informally) encompassed a broader range of notable cryptographic schemes including the Boneh-Franklin [BF01] IBE scheme and Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) [BLS01] signatures. All of the above described schemes required a hash function that had to be modeled as a random oracle to prove security. Our work utilizes recent advances in indistinguishability obfuscation to construct specific hash functions for use in these schemes. We then prove security of the original cryptosystems when instantiated with our specific hash function.", "citation": "Citations (126)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Susan Hohenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hohenberger:Susan", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit", "Brent Waters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waters:Brent"], "pages": 20}
