{"title": "A geodesic-preserving method for image warping.", "fields": ["image warping", "geometry", "computer vision", "ellipse", "geodesic"], "abstract": "The manipulation of panoramic/wide-angle images is usually achieved via image warping. Though various techniques have been developed for preserving shapes and straight lines for warping, these are not sufficient for panoramic/wide-angle images. The image projections will turn the straight lines into curved \u201cgeodesic lines\u201d, and it is fundamentally impossible to keep all these lines straight. In this work, we propose a geodesic-preserving method for content-aware image warping. An energy term is introduced to preserve the geodesic appearance of the geodesic lines, and can be used with shape-preserving terms. Our method is demonstrated in various applications, including rectangling panoramas, resizing panoramic/wide-angle images, and wide-angle image manipulation. An extension to ellipse preservation for general images is also presented.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dongping Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dongping", "Kaiming He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Kaiming", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian", "Kun Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Kun"], "pages": 9}
