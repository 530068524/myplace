{"title": "Promoting Hotkey use through rehearsal with ExposeHK.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "empirical research", "exploit", "pointer", "toolbar"], "abstract": "Keyboard shortcuts allow fast interaction, but they are known to be infrequently used, with most users relying heavily on traditional pointer-based selection for most commands. We describe the goals, design, and evaluation of ExposeHK, a new interface mechanism that aims to increase hotkey use. ExposeHK's four key design goals are: 1) enable users to browse hotkeys; 2) allow non-expert users to issue hotkey commands as a physical rehearsal of expert performance; 3) exploit spatial memory to assist non-expert users in identifying hotkeys; and 4) maximise expert performance by using consistent shortcuts in a flat command hierarchy. ExposeHK supports these objectives by displaying hotkeys overlaid on their associated commands when a modifier key is pressed. We evaluated ExposeHK in three empirical studies using toolbars, menus, and a tabbed \\'18ribbon' toolbar. Results show that participants used more hotkeys, and used them more often, with ExposeHK than with other techniques; they were faster with ExposeHK than with either pointing or other hotkey methods; and they strongly preferred ExposeHK. Our research shows that ExposeHK can substantially improve the user's transition from a \\'18beginner mode' of interaction to a higher level of expertise.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of Canterbury", "Telekom Innovation Laboratories", "University of Canterbury", "University of Canterbury", "University of Saskatchewan"], "authors": ["Sylvain Malacria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malacria:Sylvain", "Gilles Bailly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailly:Gilles", "Joel Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Joel", "Andy Cockburn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cockburn:Andy", "Carl Gutwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gutwin:Carl"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
