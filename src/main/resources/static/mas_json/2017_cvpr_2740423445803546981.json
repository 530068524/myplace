The proposed method addresses an important problem of video understanding: how to build a video representation that incorporates the CNN features over the entire video. Feature assignment is carried out at two levels, by using the similarity and spatio-temporal information. For each assignment we build a specific encoding, focused on the nature of deep features, with the goal to capture the highest feature responses from the highest neuron activation of the network. Our ST-VLMPF clearly provides a more reliable video representation than some of the most widely used and powerful encoding approaches (Improved Fisher Vectors and Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors), while maintaining a low computational complexity. We conduct experiments on three action recognition datasets: HMDB51, UCF50 and UCF101. Our pipeline obtains state-of-the-art results.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Trento", "Politehnica University of Bucharest", "University of Tokyo", "University of Trento"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ionut Cosmin Duta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duta:Ionut_Cosmin", "Bogdan Ionescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ionescu:Bogdan", "Kiyoharu Aizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aizawa:Kiyoharu", "Nicu Sebe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebe:Nicu"], "pages": 10}
