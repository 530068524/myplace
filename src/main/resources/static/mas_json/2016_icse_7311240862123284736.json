We evaluate our proposed algorithm on three different alternative formulations, baseline comparators and current state-of-the-art effort estimators applied to five real-world datasets from the PROMISE repository, involving 724 different software projects in total. The results reveal that our algorithm outperforms the baseline, state-of-the-art and all three alternative formulations, statistically significantly ( p   \u00c2  12  \u2265 0.9) over all five datasets. We also provide evidence that our algorithm creates a new state-of-the-art, which lies within currently claimed industrial human-expert-based thresholds, thereby demonstrating that our findings have actionable conclusions for practicing software engineers.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University College London", "University of Portsmouth", "University College London"], "authors": ["Federica Sarro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarro:Federica", "Alessio Petrozziello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrozziello:Alessio", "Mark Harman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harman:Mark"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
