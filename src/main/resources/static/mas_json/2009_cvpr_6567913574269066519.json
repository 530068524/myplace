{"title": "Multi-camera activity correlation analysis.", "fields": ["image segmentation", "temporal resolution", "object detection", "network topology", "canonical correlation"], "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for modelling correlations between activities in a busy public space captured by multiple non-overlapping and uncalibrated cameras. In our approach, each camera view is automatically decomposed into semantic regions, across which different spatio-temporal activity patterns are observed. A novel Cross Canonical Correlation Analysis (xCCA) framework is formulated to detect and quantify temporal and causal relationships between regional activities within and across camera views. The approach accomplishes three tasks: (1) estimate the spatial and temporal topology of the camera network; (2) facilitate more robust and accurate person re-identification; (3) perform global activity modelling and video temporal segmentation by linking visual evidence collected across camera views. Our approach differs from the state of the art in that it does not rely on either intra or inter camera tracking. It therefore can be applied to even the most challenging video surveillance settings featured with severe occlusions and extremely low spatial and temporal resolutions. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using 153 hours of videos from 8 cameras installed in a busy underground station.", "citation": "Citations (214)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chen Change Loy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loy:Chen_Change", "Tao Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Tao", "Shaogang Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Shaogang"], "pages": 8}
