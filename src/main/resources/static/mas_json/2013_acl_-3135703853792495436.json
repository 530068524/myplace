We evaluate its performance on a creative sentence generation task, showing its capability of generating well-formed, catchy and effective sentences that have all the good qualities of slogans produced by human copywriters.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["fondazione bruno kessler", "University of Trento", "fondazione bruno kessler"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["G\u00f6zde \u00d6zbal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ouml=zbal:G=ouml=zde", "Daniele Pighin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pighin:Daniele", "Carlo Strapparava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strapparava:Carlo"], "pages": 10}
