{"title": "Engineering adaptive privacy: on the role of privacy awareness requirements.", "fields": ["selective disclosure", "exploit", "personally identifiable information", "privacy by design", "privacy software"], "abstract": "Applications that continuously gather and disclose personal information about users are increasingly common. While disclosing this information may be essential for these applications to function, it may also raise privacy concerns. Partly, this is due to frequently changing context that introduces new privacy threats, and makes it difficult to continuously satisfy privacy requirements. To address this problem, applications may need to adapt in order to manage changing privacy concerns. Thus, we propose a framework that exploits the notion of privacy awareness requirements to identify runtime privacy properties to satisfy. These properties are used to support disclosure decision making by applications. Our evaluations suggest that applications that fail to satisfy privacy awareness requirements cannot regulate users' information disclosure. We also observe that the satisfaction of privacy awareness requirements is useful to users aiming to minimise exposure to privacy threats, and to users aiming to maximise functional benefits amidst increasing threat severity.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Limerick", "University of Limerick", "University of Limerick", "University of Limerick"], "authors": ["Inah Omoronyia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Omoronyia:Inah", "Luca Cavallaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cavallaro:Luca", "Mazeiar Salehie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salehie:Mazeiar", "Liliana Pasquale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasquale:Liliana", "Bashar Nuseibeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nuseibeh:Bashar"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
