{"title": "Learning Policies for Contextual Submodular Prediction.", "fields": ["trajectory optimization", "automatic summarization", "realizability", "manipulator", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "Many prediction domains, such as ad placement, recommendation, trajectory prediction, and document summarization, require predicting a set or list of options. Such lists are often evaluated using submodular reward functions that measure both quality and diversity. We propose a simple, efficient, and provably near-optimal approach to optimizing such prediction problems based on noregret learning. Our method leverages a surprising result from online submodular optimization: a single no-regret online learner can compete with an optimal sequence of predictions. Compared to previous work, which either learn a sequence of classifiers or rely on stronger assumptions such as realizability, we ensure both data-efficiency as well as performance guarantees in the fully agnostic setting. Experiments validate the efficiency and applicability of the approach on a wide range of problems including manipulator trajectory optimization, news recommendation and document summarization.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["St\u00e9phane Ross.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ross:St=eacute=phane", "Jiaji Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Jiaji", "Yisong Yue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yue:Yisong", "Debadeepta Dey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dey:Debadeepta", "Drew Bagnell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagnell:Drew"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
