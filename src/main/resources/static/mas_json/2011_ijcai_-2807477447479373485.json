{"title": "First-Order Extension of the FLP Stable Model Semantics via Modified Circumscription.", "fields": ["well founded semantics", "circumscription", "expression", "operational semantics", "stable model semantics"], "abstract": "We provide reformulations and generalizations of both the semantics of logic programs by Faber, Leone and Pfeifer and its extension to arbitrary propositional formulas by Truszczynski. Unlike the previous definitions, our generalizations refer neither to grounding nor to fixpoints, and apply to first-order formulas containing aggregate expressions. In the same spirit as the first-order stable model semantics proposed by Ferraris, Lee and Lifschitz, the semantics proposed here are based on syntactic transformations that are similar to circumscription. The reformulations provide useful insights into the FLP semantics and its relationship to circumscription and the first-order stable model semantics.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Michael Bartholomew.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartholomew:Michael", "Joohyung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joohyung", "Yunsong Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Yunsong"], "pages": 7}
