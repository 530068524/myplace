We demonstrate how algorithms for optimizing tensor networks can be adapted to supervised learning tasks by using matrix product states (tensor trains) to parameterize non-linear kernel learning models. For the MNIST data set we obtain less than 1% test set classification error. We discuss an interpretation of the additional structure imparted by the tensor network to the learned model.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Edwin Miles Stoudenmire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoudenmire:Edwin_Miles", "David J.
