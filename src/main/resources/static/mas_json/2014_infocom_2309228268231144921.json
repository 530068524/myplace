The analysis of DPS is extremely challenging and analytical results are scarce. We develop closed-form approximations for the mean conditional and unconditional sojourn times. The main benefits of the approximations lie in its simplicity, the fact that it applies for general service requirements with finite second moments, and that it provides insights into the dependency of the performance on the system parameters. We show that the approximation for the mean (un)conditional sojourn time of a customer is decreasing as its relative priority increases. We also show that the approximation is exact in various scenarios, and that it is uniformly bounded in the second moments of the service requirements. Finally we numerically illustrate that the approximation is accurate across a broad range of parameters.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["LAAS, Toulouse, France", "LAAS, Toulouse, France", "IRIT, Toulouse, France"], "authors": ["Ane Izagirre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izagirre:Ane", "Urtzi Ayesta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ayesta:Urtzi", "Ina Maria Verloop.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verloop:Ina_Maria"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
