Topological persistence, or persistent homology, appears as a fundamental tool in this field. In this paper, we study topological persistence in general metric spaces, with a statistical approach. We show that the use of persistent homology can be naturally considered in general statistical frameworks and that persistence diagrams can be used as statistics with interesting convergence properties. Some numerical experiments are performed in various contexts to illustrate our results.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Burgundy", "University of Burgundy", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University", "Institut de Mat ... urgogne, France"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chazal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chazal:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Marc Glisse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glisse:Marc", "Catherine Labru\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Labru=egrave=re:Catherine", "Bertrand Michel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michel:Bertrand"], "pages": 9}
