It is then shown how to obtain a weighted local multi bottom-up tree transducer from a bilingual and biparsed corpus. Finally, the problem of non-preservation of regularity is addressed. Three properties that ensure preservation are introduced, and it is discussed how to adjust the rule extraction process such that they are automatically fulfilled.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Andreas Maletti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maletti:Andreas"], "pages": 10}
