As far as we know, this is the first automated formal analysis of a secure storage protocol. The protocol, designed as the basis for the file system Plutus, features a number of interesting schemes like lazy revocation and key rotation. These schemes improve the protocol's performance, but complicate its security properties. Our analysis clarifies several ambiguities in the design and reveals some unknown attacks on the protocol. We propose corrections, and prove precise security guarantees for the corrected protocol.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Bruno Blanchet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanchet:Bruno", "Avik Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Avik"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2008", "pages": 15}
