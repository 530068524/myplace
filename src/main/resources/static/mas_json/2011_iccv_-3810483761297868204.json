From our knowledge, this is the first time that this problem is addressed taken into account different object classes simultaneously. Given several images of the scene taken from different angles, our system estimates the ground plane location of the objects from the output of several object detectors applied at each viewpoint. We cast the problem as an energy minimization modeled with a Conditional Random Field (CRF). Instead of predicting the presence of an object at each image location independently, we simultaneously predict the labeling of the entire scene. Our CRF is able to take into account occlusions between objects and contextual constraints among them. We propose an effective iterative strategy that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem, and learn the parameters of the model with the max-margin paradigm. We evaluate the performance of our model on several challenging multi-camera pedestrian detection datasets namely PETS 2009 [5] and EPFL terrace sequence [9]. We also introduce a new dataset in which multiple classes of objects appear simultaneously in the scene. It is here where we show that our method effectively handles occlusions in the multi-class case.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Gemma Roig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roig:Gemma", "Xavier Boix.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boix:Xavier", "Horesh Ben Shitrit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shitrit:Horesh_Ben", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal"], "pages": 8}
