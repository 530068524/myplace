We use recent approaches that reduce these problems to safety games, and can be solved efficiently by symbolic incremental algorithms based on antichains. The reduction to safety games offers very interesting properties in practice: the construction of compact solutions (when they exist) and a compositional approach for large conjunctions of LTL formulas.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Mons", "University of Mons", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Synopsys", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Aaron Bohy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bohy:Aaron", "V\u00e9ronique Bruy\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruy=egrave=re:V=eacute=ronique", "Emmanuel Filiot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filiot:Emmanuel", "Naiyong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Naiyong", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raskin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raskin:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 6}
