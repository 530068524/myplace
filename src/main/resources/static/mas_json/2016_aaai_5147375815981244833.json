The team won all of its six games, scoring a total of 48 goals and conceding 0. This unprecedented dominant performance is the result of various features, but we particularly credit our novel offense multi-robot coordination. This paper thus presents our Selectively Reactive Coordination (SRC) algorithm, consisting of two layers: A coordinated opponent-agnostic layer enables the team to create its own plans, setting the pace of the game in offense. An individual opponent-reactive action selection layer enables the robots to maintain reactivity to different opponents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our coordination through results from RoboCup 2015, and through controlled experiments using a physics-based simulator and an automated referee.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Juan Pablo Mendoza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mendoza:Juan_Pablo", "Joydeep Biswas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biswas:Joydeep", "Philip Cooksey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cooksey:Philip", "Richard Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Richard", "Steven D.
