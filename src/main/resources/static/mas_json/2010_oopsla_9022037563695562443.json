The difficulty, according to common interpretations, comes from the communication and organizational problems in software development. But the story contains one more important lesson that people tend to miss: one cannot accomplish  impossible  goals, which programmers are often asked to do. Software engineering, as a discipline, can overcome poor communication; but as long as we attempt to live up to impossible expectations, we will always fail.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Booz Allen Hamilton", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Paul Adamczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adamczyk:Paul", "Munawar Hafiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hafiz:Munawar"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2010", "pages": 11}
