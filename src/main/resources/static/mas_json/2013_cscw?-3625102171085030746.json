However, digital tools for enabling these ways of working, especially for geographically distributed teams, have still not been adopted in these companies. We present Tele-Board, a web-based digital whiteboard and sticky note system and describe how it was used in a large company at three locations. From system log data and interviews recorded after three months of use, we found that idea generation and feedback collection can be facilitated if a system offers real-time synchronous editing as well as asynchronous input. Interestingly, the users who were  not  located at the company's headquarters regarded the tool as very beneficial and used it more than their colleagues at the headquarters. We provide a detailed analysis of the study and important points for fostering the adoption of creative tools in large companies.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "authors": ["Raja Gumienny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gumienny:Raja", "Lutz Gericke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gericke:Lutz", "Matthias Wenzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wenzel:Matthias", "Christoph Meinel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meinel:Christoph"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 13}
