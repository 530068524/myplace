The construction of the proof of non-termination is guided by the generation of quasi-invariants \u0097 properties such that if they hold at a location during execution once, then they will continue to hold at that location from then onwards. The check that quasi-invariants can indeed be reached is then performed separately. Our technique considers strongly connected subgraphs of a program's control flow graph for analysis and thus produces more generic witnesses of non-termination than existing methods. Moreover, it can handle programs with unbounded non-determinism and is more likely to converge than previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "University College London", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Daniel Larraz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larraz:Daniel", "Kaustubh Nimkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nimkar:Kaustubh", "Albert Oliveras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveras:Albert", "Enric Rodr\u00edguez-Carbonell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodr=iacute=guez=Carbonell:Enric", "Albert Rubio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubio:Albert"], "pages": 18}
