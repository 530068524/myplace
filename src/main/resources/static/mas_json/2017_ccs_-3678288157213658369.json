Our constructions achieve adaptive security, are based on standard assumptions and achieve significant efficiency gains compared to previous constructions.   Our constructions rely on a generic transformation from inner product functional encryption (IPFE) schemes to trace-and-revoke systems. Our transformation requires the underlying IPFE scheme to only satisfy a very weak notion of security -- the attacker may only request a bounded number of  random  keys -- in contrast to the standard notion of security where she may request an unbounded number of arbitrarily chosen keys. We exploit the much weaker security model to provide a new construction for bounded collusion and random key IPFE from the learning with errors assumption (LWE), which enjoys improved efficiency compared to the scheme of Agrawal  et al.  [CRYPTO'16].   Together with IPFE schemes from Agrawal  et al. , we obtain trace and revoke from LWE, Decision Diffie Hellman and Decision Composite Residuosity.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Madras", "Indian Statistical Institute", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Shweta Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Shweta", "Sanjay Bhattacherjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacherjee:Sanjay", "Duong Hieu Phan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phan:Duong_Hieu", "Damien Stehl\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stehl=eacute=:Damien", "Shota Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada_0001:Shota"], "pages": 17}
