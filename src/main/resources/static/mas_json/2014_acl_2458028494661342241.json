{"title": "Probabilistic Soft Logic for Semantic Textual Similarity.", "fields": ["rule of inference", "logical conjunction", "probabilistic logic", "semantic similarity", "psl"], "abstract": "Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) is a recently developed framework for probabilistic logic. We use PSL to combine logical and distributional representations of natural-language meaning, where distributional information is represented in the form of weighted inference rules. We apply this framework to the task of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) (i.e. judging the semantic similarity of naturallanguage sentences), and show that PSL gives improved results compared to a previous approach based on Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) and a purely distributional approach.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Linguistics"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Islam Beltagy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beltagy:Islam", "Katrin Erk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erk:Katrin", "Raymond J.
