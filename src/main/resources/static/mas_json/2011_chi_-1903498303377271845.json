Inspired by this medium, we have developed a new multi-touch digital artistic medium named  SandCanvas  that simplifies the creation of sand animations.  SandCanvas  also goes beyond traditional sand animation with tools for mixing sand animation with video and replicating recorded free-form hand gestures. In this paper, we analyze common sand animation hand gestures, present  SandCanvas 's intuitive UI, and describe implementation challenges we encountered. We also present an evaluation with professional and novice artists that shows the importance and unique affordances of this new medium.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Singapore Management University", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rubaiat Habib Kazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazi:Rubaiat_Habib", "Kien Chuan Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Kien_Chuan", "Shengdong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shengdong", "Richard C.
