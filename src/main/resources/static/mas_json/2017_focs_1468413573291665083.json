{"title": "Quantum SDP-Solvers: Better Upper and Lower Bounds.", "fields": ["quantum algorithm", "quantum sort", "quantum complexity theory", "quantum phase estimation algorithm", "quantum capacity"], "abstract": "Brand\u00e3o and Svore recently gave quantum algorithms for approximately solving semidefinite programs, which in some regimes are faster than the best-possible classical algorithms in terms of the dimension n of the problem and the number m of constraints, but worse in terms of various other parameters. In this paper we improve their algorithms in several ways, getting better dependence on those other parameters. To this end we develop new techniques for quantum algorithms, for instance a general way to efficiently implement smooth functions of sparse Hamiltonians, and a generalized minimum-finding procedure.We also show limits on this approach to quantum SDP-solvers, for instance for combinatorial optimizations problems that have a lot of symmetry. Finally, we prove some general lower bounds showing that in the worst case, the complexity of every quantum LP-solver (and hence also SDP-solver) has to scale linearly with mn when m is approximately n, which is the same as classical.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Joran van Apeldoorn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apeldoorn:Joran_van", "Andr\u00e1s Gily\u00e9n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gily=eacute=n:Andr=aacute=s", "Sander Gribling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gribling:Sander", "Ronald de Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Ronald_de"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
