{"title": "Fast Mencius: Mencius with low commit latency.", "fields": ["commit", "replica", "crash", "latency", "state machine replication"], "abstract": "Mencius is a protocol for general state machine replication that tolerates crash failures. It has high performance in wide-area networks. However, the commit latency of Mencius is limited by the slowest replica. This paper presents Fast Mencius, a crash fault-tolerant state machine replication protocol, which enhances Mencius with Active Revoke and Multi-instance Propose. Active Revoke allows the non-slow replicas to proceed without being delayed by the slowest replica, while Multi-instance Propose enables the slow replicas to have their proposals chosen by the replicated state machine. Our evaluation shows that in presence of slow replicas, Fast Mencius's commit latency is significantly lower than that of Mencius, and it also achieves high throughput.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Wei Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Wei", "Harry Tian Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Harry_Tian", "Fengyuan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Fengyuan", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
