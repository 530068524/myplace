{"title": "Aligning Opinions: Cross-Lingual Opinion Mining with Dependencies.", "fields": ["data mining", "sentiment analysis", "labeled data", "integer programming", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We propose a cross-lingual framework for fine-grained opinion mining using bitext projection. The only requirements are a running system in a source language and word-aligned parallel data. Our method projects opinion frames from the source to the target language, and then trains a system on the target language using the automatic annotations. Key to our approach is a novel dependency-based model for opinion mining, which we show, as a byproduct, to be on par with the current state of the art for English, while avoiding the need for integer programming or reranking. In cross-lingual mode (English to Portuguese), our approach compares favorably to a supervised system (with scarce labeled data), and to a delexicalized model trained using universal tags and bilingual word embeddings.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Coimbra", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mariana S.
