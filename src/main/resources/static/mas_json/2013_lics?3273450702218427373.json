Hirshfeld and Rabinovich have shown that over the reals, firstorder logic with binary order relation <; and unary function +1 is strictly more expressive than MTL with integer constants. Indeed they prove that no temporal logic whose modalities are definable by formulas of bounded quantifier depth can be expressively complete for FO(<;, +1). In this paper we show that if we allow unary functions +q, q \u2208 Q, in first-order logic and correspondingly allow rational constants in MTL, then the two logics have the same expressive power. This gives the first generalisation of Kamp's theorem on the expressive completeness of LTL for FO(<;) to the quantitative setting. The proof of this result involves a generalisation of Gabbay's notion of separation to the metric setting.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Paul Hunter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hunter:Paul", "Jo\u00ebl Ouaknine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouaknine:Jo=euml=l", "James Worrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Worrell_0001:James"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
