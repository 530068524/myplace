In these contexts, it is beneficial to provide these oracle mechanisms with multiple highly likely hypotheses rather than a single prediction. In this work, we pose the task of producing multiple outputs as a learning problem over an ensemble of deep networks -- introducing a novel stochastic gradient descent based approach to minimize the loss with respect to an oracle. Our method is simple to implement, agnostic to both architecture and loss function, and parameter-free. Our approach achieves lower oracle error compared to existing methods on a wide range of tasks and deep architectures. We also show qualitatively that solutions produced from our approach often provide interpretable representations of task ambiguity.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Indiana University", "Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati", "Virginia Tech", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Stefan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Stefan", "Senthil Purushwalkam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Purushwalkam:Senthil", "Michael Cogswell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cogswell:Michael", "Viresh Ranjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranjan:Viresh", "David J.
