Our main tools are suitable notions of bisimulation. While an elegant notion of bisimulation exists for N\u2286, the required bisimulation for N= is rather involved. We propose a simple extension of N= with a universal modality that we call N=(E), which comes together with a natural notion of bisimulation. We also investigate the complexity of the satisfiability problem for N\u2286 and N=(E).", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan"], "authors": ["Carlos Areces.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Areces:Carlos", "Diego Figueira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Figueira:Diego"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
