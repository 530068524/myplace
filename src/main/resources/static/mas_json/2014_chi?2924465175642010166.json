The input and display can have different sizes and aspect ratios, for example. The on-screen targets can vary in size. Users can look solely at the display or at the input device as well. They can also hold the input device in certain cases, or let it rest on a table. This paper reports on two experiments designed to investigate the influence of all these factors on absolute indirect-touch pointing performance. We also provide design guidelines for interaction in these situations based on the observed impacting factors.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "university of lille", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Gilliot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilliot:J=eacute=r=eacute=mie", "G\u00e9ry Casiez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casiez:G=eacute=ry", "Nicolas Roussel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roussel:Nicolas"], "pages": 10}
