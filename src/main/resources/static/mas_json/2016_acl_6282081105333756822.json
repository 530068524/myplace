Putting Numbers in Perspective with Compositional Descriptions.", "fields": ["bleu", "natural language processing", "knowledge base", "recurrent neural network", "natural language"], "abstract": "How much is 131 million US dollars? To help readers put such numbers in context, we propose a new task of automatically generating short descriptions known as perspectives, e.g. \"$131 million is about the cost to employ everyone in Texas over a lunch period\". First, we collect a dataset of numeric mentions in news articles, where each mention is labeled with a set of rated perspectives. We then propose a system to generate these descriptions consisting of two steps: formula construction and description generation. In construction, we compose formulae from numeric facts in a knowledge base and rank the resulting formulas based on familiarity, numeric proximity and semantic compatibility. In generation, we convert a formula into natural language using a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network. Our system obtains a 15.2% F1 improvement over a non-compositional baseline at formula construction and a 12.5 BLEU point improvement over a baseline description generation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Arun Tejasvi Chaganty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaganty:Arun_Tejasvi", "Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy"], "pages": -1}
