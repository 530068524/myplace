The schemes/protocols achieving those tradeoffs in an effective and decentralized way are proposed and the optimality of those tradeoffs is established. The scenarios in which network coding can provide significant improvement on network performance are identified under different node mobility patterns (fast and slow mobility). The insights on when and how information mixing is beneficial for MANETs with multiple unicast and multicast sessions are provided. As far as we know, this is the first work characterizing scaling laws of throughput and delay of MANETs with network coding.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "Xidian University"], "authors": ["Chi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Chi", "Yuguang Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Yuguang", "Xiaoyan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoyan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
