We propose an enhanced two-stage EB router which maximizes throughput by achieving a 42% reduction in cycle time and 20% reduction in occupied area by using look-ahead routing and replacing the three-slot output EBs in the baseline router of [17] with two-slot EBs. We also propose a singlestage router which merges the two pipeline stages to avoid pipelining overhead. This design reduces zero-load latency by 24% compared to the enhanced two-stage router if both are operated at the same clock frequency; moreover, the single-stage router reduces the required energy per transferred bit and occupied area by 29% and 30% respectively, compared to the enhanced two-stage router. However, the cycle time of the enhanced two-stage router is 26% smaller than that of the single-stage router.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["George Michelogiannakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michelogiannakis:George", "William J.
