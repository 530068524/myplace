{"title": "ENKI: Access Control for Encrypted Query Processing.", "fields": ["encryption", "outsourcing", "key", "multi user", "use case"], "abstract": "A data owner outsourcing the database of a multi user application wants to prevent information leaks caused by outside attackers exploiting software vulnerabilities or by curious personnel. Query processing over encrypted data solves this problem for a single user, but provides only limited functionality in the face of access restrictions for multiple users and keys. ENKI is a system for securely executing queries over sensitive, access restricted data on an outsourced database. It introduces an encryption based access control model and techniques for query execution over encrypted, access restricted data on the database with only a few cases requiring computations on the client. A prototype of ENKI supports all queries seen in three real world use cases and executes queries from TPC-C benchmark with a modest overhead compared to the single user mode.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Milan", "SAP AG, Karlsruhe, Germany"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Isabelle Hang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hang:Isabelle", "Florian Kerschbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kerschbaum:Florian", "Ernesto Damiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damiani:Ernesto"], "pages": 14}
