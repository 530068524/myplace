However, related work is relatively scarce. In this paper, we present an effective approach to decrease both the deadline miss ratio and power consumption by merging similar real-time transactions, while systematically adapting the data freshness. In a simulation study, our approach considerably reduces deadline misses and power consumptions compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, supporting the required data freshness.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Binghamton University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Kyoung-Don Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Kyoung=Don"], "pages": 12}
