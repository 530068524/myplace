{"title": "Visual Sentiment Analysis by Attending on Local Image Regions.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "human visual system model", "visual perception", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Visual sentiment analysis, which studies the emotional response of humans on visual stimuli such as images and videos, has been an interesting and challenging problem. It tries to understand the high-level content of visual data. The success of current models can be attributed to the development of robust algorithms from computer vision. Most of the existing models try to solve the problem by proposing either robust features or more complex models. In particular, visual features from the whole image or video are the main proposed inputs. Little attention has been paid to local areas, which we believe is pretty relevant to human's emotional response to the whole image. In this work, we study the impact of local image regions on visual sentiment analysis. Our proposed model utilizes the recent studied attention mechanism to jointly discover the relevant local regions and build a sentiment classifier on top of these local regions. The experimental results suggest that 1) our model is capable of automatically discovering sentimental local regions of given images and 2) it outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms to visual sentiment analysis.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "Adobe Systems", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Quanzeng You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Quanzeng", "Hailin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Hailin", "Jiebo Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jiebo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
