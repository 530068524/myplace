Facial modeling needs enormous efforts to achieve immersive experience in applications like avatar chatting or online makeover. Great challenge exists in robust detection of 2D facial prominent points and mapping them to 3D models in a parameterized manner. Another challenge is how to characterize semantic components of eyes, mouth, nose, and cheek rather than low level mesh geometries. In this paper, we proposed an augmented makeover framework to deal with aforementioned challenges. Aiming to provide amateurs with flexible customizations, morphable model is constructed from a set of scanned 3D face data set. Appearance personalization is carried out in the offline phase where single image and multiple views are discussed respectively to generate deformative shape in a progressive manner. Augmentation is implemented in the online phase where a fast and robust 3D tracking is used to balance the tradeoff between accuracy and real-time requirements. By this means, immersive Human Computer Interaction such as virtual makeover and photo-realistic avatar chatting could be achieved.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Patricia P.
