{"title": "Hyrise-R: Scale-out and Hot-Standby through Lazy Master Replication for Enterprise Applications.", "fields": ["web cache", "query throughput", "snapshot", "hot spare", "scalability"], "abstract": "In-memory database systems are well-suited for enterprise workloads, consisting of transactional and analytical queries. A growing number of users and an increasing demand for enterprise applications can saturate or even overload single-node database systems at peak times. Better performance can be achieved by improving a single machine's hardware but it is often cheaper and more practicable to follow a scale-out approach and replicate data by using additional machines.   In this paper we present Hyrise-R, a lazy master replication system for the in-memory database Hyrise. By setting up a snapshot-based Hyrise cluster, we increase both performance by distributing queries over multiple instances and availability by utilizing the redundancy of the cluster structure. This paper describes the architecture of Hyrise-R and details of the implemented replication mechanisms. We set up Hyrise-R on instances of Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud and present a detailed performance evaluation of our system, including a linear query throughput increase for enterprise workloads.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "authors": ["David Schwalb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwalb:David", "Jan Kossmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kossmann:Jan", "Martin Faust.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faust:Martin", "Stefan Klauck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klauck:Stefan", "Matthias Uflacker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uflacker:Matthias", "Hasso Plattner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plattner:Hasso"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
