However, currently all known constructions of IO are based on multilinear maps which are poorly understood. Hence, tremendous research effort has been put towards basing obfuscation on better-understood computational assumptions. Recently, another path to IO has emerged through functional encryption [Anath and Jain, CRYPTO 2015; Bitansky and Vaikuntanathan, FOCS 2015] but such FE schemes currently are still based on multi-linear maps. In this work, we study whether IO could be based on other powerful encryption primitives.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Sanjam Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Sanjam", "Mohammad Mahmoody.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahmoody:Mohammad", "Ameer Mohammed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohammed:Ameer"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 35}
