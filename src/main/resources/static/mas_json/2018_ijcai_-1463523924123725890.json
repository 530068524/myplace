{"title": "Lifted Filtering via Exchangeable Decomposition.", "fields": ["rewriting", "multiset", "exponential function", "inference", "recursion"], "abstract": "We present a model for recursive Bayesian filtering based on lifted multiset states. Combining multisets with lifting makes it possible to simultaneously exploit multiple strategies for reducing inference complexity when compared to list-based grounded state representations. The core idea is to borrow the concept of Maximally Parallel Multiset Rewriting Systems and to enhance it by concepts from Rao-Blackwellisation and Lifted Inference, giving a representation of state distributions that enables efficient inference. In worlds where the random variables that define the system state are exchangeable - where the identity of entities does not matter - it automatically uses a representation that abstracts from ordering (achieving an exponential reduction in complexity) and it automatically adapts when observations or system dynamics destroy exchangeability by breaking symmetry.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Rostock", "University of Rostock", "University of Rostock", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "University of Rostock"], "authors": ["Stefan L\u00fcdtke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=uuml=dtke:Stefan", "Max Schr\u00f6der.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schr=ouml=der:Max", "Sebastian Bader.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bader_0001:Sebastian", "Kristian Kersting.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kersting:Kristian", "Thomas Kirste.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirste:Thomas"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
