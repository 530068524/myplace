{"title": "Joint Inference for Extracting Text Descriptors from Triage Images of Mass Disaster Victims.", "fields": ["inference", "machine learning", "probabilistic logic", "triage", "graphical model"], "abstract": "The major contributions of this work include a set of biographical feature extractors brought together by a probabilistic graphical model. The graphical model acts as a communication medium between different feature extractors, together resulting in a text descriptor to describe triage images of disaster victims. The model is built using domain information gathered from data and literature.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County"], "authors": ["Niyati Chhaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chhaya:Niyati"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
