{"title": "(Infra)structures of Volunteering.", "fields": ["theory of forms", "knowledge management", "socioeconomics", "social structure", "interdependence"], "abstract": "We report on the results of a diary study of the everyday volunteering and help giving of individuals in the millennial generation. We describe the breadth of work structures implicated in volunteering, the social structures implicated in volunteering, and the interdependencies between the two. We analyze the roles that technology plays in volunteering with a particular focus on the forms of infrastructure that are constituted through the work and social structures of this philanthropic activity. Finally, we reflect on design opportunities for infrastructures where work and social structures meet to support more everyday, ubiquitous forms of volunteering.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Indiana University", "Cornell University", "Indiana University"], "authors": ["Amy Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Amy", "Zheng Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Zheng", "Matthias Korn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korn:Matthias"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
