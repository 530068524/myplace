It can be expressed as a linear program, and, with appropriate preprocessing, interior-point methods can be used to find a solution for moderately large problems. Dealing with very large problems, e.g., involving data up to and beyond the terabyte regime, remains a challenge. Here, we present a randomized algorithm that runs in nearly linear time in the size of the input and that, with constant probability, computes a $(1+\\epsilon)$ approximate solution to an arbitrary quantile regression problem. As a key step, our algorithm computes a low-distortion subspace-preserving embedding with respect to the loss function of quantile regression. Our empirical evaluation illustrates that our algorithm ...", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "LinkedIn", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Jiyan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jiyan", "Xiangrui Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Xiangrui", "Michael W.
