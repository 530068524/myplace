The Cat Cat Revolution (CCR) is a digital game of cat and mouse that allows cats to participate in play through a species-appropriate interface. The game applies Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to pets and casts pets as participants in the gaming experience. During the pilot study, pet owners characterized CCR as a mutually positive experience, describing the game as a fun way to play. CCR explores the effects of including pets in the digital gaming experience.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Consultant, Pit ... nnsylvania, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Frank Noz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noz:Frank", "Jinsoo An.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/An:Jinsoo"], "pages": 4}
