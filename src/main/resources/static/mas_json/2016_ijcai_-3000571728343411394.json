{"title": "Canonical Orderings on Grids.", "fields": ["mathematics", "mathematical optimization", "jump point search", "grid", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Jump Point Search, an algorithm developed for fast search on uniform cost grids, has successfully improved the performance of grid-based search. But, the approach itself is actually a set of diverse ideas applied together. This paper decomposes the algorithm and gradually re-constructs it, showing the component pieces from which the algorithm is constructed. In this process, we are able to define a spectrum of new algorithms that borrow and repurpose ideas from Jump Point Search. This decomposition opens the door for applying the ideas from Jump Point Search in other grid domains with significantly different characteristics from two dimensional grids.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Denver", "DigiPen Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Nathan R.
