We look in particular at email and online social networks. We offer a theoretical framework for understanding the errors in assumptions about the singularity of identity that are currently inscribed into the sharing models of social technology systems. Through a questionnaire study we examine how people facet their identities and their lives, and how these facets are expressed through use of email and Facebook. We found family was an extremely important context for sharing online, and that email was still a preferred form of communication for private sharing across facets of life. Single, working men had the highest level of incompatible facets, and a higher level of facet incompatibility was correlated with increased email usage and worry about sharing in the context of social networks.", "citation": "Citations (143)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Shelly Farnham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farnham:Shelly", "Elizabeth F.
