With this paper, we contribute to the theoretical understanding of this research area. We present the first computational complexity analysis of evolutionary algorithms for a dynamic variant of a classical combinatorial optimization problem, namely makespan scheduling. We study the model of a strong adversary which is allowed to change one job at regular intervals. Furthermore, we investigate the setting of random changes. Our results show that randomized local search and a simple evolutionary algorithm are very effective in dynamically tracking changes made to the problem instance.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "Technical University of Denmark"], "authors": ["Frank Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann_0001:Frank", "Carsten Witt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Witt:Carsten"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
