{"title": "A Mechanization of the Blakers-Massey Connectivity Theorem in Homotopy Type Theory.", "fields": ["suspension", "homotopy hypothesis", "whitehead theorem", "regular homotopy", "cofibration"], "abstract": "This paper contributes to recent investigations of the use of homotopy type theory to give machine-checked proofs of constructions from homotopy theory. We present a mechanized proof of a result called the Blakers-Massey connectivity theorem, which relates the higher-dimensional loop structures of two spaces sharing a common part (represented by a pushout type, which is a generalization of a disjoint sum type) to those of the common part itself. This theorem gives important information about the pushout type, and has a number of useful corollaries, including the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which was used in previous formalizations. The proof is more direct than existing ones that apply in general category-theoretic settings for homotopy theory, and its mechanization is concise and high-level, due to novel combinations of ideas from homotopy theory and from type theory.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "Wesleyan University", "Stockholm University"], "authors": ["Kuen-Bang Hou (Favonia).....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Favonia=:Kuen=Bang_Hou", "Eric Finster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finster:Eric", "Daniel R.
