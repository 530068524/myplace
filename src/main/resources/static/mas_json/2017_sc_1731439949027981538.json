{"title": "Tagit: an integrated indexing and search service for file systems.", "fields": ["torrent file", "data as a service", "data file", "file server", "distributed file system"], "abstract": "Data services such as search, discovery, and management in scalable distributed environments have traditionally been decoupled from the underlying file systems, and are often deployed using external databases and indexing services. However, modern data production rates, looming data movement costs, and the lack of metadata, entail revisiting the decoupled file system-data services design philosophy.   In this paper, we present TagIt, a scalable data management service framework aimed at scientific datasets, which is tightly integrated into a shared-nothing distributed file system. A key feature of TagIt is a scalable, distributed metadata indexing framework, using which we implement a flexible tagging capability to support data discovery. The tags can also be associated with an active operator, for pre-processing, filtering, or automatic metadata extraction, which we seamlessly offload to file servers in a load-aware fashion. Our evaluation shows that TagIt can expedite data search by up to 10X over the extant decoupled approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Sogang University", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Hyogi Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Hyogi", "Youngjae Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Youngjae", "Sudharshan S.
