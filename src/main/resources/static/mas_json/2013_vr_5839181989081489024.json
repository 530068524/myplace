The prototype system allows users to see remote participants and their surroundings merged into the local environment through the use of an optical see-through head-worn display. Real-time 3D acquisition and head tracking allows the remote imagery to be seen from the correct point of view and with proper occlusion. A projector-based lighting control system permits the remote imagery to appear bright and opaque even in a lit room. Immersion can be adjusted across the VR continuum. Our approach relies only on commodity hardware; we also experiment with wider field of view custom displays.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Andrew Maimone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maimone:Andrew", "Xubo Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xubo", "Nate Dierk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dierk:Nate", "Andrei State.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/State:Andrei", "Mingsong Dou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dou:Mingsong", "Henry Fuchs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuchs:Henry"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
