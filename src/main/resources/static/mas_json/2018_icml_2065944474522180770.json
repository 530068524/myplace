We show that GaP can be rewritten free of the score/activation matrix. This gives us new insights about the estimation of the topic/dictionary matrix by maximum marginal likelihood estimation. In particular, this explains the robustness of this estimator to over-specified values of the factorization rank, especially its ability to automatically prune irrelevant dictionary columns, as empirically observed in previous work. The marginalization of the activation matrix leads in turn to a new Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm with favorable properties.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Louis Filstroff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filstroff:Louis", "Alberto Lumbreras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lumbreras:Alberto", "C\u00e9dric F\u00e9votte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/F=eacute=votte:C=eacute=dric"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
