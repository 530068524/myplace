{"title": "Classroom Wikipedia participation effects on future intentions to contribute.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "social media", "coursework", "multimedia", "user generated content"], "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges faced by social media sites like Wikipedia is how to motivate users to contribute content. Research continues to demonstrate that only a small percentage of users contribute to user-generated content sites. In this study we assess the results of a Wikimedia Foundation initiative, which had graduate and undergraduate students from 22 U.S. universities contribute content to Wikipedia articles as part of their coursework. 185 students were asked about their participation in the initiative and their intention to participate on Wikipedia in the future. Results suggest that intentions to continue contributing are influenced by the initial attitude towards the class, and the degree to which students perceived they were writing for a global audience.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University"], "authors": ["Paul Zube.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zube:Paul", "Alcides Velasquez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Velasquez:Alcides", "Elif Ozkaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ozkaya:Elif", "Cliff Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Cliff", "Jonathan Obar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obar:Jonathan"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
