We employ multiple component trackers using texture, color, and illumination invariant features, respectively. Each component tracker traces a target object forwardly and then backwardly over a time interval. By analyzing the pair of the forward and backward trajectories, we measure the robustness of the component tracker. To this end, we extract the geometry similarity, the cyclic weight, and the appearance similarity from the forward and backward trajectories. We select the optimal component tracker to yield the maximum robustness score, and use its forward trajectory as the final tracking result. Experimental results show that the proposed MTA tracker improves the robustness and the accuracy of tracking, outperforming the state-of-the-art trackers on a recent benchmark dataset.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Korea University", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Korea University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dae-Youn Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Dae=Youn", "Jae-Young Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Jae=Young", "Chang-Su Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Chang=Su"], "pages": 9}
