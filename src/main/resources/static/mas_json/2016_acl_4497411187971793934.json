{"title": "Jointly Learning to Embed and Predict with Multiple Languages.", "fields": ["euclidean geometry", "supervised learning", "optimization problem", "embedding", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We propose a joint formulation for learning task-specific cross-lingual word embeddings, along with classifiers for that task. Unlike prior work, which first learns the embeddings from parallel data and then plugs them in a supervised learning problem, our approach is oneshot: a single optimization problem combines a co-regularizer for the multilingual embeddings with a task-specific loss. We present theoretical results showing the limitation of Euclidean co-regularizers to increase the embedding dimension, a limitation which does not exist for other co-regularizers (such as the \u20181distance). Despite its simplicity, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on the RCV1/RCV2 dataset when transferring from English to German, with training times below 1 minute. On the TED Corpus, we obtain the highest reported scores on 10 out of 11 languages.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Daniel C.
