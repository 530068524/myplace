{"title": "A smile can reveal your age: enabling facial dynamics in age estimation.", "fields": ["access control", "multimedia", "biometrics", "ranging", "mean absolute error"], "abstract": "Estimation of a person's age from the facial image has many applications, ranging from biometrics and access control to cosmetics and entertainment. Many image-based methods have been proposed for this problem. In this paper, we propose a method for the use of dynamic features in age estimation, and show that 1) the temporal dynamics of facial features can be used to improve image-based age estimation; 2) considered alone, static image-based features are more accurate than dynamic features. We have collected and annotated an extensive database of face videos from 400 subjects with an age range between 8 and 76, which allows us to extensively analyze the relevant aspects of the problem. The proposed system, which fuses facial appearance and expression dynamics, performs with a mean absolute error of 4.81 (4.87) years. This represents a significant improvement of accuracy in comparison to the sole use of appearance-based features.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University", "University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Hamdi Dibeklioglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dibeklioglu:Hamdi", "Theo Gevers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gevers:Theo", "Albert Ali Salah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salah:Albert_Ali", "Roberto Valenti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valenti:Roberto"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
