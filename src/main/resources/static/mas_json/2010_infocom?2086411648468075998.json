In order to examine the causes of the unpredictable link state, we first configured an empirical testbed, performed a measurement study, and observed that the link reliability actually depends on an intra-frame SINR distribution. We also discovered that a RSSI (or SINR) value is not always a good indicator to estimate the link state. Based on these results, we propose a modeling framework for estimating the link state in the presence of the wireless interference. We vision that the framework can be used for developing link-aware protocols to achieve their optimal performance in a hostile wireless environment.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Korea University", "Korea University"], "authors": ["Shinuk Woo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woo:Shinuk", "Hwangnam Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hwangnam"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
