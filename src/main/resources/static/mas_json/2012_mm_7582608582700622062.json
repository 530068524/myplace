{"title": "GreenTube: power optimization for mobile videostreaming via dynamic cache management.", "fields": ["cache", "android", "upgrade", "power optimization", "upload"], "abstract": "Mobile video streaming has become one of the most popular applications in the trend of smartphone booming and the prevalence of 3G/4G networks, i.e., HSPA, HSPA+, and LTE. However, the prohibitively high power consumption by 3G/4G radios in smartphones reduces battery life significantly and thus severely hurts user experience. To tackle this challenge, we designed  GreenTube , a system that optimizes power consumption for mobile video streaming by judiciously scheduling downloading activities to minimize unnecessary active periods of 3G/4G radio. GreenTube achieves this by dynamically managing the downloading cache based on user viewing history and network condition. We implemented GreenTube on Android-based smartphones. Experimental results show that GreenTube achieves large power reductions of more than 70% (on the 3G/4G radio) and 40% (for the whole system). We believe GreenTube is a desirable upgrade to the Android system, especially in the light of increasing LTE popularity.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "departments": ["George Mason University", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung"], "authors": ["Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xin", "Mian Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Mian", "Zhan Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Zhan", "Felix C.
