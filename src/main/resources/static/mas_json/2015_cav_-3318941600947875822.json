Verifying properties that depend on the environment yields a large class of uninteresting false alarms. Using a verifier on a program thus requires extensive initial investment in modeling the environment of the program. We propose a technique called angelic verification for verification of open programs, where we constrain a verifier to report warnings only when no acceptable environment specification exists to prove the assertion. Our framework is parametric in a vocabulary and a set of angelic assertions that allows a user to configure the tool. We describe a few instantiations of the framework and an evaluation on a set of real-world benchmarks to show that our technique is competitive with industrial-strength tools even without models of the environment.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ankush Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Ankush", "Shuvendu K.
