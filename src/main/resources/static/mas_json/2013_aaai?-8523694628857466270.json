Bidirectional search has long held promise for surpassing A*'s efficiency, and many varieties have been proposed, but it has proven difficult to achieve robust performance across multiple domains in practice. We introduce a simple bidirectional search technique called Incremental KKAdd that judiciously performs backward search to improve the accuracy of the forward heuristic function for any search algorithm. We integrate this technique with A*, assess its theoretical properties, and empirically evaluate its performance across seven benchmark domains. In the best case, it yields a factor of six reduction in node expansions and CPU time compared to A*, and in the worst case, its overhead is provably bounded by a user-supplied parameter, such as 1%. Viewing performance across all domains, it also surpasses previously proposed bidirectional search algorithms. These results indicate that Incremental KKAdd is a robust way to leverage bidirectional search in practice.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of New Hampshire", "University of New Hampshire"], "authors": ["Christopher Makoto Wilt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilt:Christopher_Makoto", "Wheeler Ruml.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruml:Wheeler"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
