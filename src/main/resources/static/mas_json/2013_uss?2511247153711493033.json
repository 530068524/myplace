External hardware-based monitors can serve as a root of trust that is resilient to rootkit attacks. The existing external hardware-based approaches lack an event-triggered verification scheme for mutable kernel objects. To address the issue, we present KI-Mon, a hardware-based platform for event-triggered kernel integrity monitor. A refined form of bus traffic monitoring efficiently verifies the update values of the objects, and callback verification routines can be programmed and executed for a designated event space. We have built a KI-Mon prototype to demonstrate the efficacy of KI-Mon's event-triggered mechanism in terms of performance overhead for the monitored host system and the processor usage of the KI-Mon processor.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["KAIST", "Seoul National University", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Hojoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hojoon", "Hyungon Moon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moon:Hyungon", "DaeHee Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:DaeHee", "Kihwan Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kihwan", "Jihoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jihoon", "Yunheung Paek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paek:Yunheung", "Brent ByungHoon Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Brent_ByungHoon"], "pages": 16}
