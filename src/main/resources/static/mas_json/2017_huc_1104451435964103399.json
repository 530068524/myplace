The study was conducted among members of the Finnish Society for Migraine, and it aimed to determine and recognize the migraine patients with pre-symptoms and whether they would be willing to use wearable sensors in identifying pre-symptoms of migraine. The survey received responses from 565 persons, and more than 90 per cent of the respondents were willing to use the wearable sensors for the measurement of pre-symptoms, as well as to support the treatment. Moreover, the study revealed that 87.8 percent of migraine patients identified migraine early symptoms. The most common symptoms are tiredness, slow thinking, difficulty to find words and visual disturbances. Most of the respondents wanted the device placed on wrist as a watch, wristband or a skin patch.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Hanna-Leena Huttunen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huttunen:Hanna=Leena", "Raija Halonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halonen:Raija", "Heli Koskim\u00e4ki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koskim=auml=ki:Heli"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
