{"title": "Smelling screen: Presenting a virtual odor source on a LCD screen.", "fields": ["sniffing", "odor", "virtual reality", "user interface", "liquid crystal display"], "abstract": "The smelling screen is a new olfactory display that can generate a localized odor distribution on a two-dimensional display screen. The generated odor distribution is as if an odor source had been placed on the screen, and leads the user to perceive the odor as emanating from a specific region of the screen. The position of this virtual odor source can be shifted to an arbitrary position on the screen. The user can freely move his/her head to sniff at various locations on the screen, and can experience realistic changes in the odor intensity with respect to the sniffing location.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology", "Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology", "Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"], "authors": ["Haruka Matsukura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsukura:Haruka", "Tatsuhiro Yoneda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoneda:Tatsuhiro", "Hiroshi Ishida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishida:Hiroshi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
