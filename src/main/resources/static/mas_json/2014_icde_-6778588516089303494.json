{"title": "Top-k preferences in high dimensions.", "fields": ["subspace topology", "workload", "linear combination", "curse of dimensionality", "linear subspace"], "abstract": "Given a set of objects   $\\mathcal {O}$      , each with    $d$      numeric attributes, a  top-  $k$       preference  scores these objects using a linear combination of their attribute values, where the weight on each attribute reflects the interest in this attribute. Given a query preference   $q$      , a  top-   $k$      query  finds the   $k$       objects in    $\\mathcal {O}$       with highest scores with respect to   $q$      . Given a query object   $o$       and a set of preferences   $\\mathcal {Q}$      , a  reverse top-   $k$       query  finds all preferences   $q\\in \\mathcal {Q}$       for which   $o$       becomes one of the top   $k$       objects with respect to   $q$      . Previous solutions to these problems are effective only in low dimensions. In this paper, we develop a solution for much higher dimensions (up to high tens), if many preferences exhibit  sparsity  \u2014i.e., each specifies non-zero weights for only a handful (say   $5$      -   $7$      ) of attributes (though the subsets of such attributes and their weights can vary greatly). Our idea is to select carefully a set of low-dimensional  core subspaces  to \u201ccover\u201d the sparse preferences in a workload. These subspaces allow us to index them more effectively than the full-dimensional space. Being multi-dimensional, each subspace covers many possible preferences; furthermore, multiple subspaces can jointly cover a preference, thereby expanding the coverage beyond each subspace\u2019s dimensionality. Experimental evaluation validates our solution\u2019s effectiveness and advantages over previous solutions.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Albert Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Albert", "Pankaj K.
