{"title": "From interaction to trajectories: designing coherent journeys through user experiences.", "fields": ["interactivity", "user experience design", "craft", "boundary object", "performance studies"], "abstract": "The idea of interactional trajectories through interfaces has emerged as a sensitizing concept from recent studies of tangible interfaces and interaction in museums and galleries. We put this concept to work as a lens to reflect on published studies of complex user experiences that extend over space and time and involve multiple roles and interfaces. We develop a conceptual framework in which trajectories explain these user experiences as journeys through hybrid structures, punctuated by transitions, and in which interactivity and collaboration are orchestrated. Our framework is intended to sensitize future studies, help distill craft knowledge into design guidelines and patterns, identify technology requirements, and provide a boundary object to connect HCI with Performance Studies.", "citation": "Citations (221)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Exeter", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Steve Benford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benford:Steve", "Gabriella Giannachi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giannachi:Gabriella", "Boriana Koleva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koleva:Boriana", "Tom Rodden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodden:Tom"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
