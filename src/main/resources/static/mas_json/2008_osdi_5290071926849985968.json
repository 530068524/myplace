This paper describes a new diagnostic tool, called Chopstix, that continuously collects profiles of low-level OS events (e.g., scheduling, L2 cache misses, CPU utilization, I/O operations, page allocation, locking) at the granularity of executables, procedures and instructions. Chopstix then reconstructs these events offline for analysis. We have used Chopstix to diagnose several elusive problems in a largescale production system, thereby reducing these intermittent problems to reproducible bugs that can be debugged using standard techniques. The key to Chopstix is an approximate data collection strategy that incurs very low overhead. An evaluation shows Chopstix requires under 1% of the CPU, under 256KB of RAM, and under 16MB of disk space per day to collect a rich set of system-wide data.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Google", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Sapan Bhatia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatia:Sapan", "Abhishek Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0003:Abhishek", "Marc E.
