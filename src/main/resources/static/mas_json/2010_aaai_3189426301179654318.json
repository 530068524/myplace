However, the scale of the problem has increased dramatically because of the prevalence of the Web. In this paper, we aim to explore the efficient top-k similar string matching problem. Several efficient strategies are introduced, such as length aware and adaptive q-gram selection. We present a general q-gram based framework and propose two efficient algorithms based on the strategies introduced. Our techniques are experimentally evaluated on three real data sets and show a superior performance.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Zhenglu Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhenglu", "Jianjun Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jianjun", "Masaru Kitsuregawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kitsuregawa:Masaru"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
