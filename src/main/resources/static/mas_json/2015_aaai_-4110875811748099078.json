In this paper we propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach for continuous environments with constraints. The approach combines model-based reinforcement learning with recent advances in approximate optimal control. This results in a bounded-rationality agent that makes decisions in real-time by efficiently solving a sequence of constrained optimization problems on learned sparse Gaussian process models. Such a combination has several advantages. No high-dimensional policy needs to be computed or stored while the learning problem often reduces to a set of lower-dimensional models of the dynamics. In addition, hard constraints can easily be included and objectives can also be changed in real-time to allow for multiple or dynamic tasks. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated on both an extended cart pole domain and a challenging quadcopter navigation task using real data.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Link\u00f6ping University", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Link\u00f6ping University"], "authors": ["Olov Andersson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andersson:Olov", "Fredrik Heintz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heintz:Fredrik", "Patrick Doherty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doherty:Patrick"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
