{"title": "Word-Entity Duet Representations for Document Ranking.", "fields": ["ranking", "machine learning", "graph", "learning to rank"], "abstract": "This paper presents a word-entity duet framework for utilizing knowledge bases in ad-hoc retrieval. In this work, the query and documents are modeled by word-based representations and entity-based representations. Ranking features are generated by the interactions between the two representations, incorporating information from the word space, the entity space, and the cross-space connections through the knowledge graph. To handle the uncertainties from the automatically constructed entity representations, an attention-based ranking model AttR-Duet is developed. With back-propagation from ranking labels, the model learns simultaneously how to demote noisy entities and how to rank documents with the word-entity duet. Evaluation results on TREC Web Track ad-hoc task demonstrate that all of the four-way interactions in the duet are useful, the attention mechanism successfully steers the model away from noisy entities, and together they significantly outperform both word-based and entity-based learning to rank systems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Chenyan Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Chenyan", "Jamie Callan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Callan:Jamie", "Tie-Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tie=Yan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
