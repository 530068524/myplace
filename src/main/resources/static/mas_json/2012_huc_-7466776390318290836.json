{"title": "Multimodal annotation tool for challenging behaviors in people with Autism spectrum disorders.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "android", "multimedia", "annotation", "autism"], "abstract": "Individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) often have challenging behaviors (CB's), such as self-injury or emotional outbursts, which can negatively impact the quality of life of themselves and those around them. Recent advances in mobile and ubiquitous technologies provide an opportunity to efficiently and accurately capture important information preceding and associated with these CB's. The ability to obtain this type of data will help with both intervention and behavioral phenotyping efforts. Through collaboration with behavioral scientists and therapists, we identified relevant design requirements and created an easy-to-use mobile application for collecting, labeling, and sharing in-situ behavior data in individuals diagnosed with ASD. Furthermore, we have released the application to the community as an open-source project so it can be validated and extended by other researchers.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Akane Sano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sano:Akane", "Javier Hernandez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hernandez:Javier", "Jean Deprey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deprey:Jean", "Micah Eckhardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eckhardt:Micah", "Matthew S.
