In this paper, we present a metric, Temporal Variation Metric (TVM), to measure the temporal information of videos. Despite its simplicity, it shows a high correlation coefficient of 0.875 to optical flow which captures all motion information in a video. We use the TVM values to derive a reduced-reference temporal quality assessment metric, Temporal Variation Index (TVI), which quantifies the quality degradation incurred in network transmission. Subjective assessments demonstrate that TVI is a very good predictor of users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Its prediction shows a 92.5% of correlation to subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings. Through video streaming experiments, we show that TVI can also estimate the network conditions such as packet loss and delay. It depicts an accuracy of almost 95% in extensive tests on 183 video traces.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["An (Jack) Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:An_=Jack=", "Amit Pande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pande:Amit", "Eilwoo Baik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baik:Eilwoo", "Prasant Mohapatra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohapatra:Prasant"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
