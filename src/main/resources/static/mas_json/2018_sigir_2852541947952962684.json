{"title": "Pytrec_eval: An Extremely Fast Python Interface to trec_eval.", "fields": ["python", "learning to rank", "ir evaluation", "eval", "query expansion"], "abstract": "We introduce pytrec_eval, a Python interface to the trec_eval information retrieval evaluation toolkit. pytrec_eval exposes the reference implementations of trec_eval within Python as a native extension. We show that pytrec_eval is around one order of magnitude faster than invoking trec_eval as a sub process from within Python. Compared to a native Python implementation of NDCG, pytrec_eval is twice as fast for practically-sized rankings. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness in an application where pytrec_eval is combined with Pyndri and the OpenAI Gym where query expansion is learned using Q-learning.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Christophe Van Gysel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gysel:Christophe_Van", "Maarten de Rijke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rijke:Maarten_de"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
