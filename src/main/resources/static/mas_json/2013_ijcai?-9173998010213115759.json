Despite the large body of work on reputation systems, no metrics exist to directly and quantitatively evaluate and compare them. We present a common conceptual interface for reputation systems and a set of four measurable desiderata that are broadly applicable across multiple domains. These desiderata employ concepts from dynamical systems theory to measure how a reputation system reacts to a strategic agent attempting to maximize its own utility. We study a diverse set of well-known reputation models from the literature in a moral hazard setting and identify a rich variety of characteristics that they support.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "Hazardous Softw ... e, Raleigh, NC"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Christopher J.
