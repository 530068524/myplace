{"title": "Unsupervised Learning by Program Synthesis.", "fields": ["semi supervised learning", "program synthesis", "competitive learning", "wake sleep algorithm", "solver"], "abstract": "We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm that combines probabilistic modeling with solver-based techniques for program synthesis. We apply our techniques to both a visual learning domain and a language learning problem, showing that our algorithm can learn many visual concepts from only a few examples and that it can recover some English inflectional morphology. Taken together, these results give both a new approach to unsupervised learning of symbolic compositional structures, and a technique for applying program synthesis tools to noisy data.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kevin Ellis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ellis:Kevin", "Armando Solar-Lezama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solar=Lezama:Armando", "Joshua B.
