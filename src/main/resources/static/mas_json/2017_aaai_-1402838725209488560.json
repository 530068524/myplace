It has been widely observed that NMT tends to repeatedly translate some source words while mistakenly ignoring other words. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel encoder-decoder-reconstructor framework for NMT. The reconstructor, incorporated into the NMT model, manages to reconstruct the input source sentence from the hidden layer of the output target sentence, to ensure that the information in the source side is transformed to the target side as much as possible. Experiments show that the proposed framework significantly improves the adequacy of NMT output and achieves superior translation result over state-of-the-art NMT and statistical MT systems.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Huawei", "Tsinghua University", "Huawei", "Huawei"], "authors": ["Zhaopeng Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Zhaopeng", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yang", "Lifeng Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Lifeng", "Xiaohua Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaohua", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Hang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
