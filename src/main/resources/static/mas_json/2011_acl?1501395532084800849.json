The method is independent of any particular relation inventory. It relies on describing semantic relations using primitives and manipulating these primitives according to an algebra. The method was tested using a set of eight semantic relations yielding 78 inference axioms which were evaluated over PropBank.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Eduardo Blanco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanco_0002:Eduardo", "Dan I.
