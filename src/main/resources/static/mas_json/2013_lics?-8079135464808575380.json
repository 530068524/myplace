{"title": "On the Context-Freeness Problem for Vector Addition Systems.", "fields": ["bounded function", "corollary", "context free language", "regular language", "decidability"], "abstract": "Petri nets, or equivalently vector addition systems (VAS), are widely recognized as a central model for concurrent systems. Many interesting properties are decidable for this class, such as bounded ness, reach ability, regularity, as well as context-freeness, which is the focus of this paper. The context-freeness problem asks whether the trace language of a given VAS is context-free. This problem was shown to be decidable by Schwer in 1992, but the proof is very complex and intricate. The resulting decision procedure relies on five technical conditions over a customized cover ability graph. These five conditions are shown to be necessary, but the proof that they are sufficient is only sketched. In this paper, we revisit the context-freeness problem for VAS, and give a simpler proof of decidability. Our approach is based on witnesses of non-context-freeness, that are bounded regular languages satisfying a nesting condition. As a corollary, we obtain that the trace language of a VAS is context-free if, and only if, it has a context-free intersection with every bounded regular language.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux", "University of Paris-Est", "University of Bordeaux"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Leroux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leroux:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Vincent Penelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Penelle:Vincent", "Gr\u00e9goire Sutre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sutre:Gr=eacute=goire"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
