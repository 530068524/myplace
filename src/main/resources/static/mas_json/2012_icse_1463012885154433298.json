This research investigates software process improvement (SPI) through the application of knowledge management (KM) at the software project level. A pilot study was conducted to investigate what types of obstacles to knowledge flow exist within a software development project, as well as the potential influence on SPI of their mitigation or removal. The KM technique of \u201cknowledge mapping\u201d was used as a research technique to characterize knowledge flow. Results show that such mitigation or removal was acknowledged by project team members as having the potential for lowering project labor cost, improving schedule adherence, and enhancing final product quality.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County"], "authors": ["Susan M.
