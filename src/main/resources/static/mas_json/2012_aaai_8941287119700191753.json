{"title": "Online Sequence Alignment for Real-Time Audio Transcription by Non-Experts.", "fields": ["transcription", "sequence alignment", "speech recognition"], "abstract": "Real-time transcription provides deaf and hard of hearing people visual access to spoken content, such as classroom instruction, and other live events. Currently, the only reliable source of real-time transcriptions are expensive, highly-trained experts who are able to keep up with speaking rates. Automatic speech recognition is cheaper but produces too many errors in realistic settings. We introduce a new approach in which partial captions from multiple non-experts are combined to produce a high-quality transcription in real-time. We demonstrate the potential of this approach with data collected from 20 non-expert captionists.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Walter S.
