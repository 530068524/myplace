While most work has been focused on developing problem-specific techniques, little is known about how to systematically design the node searching strategy on a branch-and-bound tree. We address the key challenge of learning an adaptive node searching order for any class of problem solvable by branch-and-bound. Our strategies are learned by imitation learning. We apply our algorithm to linear programming based branch-and-bound for solving mixed integer programs (MIP). We compare our method with one of the fastest open-source solvers, SCIP; and a very efficient commercial solver, Gurobi. We demonstrate that our approach achieves better solutions faster on four MIP libraries.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["He He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:He", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal", "Jason Eisner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisner:Jason"], "pages": 9}
