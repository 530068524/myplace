We review prior methods for pruning and then present a new framework that unifies their strengths into a single approach. Using a log linear model, we learn the optimal beam-search pruning parameters for each CYK chart cell, effectively predicting the most promising areas of the model space to explore. We demonstrate that our method is faster than coarse-to-fine pruning, exemplified in both the Charniak and Berkeley parsers, by empirically comparing our parser to the Berkeley parser using the same grammar and under identical operating conditions.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Oregon Health & Science University", "Oregon Health & Science University", "Google", "Oregon Health & Science University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nathan Bodenstab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodenstab:Nathan", "Aaron Dunlop.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunlop:Aaron", "Keith B.
