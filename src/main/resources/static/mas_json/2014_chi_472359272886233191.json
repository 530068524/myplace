Surveying is one approach to their preservation, and can be supported by technology. This paper presents the deployment of a smartphone-based citizen science biodiversity application. Our findings from interviews with members of the biodiversity community revealed a tension between the technology and their established working practices. From our experience, we present a series of general guidelines for those designing citizen science apps.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "Coed Phoenix Na ...
