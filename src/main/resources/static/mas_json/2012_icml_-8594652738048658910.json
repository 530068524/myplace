In this paper, we tackle this challenge by modeling the unknown function as a sample from a high-dimensional Gaussian process (GP) distribution. Assuming that the unknown function only depends on few relevant variables, we show that it is possible to perform joint variable selection and GP optimization. We provide strong performance guarantees for our algorithm, bounding the sample complexity of variable selection, and as well as providing cumulative regret bounds. We further provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of our algorithm on several benchmark optimization problems.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "ETH Zurich", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "authors": ["Bo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bo", "Rui M.
