{"title": "Online Authenticated-Encryption and its Nonce-Reuse Misuse-Resistance.", "fields": ["plaintext", "authenticated encryption", "ciphertext expansion", "symmetric key algorithm", "cryptographic nonce"], "abstract": "A definition of online authenticated-encryption (OAE), call it OAE1, was given by Fleischmann, Forler, and Lucks (2012). It has become a popular definitional target because, despite allowing encryption to be online, security is supposed to be maintained even if nonces get reused. We argue that this expectation is effectively wrong. OAE1 security has also been claimed to capture best-possible security for any online-AE scheme. We claim that this understanding is wrong, too. So motivated, we redefine OAE-security, providing a radically different formulation, OAE2. The new notion effectively does capture best-possible security for a user\u2019s choice of plaintext segmentation and ciphertext expansion. It is achievable by simple techniques from standard tools. Yet even for OAE2, nonce-reuse can still be devastating. The picture to emerge is that no OAE definition can meaningfully tolerate nonce-reuse, but, at the same time, OAE security ought never have been understood to turn on this question.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Georgetown University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Viet Tung Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Viet_Tung", "Reza Reyhanitabar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reyhanitabar:Reza", "Phillip Rogaway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogaway:Phillip", "Damian Viz\u00e1r.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viz=aacute=r:Damian"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 25}
