{"title": "Classifying children with 3D depth cameras for enabling children's safety applications.", "fields": ["computer vision", "false positive rate", "ranging", "artificial intelligence", "computer science"], "abstract": "In this work, we present  ChildSafe , a classification system which exploits human skeletal features collected using a 3D depth camera to classify visual characteristics between children and adults. ChildSafe analyzes the histograms of training samples and implements a bin-boundary-based classifier. We train and evaluate ChildSafe using a large dataset of visual samples collected from 150 elementary school children and 43 adults, ranging in the ages of 7 and 50. Our results suggest that ChildSafe successfully detects children with a proper classification rate of up to 97%, a false negative rate of as low as 1.82%, and a low false positive rate of 1.46%. We envision this work as an effective sub-system for designing various child protection applications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology", "Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology", "Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology", "Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology", "Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Can Basaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basaran:Can", "Hee-Jung Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Hee=Jung", "Ho-Kyeong Ra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ra:Ho=Kyeong", "Sang Hyuk Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Sang_Hyuk", "Taejoon Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Taejoon", "JeongGil Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko:JeongGil"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 5}
