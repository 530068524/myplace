The generalization, which makes use of basic tools from probability theory, is motivated by several examples and delivers a class of abstract argument games whose adequacy is proven robust against uncertainty.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Liverpool", "University of Liverpool"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Davide Grossi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossi:Davide", "Wiebe van der Hoek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoek:Wiebe_van_der"], "pages": 7}
