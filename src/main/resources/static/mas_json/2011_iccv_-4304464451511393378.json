We formulate the multi-observation visual recognition task as a joint sparse representation model and take advantage of the correlations among the multiple observations for classification using a novel joint dynamic sparsity prior. The proposed joint dynamic sparsity prior promotes shared joint sparsity pattern among the multiple sparse representation vectors at class-level, while allowing distinct sparsity patterns at atom-level within each class in order to facilitate a flexible representation. The proposed method can handle both homogenous as well as heterogenous data within the same framework. Extensive experiments on various visual classification tasks including face recognition and generic object classification demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Northwestern Polytechnical University", "United States Army Research Laboratory", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Haichao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haichao", "Nasser M.
