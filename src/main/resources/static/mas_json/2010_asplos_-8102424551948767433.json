Like current stress-testing methods, it repeatedly runs a given test program with supplied inputs. However, it improves on stress-testing by finding buggy schedules more effectively and by quantifying the probability of missing concurrency bugs. Key to its design is the characterization of the depth of a concurrency bug as the minimum number of scheduling constraints required to find it. In a single run of a program with  n  threads and  k  steps, our scheduler detects a concurrency bug of depth  d  with probability at least 1/ nk  d-1 . We hypothesize that in practice, many concurrency bugs (including well-known types such as ordering errors, atomicity violations, and deadlocks) have small bug-depths, and we confirm the efficiency of our schedule randomization by detecting previously unknown and known concurrency bugs in several production-scale concurrent programs.", "citation": "Citations (208)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Microsoft", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Sebastian Burckhardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burckhardt:Sebastian", "Pravesh Kothari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kothari:Pravesh", "Madanlal Musuvathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Musuvathi:Madanlal", "Santosh Nagarakatte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagarakatte:Santosh"], "pages": 12}
