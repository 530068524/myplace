We then extend our algorithm to work with arbitrary Boolean combinations of LMEs and LMDs using two approaches - one based on decision diagrams and the other based on SMT solving. Our experiments establish conclusively that our technique significantly outperforms alternative techniques for eliminating quantifiers from systems of LMEs and LMDs in practice.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Homi Bhabha National Institute", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ajith K.
