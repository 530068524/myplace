{"title": "Room2Room: Enabling Life-Size Telepresence in a Projected Augmented Reality Environment.", "fields": ["implementation", "gaze", "projection mapping", "illusion", "conversation"], "abstract": "Room2Room is a telepresence system that leverages projected augmented reality to enable life-size, co-present interaction between two remote participants. Our solution recreates the experience of a face-to-face conversation by performing 3D capture of the local user with color + depth cameras and projecting their life-size virtual copy into the remote space. This creates an illusion of the remote per-son\u00e2  s physical presence in the local space, as well as a shared understanding of verbal and non-verbal cues (e.g., gaze, pointing.) In addition to the technical details of two prototype implementations, we contribute strategies for projecting remote participants onto physically plausible locations, such that they form a natural and consistent conversational formation with the local participant. We also present observations and feedback from an evaluation with 7 pairs of participants on the usability of our solution for solving a collaborative, physical task.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Southern California", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Tomislav Pejsa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pejsa:Tomislav", "Julian Kantor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kantor:Julian", "Hrvoje Benko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benko:Hrvoje", "Eyal Ofek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ofek:Eyal", "Andrew D.
