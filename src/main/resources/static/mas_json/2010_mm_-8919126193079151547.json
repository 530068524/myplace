In this paper, we propose a multi-correlation probabilistic matrix factorization (MPMF) algorithm for the correlation estimation. Different from the traditional solutions which treat the image-word correlation, image similarity and word relation independently or sequentially, in the proposed MPMF, these three elements are integrated together simultaneously and seamlessly. Specifically, we have derived two low-dimensional sets by conducting a joint factorization upon the word-to-image relation matrix, the image similarity matrix, and the word relation matrix to derive two low-dimensional sets of latent word factors and latent image factors. Finally, the annotation words of each untagged or noisily tagged image can be predicted by reconstructing the image-word correlations with the both derived latent factors. Experimental results on the Corel dataset and a Flickr image dataset show the superior performance of our proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-arts.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Zechao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zechao", "Jing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Jing", "Xiaobin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaobin", "Tinglin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tinglin", "Hanqing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hanqing"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
