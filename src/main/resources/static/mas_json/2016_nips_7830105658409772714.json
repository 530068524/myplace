{"title": "Finding significant combinations of features in the presence of categorical covariates.", "fields": ["categorical variable", "confounding", "covariate", "discriminative model", "conditioning"], "abstract": "In high-dimensional settings, where the number of features p is typically much larger than the number of samples n, methods which can systematically examine arbitrary combinations of features, a huge 2^p-dimensional space, have recently begun to be explored. However, none of the current methods is able to assess the association between feature combinations and a target variable while conditioning on a categorical covariate, in order to correct for potential confounding effects. We propose the Fast Automatic Conditional Search (FACS) algorithm, a significant discriminative itemset mining method which conditions on categorical covariates and only scales as O(k log k), where k is the number of states of the categorical covariate. Based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test, FACS demonstrates superior speed and statistical power on simulated and real-world datasets compared to the state of the art, opening the door to numerous applications in biomedicine.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Max Planck Society", "University of T\u00fcbingen"], "authors": ["Laetitia Papaxanthos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papaxanthos:Laetitia", "Felipe Llinares-L\u00f3pez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Llinares=L=oacute=pez:Felipe", "Dean A.
