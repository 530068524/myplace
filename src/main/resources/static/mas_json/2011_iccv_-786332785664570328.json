{"title": "The NBNN kernel.", "fields": ["naive bayes classifier", "contextual image classification", "discriminative model", "kernel", "vector quantization"], "abstract": "Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) has recently been proposed as a powerful, non-parametric approach for object classification, that manages to achieve remarkably good results thanks to the avoidance of a vector quantization step and the use of image-to-class comparisons, yielding good generalization. In this paper, we introduce a kernelized version of NBNN. This way, we can learn the classifier in a discriminative setting. Moreover, it then becomes straightforward to combine it with other kernels. In particular, we show that our NBNN kernel is complementary to standard bag-of-features based kernels, focussing on local generalization as opposed to global image composition. By combining them, we achieve state-of-the-art results on Caltech101 and 15 Scenes datasets. As a side contribution, we also investigate how to speed up the NBNN computations.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "MPI Informatics ... r\u00fccken, Germany"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Tinne Tuytelaars.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuytelaars:Tinne", "Mario Fritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fritz:Mario", "Kate Saenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saenko:Kate", "Trevor Darrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darrell:Trevor"], "pages": 8}
