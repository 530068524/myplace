The reenactment of internal model pairs can be considered a form of motor simulation, which supports both perceptual prediction and action understanding at the goal level. However, this procedure is generally considered to be computationally inefficient. We present a model that dynamically reallocates computational resources to more accurate internal models depending on both the available prior information and the prediction error of the inverse-forward models, and which leads to successful action recognition. We present experimental results that test the robustness and efficiency of our model in real-world scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Palermo", "University of Palermo", "Consiglio Nazio ...
