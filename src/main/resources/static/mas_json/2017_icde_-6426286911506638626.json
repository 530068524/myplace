{"title": "Secure Skyline Queries on Cloud Platform.", "fields": ["query optimization", "server", "information privacy", "scalability", "encryption"], "abstract": "Outsourcing data and computation to cloud server provides a cost-e ective way to support large scale data storage and query processing. However, due to security and privacy concerns, sensitive data (e.g., medical records) need to be protected from the cloud server and other unauthorized users. One approach is to outsource encrypted data to the cloud server and have the cloud server perform query processing on the encrypted data only. It remains a challenging task to support various queries over encrypted data in a secure and e cient way such that the cloud server does not gain any knowledge about the data, query, and query result. In this paper, we study the problem of secure skyline queries over encrypted data. The skyline query is particularly important for multicriteria decision making but also presents significant challenges due to its complex computations. We propose a fully secure skyline query protocol on data encrypted using semanticallysecure encryption. As a key subroutine, we present a new secure dominance protocol, which can be also used as a building block for other queries. Finally, we provide both serial and parallelized implementations and empirically study the protocols in terms of e ciency and scalability under di erent parameter settings, verifying the feasibility of our proposed solutions.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Emory University", "Emory University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Jinfei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jinfei", "Juncheng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Juncheng", "Li Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong_0001:Li", "Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
