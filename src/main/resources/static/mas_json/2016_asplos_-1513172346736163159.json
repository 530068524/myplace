Recent research has expanded the dimensions of heterogeneity to include diverse Instruction Set Architectures, called Heterogeneous-ISA Chip Multiprocessors. This work leverages such an architecture to realize substantial new security benefits, and in particular, to thwart Return-Oriented Programming. This paper proposes a novel security defense called HIPStR -- Heterogeneous-ISA Program State Relocation -- that performs dynamic randomization of run-time program state, both within and across ISAs. This technique outperforms the state-of-the-art just-in-time code reuse (JIT-ROP) defense by an average of 15.6%, while simultaneously providing greater security guarantees against classic return-into-libc, ROP, JOP, brute force, JIT-ROP, and several evasive variants.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Ashish Venkat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkat:Ashish", "Sriskanda Shamasunder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamasunder:Sriskanda", "Hovav Shacham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shacham:Hovav", "Dean M.
