However, it has been insufficient in modeling small-target acquisition with finger-touch based input on screens. We propose a  dual-distribution hypothesis  to interpret the distribution of the endpoints in finger touch input. We hypothesize the movement endpoint distribution as a sum of two independent normal distributions. One distribution reflects the relative precision governed by the speed-accuracy tradeoff rule in the human motor system, and the other captures the absolute precision of finger touch independent of the speed-accuracy tradeoff effect. Based on this hypothesis, we derived the  FFitts  model - an expansion of Fitts' law for finger touch input. We present three experiments in 1D target acquisition, 2D target acquisition and touchscreen keyboard typing tasks respectively. The results showed that FFitts law is more accurate than Fitts' law in modeling finger input on touchscreens. At 0.91 or a greater  R  2  value, FFitts' index of difficulty is able to account for significantly more variance than conventional Fitts' index of difficulty based on either a nominal target width or an effective target width in all the three experiments.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Xiaojun Bi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bi:Xiaojun", "Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang", "Shumin Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Shumin"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
