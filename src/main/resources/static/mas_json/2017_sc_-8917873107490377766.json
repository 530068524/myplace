Researchers and system practitioners rely on field-data studies to understand reliability characteristics and plan for future HPC systems. In this work, we compare and contrast the reliability characteristics of multiple large-scale HPC production systems. Our study covers more than one billion compute node hours across five different systems over a period of 8 years. We confirm previous findings which continue to be valid, discover new findings, and discuss their implications.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Intel", "Northeastern University", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Saurabh Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Saurabh", "Tirthak Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Tirthak", "Christian Engelmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Engelmann:Christian", "Devesh Tiwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwari:Devesh"], "pages": 12}
