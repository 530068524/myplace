To investigate this potential in the context of second language learning, we have developed SpatialEase: a Kinect game for the body-based learning of language that is grounded in space and motion. In this game, learners respond to audio commands in the second language by moving their bodies in space, while a game mechanic based on distributed cued-recall supports learning over time. Our comparison of SpatialEase with the popular Rosetta Stone software for learner of Mandarin Chinese showed similar learning gains over a single session and generated several key implications for the future design of mixed-modality learning systems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "National Taiwan University", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Darren Edge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edge:Darren", "Kai-Yin Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Kai=Yin", "Michael Whitney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whitney:Michael"], "pages": 4}
