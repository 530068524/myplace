{"title": "An Antichain Algorithm for LTL Realizability.", "fields": ["bounded function", "antichain", "realizability", "tree automaton", "nice"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the structure of underlying automata based constructions for solving the LTL realizability and synthesis problem. We show how to reduce the LTL realizability problem to a game with an observer that checks that the game visits a bounded number of times accepting states of a universal co-Buchi word automaton. We show that such an observer can be made deterministic and that this deterministic observer has a nice structure which can be exploited by an incremental algorithm that manipulates antichains of game positions. We have implemented this new algorithm and our first results are very encouraging.", "citation": "Citations (121)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Emmanuel Filiot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filiot:Emmanuel", "Naiyong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Naiyong", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raskin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raskin:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 15}
