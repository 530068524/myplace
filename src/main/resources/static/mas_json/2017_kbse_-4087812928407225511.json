{"title": "DSIbin: identifying dynamic data structures in C/C++ binaries.", "fields": ["program comprehension", "skip list", "linux kernel", "heap", "dynamic data"], "abstract": "Reverse engineering binary code is notoriously difficult and, especially, understanding a binary's dynamic data structures. Existing data structure analyzers are limited wrt. program comprehension: they do not detect complex structures such as skip lists, or lists running through nodes of different types such as in the Linux kernel's cyclic doubly-linked list. They also do not reveal complex parent-child relationships between structures. The tool DSI remedies these shortcomings but requires source code, where type information on heap nodes is available. We present DSIbin, a combination of DSI and the type excavator Howard for the inspection of C/C++ binaries. While a naive combination already improves upon related work, its precision is limited because Howard's inferred types are often too coarse. To address this we auto-generate candidates of refined types based on speculative nested-struct detection and type merging; the plausibility of these hypotheses is then validated by DSI. We demonstrate via benchmarking that DSIbin detects data structures with high precision.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Bamberg", "Microsoft", "University of Bamberg", "University of Bamberg", "University of Bamberg"], "authors": ["Thomas Rupprecht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rupprecht:Thomas", "Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xi", "David H.
