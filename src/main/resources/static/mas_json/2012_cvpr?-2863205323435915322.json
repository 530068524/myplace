While this has been typically addressed separately in the past, we tackle the problem as a single global optimization. We formulate this assignment problem as a min-cost problem by defining a graph structure that captures both temporal correlations between objects as well as spatial correlations enforced by the configuration of the cameras. This leads to a complex combinatorial optimization problem that we solve using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and branching. Our formulation allows us to solve the problem of reconstruction and tracking in a single step by taking all available evidence into account. In several experiments on multiple people tracking and 3D human pose tracking, we show our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Institute for I ... nnover, Germany", "Institute for I ... nnover, Germany", "Institute for I ... nnover, Germany"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Laura Leal-Taix\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leal=Taix=eacute=:Laura", "Gerard Pons-Moll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pons=Moll:Gerard", "Bodo Rosenhahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenhahn:Bodo"], "pages": 8}
