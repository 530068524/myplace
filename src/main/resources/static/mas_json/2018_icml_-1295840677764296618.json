Unlike the popular Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) paradigm, in which the policy is represented by a neural network, the aim in Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning is to find a policy that can be represented in a high-level programming language. Such programmatic policies have the benefits of being more easily interpreted than neural networks, and being amenable to verification by symbolic methods. We propose a new method, called Neurally Directed Program Search (NDPS), for solving the challenging nonsmooth optimization problem of finding a programmatic policy with maxima reward. NDPS works by first learning a neural policy network using DRL, and then performing a local search over programmatic policies that seeks to minimize a distance from this neural \"oracle\". We evaluate NDPS on the task of learning to drive a simulated car in the TORCS car-racing environment. We demonstrate that NDPS is able to discover human-readable policies that pass some significant performance bars. We also find that a well-designed policy language can serve as a regularizer, and result in the discovery of policies that lead to smoother trajectories and are more easily transferred to environments not encountered during training.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Google", "Rice University", "DeepMind"], "authors": ["Abhinav Verma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verma:Abhinav", "Vijayaraghavan Murali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murali:Vijayaraghavan", "Rishabh Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Rishabh", "Pushmeet Kohli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohli:Pushmeet", "Swarat Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Swarat"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
