{"title": "Improving the Linear Programming Technique in the Search for Lower Bounds in Secret Sharing.", "fields": ["information ratio", "secret sharing", "graph", "linear programming", "matroid", "computer science", "port", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We present a new improvement in the linear programming technique to derive lower bounds on the information ratio of secret sharing schemes. We obtain non-Shannon-type bounds without using information inequalities explicitly. Our new technique makes it possible to determine the optimal information ratio of linear secret sharing schemes for all access structures on 5 participants and all graph-based access structures on 6 participants. In addition, new lower bounds are presented also for some small matroid ports and, in particular, the optimal information ratios of the linear secret sharing schemes for the ports of the Vamos matroid are determined.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Paris", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Universitat Rovira i Virgili"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Oriol Farr\u00e0s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farr=agrave=s:Oriol", "Tarik Kaced.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaced:Tarik", "Sebasti\u00e0 Mart\u00edn Mollev\u00ed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mollev=iacute=:Sebasti=agrave=_Mart=iacute=n", "Carles Padr\u00f3.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padr=oacute=:Carles"], "pages": 25}
