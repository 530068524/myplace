{"title": "Empirical Bernstein Inequalities for U-Statistics.", "fields": ["bernstein inequalities", "special case", "test set", "conditional variance", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We present original empirical Bernstein inequalities for U-statistics with bounded symmetric kernels q. They are expressed with respect to empirical estimates of either the variance of q or the conditional variance that appears in the Bernstein-type inequality for U-statistics derived by Arcones [2]. Our result subsumes other existing empirical Bernstein inequalities, as it reduces to them when U-statistics of order 1 are considered. In addition, it is based on a rather direct argument using two applications of the same (non-empirical) Bernstein inequality for U-statistics. We discuss potential applications of our new inequalities, especially in the realm of learning ranking/scoring functions. In the process, we exhibit an efficient procedure to compute the variance estimates for the special case of bipartite ranking that rests on a sorting argument. We also argue that our results may provide test set bounds and particularly interesting empirical racing algorithms for the problem of online learning of scoring functions.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Aix-Marseille University", "Aix-Marseille University", "Aix-Marseille University"], "authors": ["Thomas Peel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peel:Thomas", "Sandrine Anthoine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anthoine:Sandrine", "Liva Ralaivola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ralaivola:Liva"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
