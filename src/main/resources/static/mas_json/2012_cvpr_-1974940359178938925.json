To minimize the number of user interactions (\u201cseeds\u201d) required until the result is correct, we want the computer to actively query the human for input at the most critical locations, in analogy to active learning. These locations are found by means of suitable uncertainty measures. We propose various such measures for watershed cuts along with a theoretical analysis of some of their properties. Extensive evaluation on two types of 3D electron microscopic volumes of neural tissue shows that measures which estimate the non-local consequences of new user inputs achieve performance close to an oracle endowed with complete knowledge of the ground truth.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "National Institutes of Health", "MPI for Medical ... 9120 Heidelberg"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Christoph N.
