{"title": "Real-Time Assistance in Multimedia Capture Using Social Media.", "fields": ["social media", "photography", "videography", "amateur", "composition"], "abstract": "In the last decade, we have seen significant improvement in the ease and cost of capturing multimedia content. However, the aesthetic quality of the content captured by an amateur user still needs substantial improvement. This doctoral research aims at providing real-time assistance to amateur users so that they can capture high quality photographs and home videos. Our approach is focused on learning the art of photography and videography from multimedia content shared on social media. We have proposed a context-based photography learning method which can assist a user in capturing high quality photographs. The photography learning is augmented with contextual information such as time, geo-location, environmental conditions and type of image, which have an impact on photography. The proposed method can provide real-time feedback to the user regarding scene composition, camera parameters, camera movement and viewpoint. We have presented some preliminary results and also described the planned future work.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yogesh Singh Rawat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rawat:Yogesh_Singh"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
