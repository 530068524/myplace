{"title": "Real-Time Control of I/O COTS Peripherals for Embedded Systems.", "fields": ["conventional pci", "real time control system", "controller", "server", "pci express"], "abstract": "Real-time embedded systems are increasingly being built using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components such as mass-produced peripherals and buses to reduce costs, time-to-market, and increase performance. Unfortunately, COTS interconnect systems do not usually guarantee timeliness, and might experience severe timing degradation in the presence of high-bandwidth I/O peripherals. To address this problem, we designed a real-time I/O management system comprised of 1) real-time bridges, and 2) a reservation controller. The proposed framework is used to transparently put the I/O subsystem of a COTS-based embedded system under the discipline of real-time scheduling. We also discuss computing a delay bound for I/O data transactions and determining worst-case buffer size. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that our prototype real-time I/O management system successfully prioritizes I/O traffic and guarantees its timeliness.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Stanley Bak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bak:Stanley", "Emiliano Betti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Betti:Emiliano", "Rodolfo Pellizzoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pellizzoni:Rodolfo", "Marco Caccamo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caccamo:Marco", "Lui Sha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sha:Lui"], "pages": 11}
