A hurdle to their widespread adoption is the lack of garbage collection algorithms that offer predictable space-and-time performance in the face of fragmentation. We introduce SCHISM/CMR, a new concurrent and real-time garbage collector that is fragmentation tolerant and guarantees time-and-space worst-case bounds while providing good throughput. SCHISM/CMR combines mark-region collection of fragmented objects and arrays (arraylets) with separate replication-copying collection of immutable arraylet spines, so as to cope with external fragmentation when running in small heaps. We present an implementation of SCHISM/CMR in the Fiji VM, a high-performance Java virtual machine for mission-critical systems, along with a thorough experimental evaluation on a wide variety of architectures, including server-class and embedded systems. The results show that SCHISM/CMR tolerates fragmentation better than previous schemes, with a much more acceptable throughput penalty.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Fiji Systems, I ... apolis, IN, USA", "Fiji Systems, I ... apolis, IN, USA", "Fiji Systems, I ... apolis, IN, USA"], "authors": ["Filip Pizlo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pizlo:Filip", "Lukasz Ziarek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Ziarek:Lukasz", "Petr Maj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maj:Petr", "Antony L.
