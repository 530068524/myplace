{"title": "RF-pick: comparing order picking using a HUD with wearable RFID verification to traditional pick methods.", "fields": ["order picking", "bin", "barcode", "head up display", "order fulfillment"], "abstract": "Order picking accounts for 55% of the annual $60 billion spent on warehouse operations in the United States. Reducing human-induced errors in the order fulfillment process can save warehouses and distributors significant costs. We investigate a radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based verification method wherein wearable RFID scanners, worn on the wrists, scan passive RFID tags mounted on an item's bin as the item is picked; this method is used in conjunction with a head-up display (HUD) to guide the user to the correct item. We compare this RFID verification method to pick-to-light with button verification, pick-to-paper with barcode verification, and pick-to-paper with no verification. We find that pick-to-HUD with RFID verification enables significantly faster picking, provides the lowest error rate, and provides the lowest task workload.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "United States Military Academy", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Charu Thomas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomas:Charu", "Theodore Panagiotopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panagiotopoulos:Theodore", "Pramod Kotipalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotipalli:Pramod", "Malcolm Haynes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haynes:Malcolm", "Thad Starner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starner:Thad"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
