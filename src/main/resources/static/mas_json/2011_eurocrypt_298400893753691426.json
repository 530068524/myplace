We identify, motivate, and study pseudo-freeness in face of adaptive adversaries who may learn solutions to other non-trivial equations before having to solve a new non-trivial equation.\n\nWe present a novel, carefully crafted definition of adaptive pseudofreeness that walks a fine line between being too weak and being unsatisfiable. We show that groups that satisfy our definition yield, via a generic construction, digital and network coding signature schemes.\n\nFinally, we obtain concrete constructions of such schemes in the RSA group by showing this group to be adaptive pseudo-free. In particular, we demonstrate the generality of our framework for signatures by showing that most existing schemes are instantiations of our generic construction.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Catania", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Dario Catalano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catalano:Dario", "Dario Fiore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiore:Dario", "Bogdan Warinschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Warinschi:Bogdan"], "pages": 17}
