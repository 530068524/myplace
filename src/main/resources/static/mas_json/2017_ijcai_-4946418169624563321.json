{"title": "Predicting the Quality of Short Narratives from Social Media.", "fields": ["social media", "computational model", "narrative", "classifier", "active learning"], "abstract": "An important and difficult challenge in building computational models for narratives is the automatic evaluation of narrative quality. Quality evaluation connects narrative understanding and generation as generation systems need to evaluate their own products. To circumvent difficulties in acquiring annotations, we employ upvotes in social media as an approximate measure for story quality. We collected 54,484 answers from a crowd-powered question-and-answer website, Quora, and then used active learning to build a classifier that labeled 28,320 answers as stories. To predict the number of upvotes without the use of social network features, we create neural networks that model textual regions and the interdependence among regions, which serve as strong benchmarks for future research. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale study for automatic evaluation of narrative quality.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Boston", "University of Massachusetts Boston", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Tong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0007:Tong", "Ping Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Ping", "Boyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Boyang"], "pages": 7}
