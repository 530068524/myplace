However, finding optimal patterns that achieve multiple-coverage in a plane remains a long-lasting open problem. In this paper, we first derive the optimal deployment density bound for two-coverage deployment patterns where Voronoi polygons generated by sensor nodes are congruent.We then propose optimal two-coverage patterns based on the optimal bound. We further extend these patterns by considering the connectivity requirement and design a set of optimal patterns that achieve two-coverage and one-, two-, and three-connectivity. We also study optimal patterns under practical considerations. To our knowledge, our work is the very first that proves the optimality of multiple-coverage deployment patterns.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Dartmouth", "Soochow University", "Ohio State University", "University of Macau", "University of Macau"], "authors": ["Xiaole Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Xiaole", "Ziqiu Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Ziqiu", "Dong Xuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xuan:Dong", "Biao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Biao", "Wei Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Wei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
