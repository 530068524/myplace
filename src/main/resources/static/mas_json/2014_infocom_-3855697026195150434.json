We present a traffic watermarking approach with arbitrarily low false positives and easy applicability. We provide statistical tests for detecting watermarked flows, and we compute the false positive and false negative rates of these tests both analytically and experimentally. Furthermore, we implemented the proposed watermarking system (Rippler) in a small university lab network. We ran our system for four months and detected 38 dependencies among 54 services. Finally, we compared the efficiency of our approach against three previous systems by testing them on this real-world network data.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Ali Zand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zand:Ali", "Giovanni Vigna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vigna:Giovanni", "Richard A.
