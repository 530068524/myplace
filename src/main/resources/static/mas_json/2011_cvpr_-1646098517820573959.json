This task is typically performed in a purely unsupervised setting, and as a result, performance depends critically upon accurate assessments of similarity between unlabeled image regions. To improve the accuracy of category discovery, we develop a novel multiple kernel learning algorithm based on structural SVM, which optimizes a similarity space for nearest-neighbor prediction. The optimized space is then used to cluster unlabeled data and identify new categories. Experimental results on the MSRC and PASCAL VOC2007 data sets indicate that using an optimized similarity metric can improve clustering for category discovery. Furthermore, we demonstrate that including both labeled and unlabeled training data when optimizing the similarity metric can improve the overall quality of the system.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Computer Scienc ... ring Department", "Computer Scienc ... ring Department", "Computer Scienc ... ring Department"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Carolina Galleguillos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galleguillos:Carolina", "Brian McFee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McFee:Brian", "Serge J.
