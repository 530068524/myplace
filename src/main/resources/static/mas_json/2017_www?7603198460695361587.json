In this paper, we propose J-FORCE, a crash-free forced JavaScript execution engine to systematically explore possible execution paths and reveal malicious behaviors in such malware. In particular, J-FORCE records branch outcomes and mutates them for further explorations. J-FORCE inspects function parameter values that may reveal malicious intentions and expose suspicious DOM injections. We addressed a number of technical challenges encountered. For instance, we keep track of missing objects and DOM elements, and create them on demand. To verify the efficacy of our techniques, we apply J-FORCE to detect Exploit Kit (EK) attacks and malicious Chrome extensions. We observe that J-FORCE is more effective compared to the existing tools.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Kyungtae Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kyungtae", "I Luk Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:I_Luk", "Chung Hwan Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Chung_Hwan", "Yonghwi Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Yonghwi", "Yunhui Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yunhui", "Xiangyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Xiangyu", "Dongyan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Dongyan"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
