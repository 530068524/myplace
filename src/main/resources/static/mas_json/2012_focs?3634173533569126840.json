Networks 8(1):17\u201336] and by Shigeno [Shigeno M (2006) Maximum network flows with concave gains. Math. Programming 107(3):439\u2013459]. We give a polynomial time combinatorial algorithm for solving corresponding flow maximization problems, finding an e-approximate solution in O(m(m\u03c3+log n)log(MUm/e)) arithmetic operations, where M and U are upper bounds on simple parameters, and \u03c3 is the complexity of a value oracle query for the gain functions. This also gives a new algorithm for linear generalized flows, an efficient, purely scaling variant of the Fat-Path algorithm by Goldberg et al. [Goldberg AV, Plotkin SA, Tardos E (1991) Combinatorial algorithms for the generalized circulation problem. Math. Oper. Res. 16(2):351\u2013381], not using any cycle cancellations.
