In the basic version of this problem (basic-ICF), we are given an undirected n-vertex graph $G$ with edge capacities c(e), a subset T of vertices called terminals, and a demand D(t,t') for every pair (t,t') of the terminals. The goal is to find a maximum value \u03bb, and a collection  P  of paths, such that every pair (t,t') of terminals is connected by \u230a \u03bb \u22c5 D(t,t')\u230b paths in P, and the number of paths containing any edge e is at most c(e). We show an algorithm that achieves a poly log n-approximation for basic-ICF, while violating the edge capacities by only a constant factor. We complement this result by proving that no efficient algorithm can achieve a factor \u03b1-approximation with congestion c for any values \u03b1,c satisfying \u03b1 \u22c5 c=O(log log n/log log log n), unless NP \u2286 ZPTIME(n poly log n ). We then turn to study the more general group version of the problem (group=ICF), in which we are given a collection (S 1 ,T 1 ),...,(S k ,T k )} of pairs of vertex subsets, and for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, a demand D i  is specified. The goal is to find a maximum value \u03bb and a collection P of paths, such that for each i, at least \u230a \u03bb \u22c5 D i \u230b paths connect the vertices of S i  to the vertices of T i , while respecting the edge capacities. We show that for any 1 \u2264 c \u2264 O(log log n), no efficient algorithm can achieve a factor O(n 1/(2 2c+3 ) )-approximation with congestion c for the problem, unless NP \u2286 DTIME(n O(log log n) ). On the other hand, we show an efficient randomized algorithm that finds a poly log n-approximate solution with a constant congestion, if we are guaranteed that the optimal solution contains at least D \u2265 k poly log n paths connecting every pair (S i ,T i ).", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Princeton University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Parinya Chalermsook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chalermsook:Parinya", "Julia Chuzhoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuzhoy:Julia", "Alina Ene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ene:Alina", "Shi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shi"], "pages": 20}
