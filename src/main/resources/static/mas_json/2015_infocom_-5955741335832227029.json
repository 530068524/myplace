{"title": "Modeling randomized data streams in caching, data processing, and crawling applications.", "fields": ["random graph", "big data", "streams", "data stream mining", "frequency distribution"], "abstract": "Many BigData applications (e.g., MapReduce, web caching, search in large graphs) process streams of random key-value records that follow highly skewed frequency distributions. In this work, we first develop stochastic models for the probability to encounter unique keys during exploration of such streams and their growth rate over time. We then apply these models to the analysis of LRU caching, MapReduce overhead, and various crawl properties (e.g., node-degree bias, frontier size) in random graphs.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Sarker Tanzir Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Sarker_Tanzir", "Dmitri Loguinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loguinov:Dmitri"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
