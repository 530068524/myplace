Since labelling object boundaries is one of the most expensive types of annotations, there is a need to relax the requirement to carefully annotate images to make both the training more affordable and to extend the amount of training data. In this paper we propose a technique to generate weakly supervised annotations and show that bounding box annotations alone suffice to reach high-quality object boundaries without using any object-specific boundary annotations. With the proposed weak supervision techniques we achieve the top performance on the object boundary detection task, outperforming by a large margin the current fully supervised state-of-theart methods.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "External Organizations"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anna Khoreva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoreva:Anna", "Rodrigo Benenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benenson:Rodrigo", "Mohamed Omran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Omran:Mohamed", "Matthias Hein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hein_0001:Matthias", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 10}
