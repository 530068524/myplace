{"title": "DAGger: clustering correlated uncertain data (to predict asset failure in energy networks).", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "uncertain data", "data mining", "dagger", "machine learning"], "abstract": "DAGger is a clustering algorithm for uncertain data. In contrast to prior work, DAGger can work on arbitrarily correlated data and can compute both exact and approximate clusterings with error guarantees.   We demonstrate DAGger using a real-world scenario in which partial discharge data from UK Power Networks is clustered to predict asset failure in the energy network.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Dan Olteanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olteanu:Dan", "Sebastiaan J. van Schaik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaik:Sebastiaan_J=_van"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
