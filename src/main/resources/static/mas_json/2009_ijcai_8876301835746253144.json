POSSIBLE WINNER is NP-complete for common voting rules such as Borda, many other positional scoring rules, Bucklin, Copeland etc. We investigate how three different parameterizations influence the computational complexity of POSSIBLE WINNER for a number of voting rules. We show fixed-parameter tractability results with respect to the parameter \"number of candidates\" but intractability results with respect to the parameter \"number of votes\". Finally, we derive fixed-parameter tractability results with respect to the parameter \"total number of undetermined candidate pairs\" and identify an interesting polynomial-time solvable special case for Borda.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "departments": ["University of Jena", "University of Jena", "University of Jena"], "authors": ["Nadja Betzler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Betzler:Nadja", "Susanne Hemmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hemmann:Susanne", "Rolf Niedermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niedermeier:Rolf"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
