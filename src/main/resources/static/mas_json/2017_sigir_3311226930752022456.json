{"title": "POI Popularity Prediction via Hierarchical Fusion of Multiple Social Clues.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "popularity", "point of interest", "scarcity", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Predicting the popularity of Point of Interest (POI) has become increasingly crucial for location-based services, such as POI recommendation. Most of the existing methods can seldom achieve satisfactory performance due to the scarcity of POI's information, which tendentiously confines the recommendation to popular scenic spots, and ignores the unpopular attractions with potentially precious values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed  Hierarchical Multi-Clue Fusion  (HMCF), for predicting the popularity of POIs. Specifically, we devise an effective hierarchy to comprehensively describe POI by integrating various types of media information (e.g., image and text) from multiple social sources. For each individual POI, we simultaneously inject semantic knowledge as well as multi-clue representative power. We collect a multi-source POI dataset from four widely-used tourism platforms. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of predicting the attractions' popularity as compared to several baselines.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Queensland", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Yaqian Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Yaqian", "Xinze Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinze", "Yang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Yang", "Zi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zi", "Ning Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0003:Ning", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
