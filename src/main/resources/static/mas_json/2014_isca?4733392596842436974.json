{"title": "HELIX-RC: An architecture-compiler co-design for automatic parallelization of irregular programs.", "fields": ["dependence analysis", "multi core processor", "speedup", "thread", "automatic parallelization"], "abstract": "Data dependences in sequential programs limit parallelization because extracted threads cannot run independently. Although thread-level speculation can avoid the need for precise dependence analysis, communication overheads required to synchronize actual dependences counteract the benefits of parallelization. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight architectural enhancement co-designed with a parallelizing compiler, which together can decouple communication from thread execution. Simulations of these approaches, applied to a processor with 16 Intel Atom-like cores, show an average of 6.85x performance speedup for six SPEC CINT2000 benchmarks", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Simone Campanoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Campanoni:Simone", "Kevin Brownell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brownell:Kevin", "Svilen Kanev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanev:Svilen", "Timothy M.
