{"title": "m-Transportability: Transportability of a Causal Effect from Multiple Environments.", "fields": ["observational study", "exploit", "completeness", "domain adaptation", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We study m-transportability, a generalization of transportability, which offers a license to use causal information elicited from experiments and observations in m \u2265 1 source environments to estimate a causal effect in a given target environment. We provide a novel characterization of m- transportability that directly exploits the completeness of do-calculus to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for m-transportability. We provide an algorithm for deciding m- transportability that determines whether a causal relation is m-transportable; and if it is, produces a transport formula, that is, a recipe for estimating the desired causal effect by combining experimental information from m source environments with observational information from the target environment.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Sanghack Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sanghack", "Vasant G.
