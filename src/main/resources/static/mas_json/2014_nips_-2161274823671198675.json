Our model enables Bayesian inference in contexts when standard techniques like Gaussian process inference are too expensive to apply. Exact inference on our model is possible for any likelihood function from the exponential family. Inference is then highly efficient, requiring only O (log N) time and O (N) space at run time. We demonstrate our algorithm on several problems and show quantifiable improvement in both speed and performance relative to models based on the Gaussian process.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["William Vega-Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vega=Brown:William", "Marek Doniec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doniec:Marek", "Nicholas Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Nicholas"], "pages": 9}
