We propose a new multi-version concurrency control algorithm called, serializable generalized snapshot isolation (SGSI), that targets middleware replicated database systems. Each replica runs snapshot isolation locally and the replication middleware guarantees global one-copy serializability. We introduce novel techniques to provide a stronger global isolation level, namely readset extraction and enhanced certification that prevents read-write and write-write conflicts in a replicated setting. We prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm, and build a prototype replicated database system to evaluate SGSI performance experimentally. Extensive experiments with an 8 replica database system under the TPC-W workload mixes demonstrate the practicality and low overhead of the algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Sydney", "Athens U. of Ec ... usiness, Greece"], "authors": ["Mihaela A.
