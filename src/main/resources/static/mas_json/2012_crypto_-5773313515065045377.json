{"title": "New Impossibility Results for Concurrent Composition and a Non-interactive Completeness Theorem for Secure Computation.", "fields": ["impossibility", "oblivious transfer", "zero knowledge proof", "binary erasure channel", "godel s completeness theorem"], "abstract": "We consider the client-server setting for the concurrent composition of secure protocols: in this setting, a single server interacts with multiple clients concurrently, executing with each client a specified protocol where only the client should receive any nontrivial output. Such a setting is easily motivated from an application standpoint. There are important special cases for which positive results are known \u2013 such as concurrent zero knowledge protocols \u2013 and it has been an open question whether other natural functionalities such as Oblivious Transfer (OT) are possible in this setting.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Microsoft", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Shweta Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Shweta", "Vipul Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Vipul", "Abhishek Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0002:Abhishek", "Manoj Prabhakaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakaran:Manoj", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 18}
