This paper presents Tweetviz, an interactive tool to help businesses extract actionable information from a large set of noisy Twitter messages. Tweetviz visualizes the tweet sentiment of business locations, identifies other business venues that Twitter users visit, and estimates some simple demographics of the Twitter users frequenting a business. A user study to evaluate the system's ability indicates that Tweetviz can provide an overview of a business's issues and sentiment as well as information aiding users in creating customer profiles.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory"], "authors": ["Bas Sijtsma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sijtsma:Bas", "Pernilla Qvarfordt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qvarfordt:Pernilla", "Francine Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Francine"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
