{"title": "Here's my cert, so trust me, maybe?: understanding TLS errors on the web.", "fields": ["attention span", "data set", "false positive paradox", "end user", "novelty"], "abstract": "When browsers report TLS errors, they cannot distinguish between attacks and harmless server misconfigurations; hence they leave it to the user to decide whether continuing is safe. However, actual attacks remain rare. As a result, users quickly become used to \"false positives\" that deplete their attention span, making it unlikely that they will pay sufficient scrutiny when a real attack comes along. Consequently, browser vendors should aim to minimize the number of low-risk warnings they report. To guide that process, we perform a large-scale measurement study of common TLS warnings. Using a set of passive network monitors located at different sites, we identify the prevalence of warnings for a total population of about 300,000 users over a nine-month period. We identify low-risk scenarios that consume a large chunk of the user attention budget and make concrete recommendations to browser vendors that will help maintain user attention in high-risk situations. We study the impact on end users with a data set much larger in scale than the data sets used in previous TLS measurement studies. A key novelty of our approach involves the use of internal browser code instead of generic TLS libraries for analysis, providing more accurate and representative results.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "International Computer Science Institute", "University of California, Berkeley", "International Computer Science Institute"], "authors": ["Devdatta Akhawe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akhawe:Devdatta", "Bernhard Amann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amann:Bernhard", "Matthias Vallentin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vallentin:Matthias", "Robin Sommer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sommer:Robin"], "conf": "www", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
