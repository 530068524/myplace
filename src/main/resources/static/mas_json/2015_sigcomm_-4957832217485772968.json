{"title": "Condor: Better Topologies Through Declarative Design.", "fields": ["distributed computing", "real time computing", "trade off", "multipath propagation", "network topology"], "abstract": "The design space for large, multipath datacenter networks is large and complex, and no one design fits all purposes. Network architects must trade off many criteria to design cost-effective, reliable, and maintainable networks, and typically cannot explore much of the design space. We present Condor, our approach to enabling a rapid, efficient design cycle. Condor allows architects to express their requirements as constraints via a Topology Description Language (TDL), rather than having to directly specify network structures. Condor then uses constraint-based synthesis to rapidly generate candidate topologies, which can be analyzed against multiple criteria. We show that TDL supports concise descriptions of topologies such as fat-trees, BCube, and DCell; that we can generate known and novel variants of fat-trees with simple changes to a TDL file; and that we can synthesize large topologies in tens of seconds. We also show that Condor supports the daunting task of designing multi-phase network expansions that can be carried out on live networks.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Brandon Schlinker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlinker:Brandon", "Radhika Niranjan Mysore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mysore:Radhika_Niranjan", "Sean Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Sean", "Jeffrey C.
