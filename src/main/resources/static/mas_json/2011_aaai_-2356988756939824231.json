However, existing approaches, largely syntactic content-based, fail to provide robust, accurate and useful personalized services to its users. Towards such an issue, the semantic web provides technologies to annotate and match services' descriptions with users' features, interests and preferences, thus allowing for more efficient access to services and more generally information. The aim of our work, part of service personalization, is on automated instantiation of services which is crucial for advanced usability i.e., how to prepare and present services ready to be executed while limiting useless interactions with users? We introduce the constructive Description Logics reasoning join and couple it with concept abduction to i) identify useful parts of users profiles that satisfy services requirements and ii) compute the description required by a service to be executed but not provided by users profiles.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Manchester"], "authors": ["Freddy L\u00e9cu\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=eacute=cu=eacute=:Freddy"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
