Whereas the first includes health-related physiological signals, the latter provides insights into a user's behavior. However, the two sources of data have largely been studied in isolation. We analyze public data from users who have chosen to connect their MyFitnessPal and Twitter accounts. We show that a user's diet compliance success, measured via their self-logged food diaries, can be predicted using features derived from social media: linguistic, activity, and social capital. We find that users with more positive affect and a larger social network are more successful in succeeding in their dietary goals. Using a Granger causality methodology, we also show that social media can help predict daily changes in diet compliance success or failure with an accuracy of 77%, that improves over baseline techniques by 17%. We discuss the implications of our work in the design of improved health interventions for behavior change.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Munmun De Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Munmun_De", "Mrinal Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Mrinal", "Ingmar Weber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weber:Ingmar"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 16}
