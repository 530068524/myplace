Virtual photos and videos serve as threedimensional references to objects, places, moments in time and activities of users. Our Photoportals also provide access to intermediate or alternative versions of a scenario and allow the review of recorded task sequences that include life-size representations of the captured users. We propose to exploit such references to structure collaborative activities of collocated and remote users. Photoportals offer additional access points for multiple users and encourage mutual support through the preparation and provision of references for manipulation and navigation tasks. They support the pattern of territoriality with configurable space representations that can be used for private interaction, as well as be shared and exchanged with others.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Bauhaus University, Weimar", "Weimar Institute", "Bauhaus University, Weimar", "Weimar Institute"], "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Kunert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunert:Andr=eacute=", "Alexander Kulik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulik:Alexander", "Stephan Beck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beck:Stephan", "Bernd Froehlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Froehlich_0001:Bernd"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
