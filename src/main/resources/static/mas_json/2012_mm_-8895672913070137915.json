Examples of such interactive media include video-on-demand, massive multiplayer virtual environments, massively multiplayer online game, zoomable video, Google Earth, and free-viewpoint video. To enable scalable delivery of these media contents to potentially millions of users, P2P architecture is often adopted. Non-linear and non-continuous user access pattern, however, pose new challenges on P2P interactive media streaming systems. These challenges include the need of more sophisticated prefetching scheme, increasing server load, high demand for short content discovery time, and difficulty of bandwidth allocation. We first try to understand the effect of non-linear and non-continuous media access on the streaming system performance, in particular, the server load, through analytical modeling. Then a novel user access pattern driven content discovery mechanism is proposed to address the content discovery challenge during non-continuous access. Works aiming at the rest of challenges are ongoing.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Zhen Wei Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhen_Wei"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
