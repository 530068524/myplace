ManX regularizes document fusion scores, so that documents that appear within a manifold, receive similar scores, whereas v-ManX first generates \\emph{virtual} adversarial documents and then regularizes the fusion scores of both original and virtual adversarial documents. Since aggregation methods built on the cluster hypothesis are computationally expensive, we adopt an optimization method that uses the top-k documents as \\emph{anchors} and considerably reduces the computational complexity of manifold-based methods, resulting in two efficient aggregation approaches, a-ManX and a-v-ManX. We assess the proposed approaches experimentally and show that they significantly outperform the state-of-the-art aggregation approaches, while a-ManX and a-v-ManX run faster than ManX, v-ManX, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "JD.com, Beijing, China"], "authors": ["Shangsong Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Shangsong", "Ilya Markov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markov:Ilya", "Zhaochun Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Zhaochun", "Maarten de Rijke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rijke:Maarten_de"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
