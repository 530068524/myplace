{"title": "Cluster-based color space optimizations.", "fields": ["color depth", "color histogram", "color balance", "color model", "icc profile"], "abstract": "Transformations between different color spaces and gamuts are ubiquitous operations performed on images. Often, these transformations involve information loss, for example when mapping from color to grayscale for printing, from multispectral or multiprimary data to tristimulus spaces, or from one color gamut to another. In all these applications, there exists a straightforward \u201cnatural\u201d mapping from the source space to the target space, but the mapping is not bijective, resulting in information loss due to metamerism and similar effects. We propose a cluster-based approach for optimizing the transformation for individual images in a way that preserves as much of the information as possible from the source space while staying as faithful as possible to the natural mapping. Our approach can be applied to a host of color transformation problems including color to gray, gamut mapping, conversion of multispectral and multiprimary data to tristimulus colors, and image optimization for color deficient viewers.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "Bangor University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Cheryl Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Cheryl", "Wolfgang Heidrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heidrich:Wolfgang", "Rafal Mantiuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mantiuk:Rafal"], "pages": 8}
