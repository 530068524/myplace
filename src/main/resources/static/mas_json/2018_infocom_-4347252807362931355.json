We consider a pair of pedestrians connected through a D2D link. The pedestrians seek to reach their respective destinations while using the D2D link for data exchange applications such as file transfer, video calling, and online gaming. In order to enable better D2D connectivity, the pedestrians are willing to deviate from their respective shortest paths, at the cost of reaching their destinations slightly late. A generic trajectory optimization problem is formulated and solved for the case when full information about the problem in known in advance. \nMotivated by the D2D user's need to keep their destinations private, we also formulate a regularized variant of the problem that can be used to develop a fully online algorithm. The proposed online algorithm is quite efficient, and is shown to achieve a sublinear \\emph{offline} regret while satisfying the required mobility constraints exactly. The theoretical results are backed by detailed numerical tests that establish the efficacy of the proposed algorithms under various settings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Amrit S.
