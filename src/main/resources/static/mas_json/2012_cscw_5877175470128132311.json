To better understand game variants, we use a grounded approach to analyze 62 variants for Texas Hold'em, a popular card game, and a follow-up case-study of 91 variants of Halo 2, a popular video game. We study their development and examine whether lessons from Texas Hold'em apply to a constrained system such as Halo 2. We discover video gamers' reliance on 'honor rules', rules dependent on the cooperative spirit of its players. We develop a theory of 'necessity' in rule adoption, showing players' sensitivity to the impact of one change on the whole game. In solving game-design problems, adjustments drawn from a set of 'canned' rule changes address common problems with familiar solutions. We find a complex interplay between who can play and what rules are chosen. Our findings have implications for game designers and for variants in non-game contexts.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Gifford Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Gifford", "Jeff Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0002:Jeff"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
