Ongoing research is focused toward making the algorithms even more general, as well as to better understand their behavior with respect to issues such as the choice of the weighting function and sensitivity to placement of seeds. In this paper, we investigate in the context of neuroimaging segmentation, the sensitivity/stability of the solution with respect to the input \u201clabels\u201d or \u201cseeds\u201d. In particular, as a form of parameter learning, we are interested in the effect of allowing the given set of labels (and consequently, the response/statistics of the weighting function) to vary for obtaining lower energy segmentation solutions. This perturbation leads to a \u201crefined\u201d label set (or parameters) better suited to the input image, yielding segmentations that are less sensitive to the set of labels or seeds provided. Our proposed algorithm (using Parametric Pseudoflow) yields improvements over graph-cuts based segmentation with a fixed set of labels. We present experiments on about 450 3-D brain image volumes demonstrating the efficacy of the algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Epic Systems In ... adison, WI, USA"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Dylan Hower.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hower:Dylan", "Vikas Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Vikas", "Sterling C.
