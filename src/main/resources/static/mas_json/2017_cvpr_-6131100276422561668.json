{"title": "Multi-view Supervision for Single-View Reconstruction via Differentiable Ray Consistency.", "fields": ["solid modeling", "iterative reconstruction", "probabilistic logic", "semantics", "differentiable function"], "abstract": "We study the notion of consistency between a 3D shape and a 2D observation and propose a differentiable formulation which allows computing gradients of the 3D shape given an observation from an arbitrary view. We do so by reformulating view consistency using a differentiable ray consistency (DRC) term. We show that this formulation can be incorporated in a learning framework to leverage different types of multi-view observations e.g. foreground masks, depth, color images, semantics etc. as supervision for learning single-view 3D prediction. We present empirical analysis of our technique in a controlled setting. We also show that this approach allows us to improve over existing techniques for single-view reconstruction of objects from the PASCAL VOC dataset.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shubham Tulsiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tulsiani:Shubham", "Tinghui Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Tinghui", "Alexei A.
