Its applications in computer vision include motion segmentation in video, structure-from-motion, and image clustering. In this work, we describe a novel approach for subspace segmentation that uses probabilistic inference via a message-passing algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Nevena Lazic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazic:Nevena", "Inmar E.
