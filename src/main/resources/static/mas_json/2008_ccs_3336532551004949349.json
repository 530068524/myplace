We show how certain properties offered by zero-knowledge proofs can be characterized in terms of authorization policies and statically enforced by a type system. The analysis is modular and compositional, and provides security proofs for an unbounded number of protocol executions. We develop a new type-checker that conducts the analysis in a fully automated manner. We exemplify the applicability of our technique to real-world protocols by verifying the authenticity and secrecy properties of the Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) protocol. The analysis of DAA takes less than three seconds.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Michael Backes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Backes_0001:Michael", "Catalin Hritcu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hritcu:Catalin", "Matteo Maffei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maffei:Matteo"], "pages": 14}
