This paper tackles this challenging and essentially underdetermined problem by regression on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) features, combined with a post-processing refining step using conditional random fields (CRF). Our framework works at two levels, super-pixel level and pixel level. First, we design a DCNN model to learn the mapping from multi-scale image patches to depth or surface normal values at the super-pixel level. Second, the estimated super-pixel depth or surface normal is refined to the pixel level by exploiting various potentials on the depth or surface normal map, which includes a data term, a smoothness term among super-pixels and an auto-regression term characterizing the local structure of the estimation map. The inference problem can be efficiently solved because it admits a closed-form solution. Experiments on the Make3D and NYU Depth V2 datasets show competitive results compared with recent state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Northwestern Polytechnical University", "University of Adelaide", "Australian National University", "University of Adelaide", "Northwestern Polytechnical University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Bo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0004:Bo", "Chunhua Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chunhua", "Yuchao Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Yuchao", "Anton van den Hengel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hengel:Anton_van_den", "Mingyi He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Mingyi"], "pages": 9}
