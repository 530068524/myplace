In this paper, we investigate cases where coincidences in daily activities lead to casual conversation and thus intimacy and togetherness. We propose a new method of communicating these \"happy coincidences\" between a pair of remotely located locations. By equipping furniture and appliances such as doors, sofas, refrigerators and televisions with sensors, we developed a system wherein these items are connected to remote equivalents and their near simultaneous use is communicated. We conducted a two month field test of the system in a laboratory setting and a three month field test in an actual home. The study showed that the participant felt the presence of other people and thought about, imagined or even confirmed the habits of others by intentionally triggering the coincidence notification.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Ochanomizu University", "Ochanomizu University", "Ochanomizu University"], "authors": ["Hitomi Tsujita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsujita:Hitomi", "Koji Tsukada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsukada:Koji", "Itiro Siio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siio:Itiro"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
