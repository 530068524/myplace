{"title": "MAP Disparity Estimation Using Hidden Markov Trees.", "fields": ["standard test image", "spanning tree", "maximum a posteriori estimation", "forward algorithm", "markov model"], "abstract": "A new method is introduced for stereo matching that operates on minimum spanning trees (MSTs) generated from the images. Disparity maps are represented as a collection of hidden states on MSTs, and each MST is modeled as a hidden Markov tree. An efficient recursive message-passing scheme designed to operate on hidden Markov trees, known as the upward-downward algorithm, is used to compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP) disparity estimate at each pixel. The messages processed by the upward-downward algorithm involve two types of probabilities: the probability of a pixel having a particular disparity given a set of per-pixel matching costs, and the probability of a disparity transition between a pair of connected pixels given their similarity. The distributions of these probabilities are modeled from a collection of images with ground truth disparities. Performance evaluation using the Middlebury stereo benchmark version 3 demonstrates that the proposed method ranks second and third in terms of overall accuracy when evaluated on the training and test image sets, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "Electrical & Co ... ter Engineering"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Eric T.
