This approach can handle dynamically changing scene geometry and dynamically changing light sources in real time with a single mobile RGB-D sensor and without relying on an invasive lightprobe. We jointly filter both in-view dynamic geometry and outside-view static geometry. The resulting reconstruction provides the input for efficient global illumination computation in image-space. We demonstrate that our approach can deliver state-of-the-art Augmented Reality rendering effects for scenes that are more scalable and more dynamic than previous work.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "University of Colorado Colorado Springs", "Graz University of Technology"], "authors": ["Lukas Gruber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gruber:Lukas", "Jonathan Ventura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Ventura:Jonathan", "Dieter Schmalstieg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmalstieg:Dieter"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
