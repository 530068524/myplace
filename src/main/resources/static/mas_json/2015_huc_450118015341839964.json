Exposure to ubicomp technologies is most accessible through the maker movement. With this in mind we argue we must move from computational thinking to computational making as an educational framework. Here we present a case study of children's making to support our vision for a broader conception of computational making.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen"], "authors": ["Jennifer A.
