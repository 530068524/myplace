Mixtures-of-trees generalize the probabilistic trees of Chow and Liu (1968) in a different and complementary direction to that of Bayesian networks. We present efficient algorithms for learning mixtures-of-trees models in maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks. We also discuss additional efficiencies that can be obtained when data are \"sparse,\" and we present data structures and algorithms that exploit such sparseness. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the model for both density estimation and classification. We also discuss the sense in which tree-based classifiers perform an implicit form of feature selection, and demonstrate a resulting insensitivity to irrelevant attributes.", "citation": "Citations (454)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of California, Berkeley", "University College Dublin", "University College Dublin", "University of Oxford", "Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of New Mexico", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of South Florida", "Florida State University", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Technical University of Berlin", "Institut de Mat ... dex 09, France", "Applied Mathema ... , France 75270"], "authors": ["Parikshit Ram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ram:Parikshit", "Alexander G.
