{"title": "Predicting postcompletion errors using eye movements.", "fields": ["cognition", "graphical user interface", "eye tracking", "eye movement", "word error rate"], "abstract": "A postcompletion error is a distinct type of procedural error where one fails to complete the final step of a task. While redesigning interfaces and providing explicit cues have been shown to be effective in reducing the postcompletion error rate, these methods are not always feasible or well liked. This paper demonstrates how specific eye movement measures can be used to predict when a user will make a postcompletion error. We describe a real-time eye gaze system that provides cues to the user if and only if there is a high probability of the user making a postcompletion error.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["George Mason University", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Raj M.
