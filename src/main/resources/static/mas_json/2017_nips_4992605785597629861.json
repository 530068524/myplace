This approach relies on a complicated fine-tuning procedure and an attention scheme that forms a distribution over all points in the support set, scaling poorly with its size. We propose a more streamlined approach, prototypical networks, that learns a metric space in which few-shot classification can be performed by computing Euclidean distances to prototype representations of each class, rather than individual points. Our method is competitive with state-of-the-art one-shot classification approaches while being much simpler and more scalable with the size of the support set. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our approach on the Omniglot and mini-ImageNet datasets. We further demonstrate that a similar idea can be used for zero-shot learning, where each class is described by a set of attributes, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the Caltech UCSD bird dataset.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Google", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jake Snell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snell:Jake", "Kevin Swersky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swersky:Kevin", "Richard S.
