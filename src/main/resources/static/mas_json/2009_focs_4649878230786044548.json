The most loaded bin then has log n/log log n balls with high probability. A famous result of Aztar, Brooder, Karolin and Opal states that, when given k uniformly and independently selected bins to choose from for the location of each ball, one can achieve a maximal load of log_k log n, simply by putting each ball in the least loaded of the k bins. To implement this simple algorithm, one needs to keep track of the status of the entire array of n bins, which requires about n bits of memory. In this work, we find a tradeoff between the number of choices, k, and the number of memory bits available, m. This tradeoff has a sharp threshold governing the performance: If km\u226b\u226bn then one can achieve a constant maximal load.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Tel Aviv University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Noga Alon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alon:Noga", "Eyal Lubetzky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lubetzky:Eyal", "Ori Gurel-Gurevich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurel=Gurevich:Ori"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
