{"title": "Gentrification gone too far? affordable 2nd-class values for fun and (co-)effect.", "fields": ["argument of a function", "special case", "parametricity", "memory safety", "scala"], "abstract": "First-class functions dramatically increase expressiveness, at the expense of static guarantees. In ALGOL or PASCAL, functions could be passed as arguments but never escape their defining scope. Therefore, function arguments could serve as temporary access tokens or capabilities, enabling callees to perform some action, but only for the duration of the call. In modern languages, such programming patterns are no longer available.   The central thrust of this paper is to re-introduce second-class functions and other values alongside first-class entities in modern languages. We formalize second-class values with stack-bounded lifetimes as an extension to simply-typed I\ufffd calculus, and for richer type systems such as F   and systems with path-dependent types. We generalize the binary first- vs second-class distinction to arbitrary privilege lattices, with the underlying type lattice as a special case. In this setting, abstract types naturally enable privilege parametricity. We prove type soundness and lifetime properties in Coq.   We implement our system as an extension of Scala, and present several case studies. First, we modify the Scala Collections library and add privilege annotations to all higher-order functions. Privilege parametricity is key to retain the high degree of code-reuse between sequential and parallel as well as lazy and eager collections. Second, we use scoped capabilities to introduce a model of checked exceptions in the Scala library, with only few changes to the code. Third, we employ second-class capabilities for memory safety in a region-based off-heap memory library.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Leo Osvald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osvald:Leo", "Gr\u00e9gory M.
