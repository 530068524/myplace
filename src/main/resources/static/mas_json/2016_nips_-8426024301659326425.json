We propose XOR_MMAP, a novel approach to solve the Marginal MAP problem, which represents the intractable counting subproblem with queries to NP oracles, subject to additional parity constraints. XOR_MMAP provides a constant factor approximation to the Marginal MAP problem, by encoding it as a single optimization in a polynomial size of the original problem. We evaluate our approach in several machine learning and decision-making applications, and show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art Marginal MAP solvers.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Tsinghua University", "Stanford University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Yexiang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Yexiang", "Zhiyuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhiyuan", "Stefano Ermon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ermon:Stefano", "Carla P.
