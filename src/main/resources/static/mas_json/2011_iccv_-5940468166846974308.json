{"title": "Understanding scenes on many levels.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "markov random field", "category theory", "doors", "parsing"], "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for image parsing with multiple label sets. For example, we may want to simultaneously label every image region according to its basic-level object category (car, building, road, tree, etc.), superordinate category (animal, vehicle, manmade object, natural object, etc.), geometric orientation (horizontal, vertical, etc.), and material (metal, glass, wood, etc.). Some object regions may also be given part names (a car can have wheels, doors, windshield, etc.). We compute co-occurrence statistics between different label types of the same region to capture relationships such as \u201croads are horizontal,\u201d \u201ccars are made of metal,\u201d \u201ccars have wheels\u201d but \u201chorses have legs,\u201d and so on. By incorporating these constraints into a Markov Random Field inference framework and jointly solving for all the label sets, we are able to improve the classification accuracy for all the label sets at once, achieving a richer form of image understanding.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Joseph Tighe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tighe:Joseph", "Svetlana Lazebnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazebnik:Svetlana"], "pages": 8}
