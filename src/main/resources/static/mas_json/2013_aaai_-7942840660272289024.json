When evaluated using benchmark maps from Dragon Age\u2122, DBA* requires less time for search and produces less suboptimal paths than the PRA* implementation used in Dragon Age\u2122.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["William Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:William", "Ramon Lawrence.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lawrence:Ramon"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
