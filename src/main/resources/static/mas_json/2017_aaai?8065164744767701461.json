The use of a norm-preserving transition operator can address this issue, but parametrization is challenging. In this work we focus on unitary operators and describe a parametrization using the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{u}(n)$ associated with the Lie group $U(n)$ of $n \\times n$ unitary matrices. The exponential map provides a correspondence between these spaces, and allows us to define a unitary matrix using $n^2$ real coefficients relative to a basis of the Lie algebra. The parametrization is closed under additive updates of these coefficients, and thus provides a simple space in which to do gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this parametrization on the problem of learning arbitrary unitary operators, comparing to several baselines and outperforming a recently-proposed lower-dimensional parametrization. We additionally use our parametrization to generalize a recently-proposed unitary recurrent neural network to arbitrary unitary matrices, using it to solve standard long-memory tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Kettering University"], "authors": ["Stephanie L.
