We observe that existing distance metrics work primarily for low complexity cases. In this paper, we develop a novel distance metric for grouping two superpixels in high-complexity scenarios. Combining them, a complexity-adaptive distance measure is produced that achieves improved grouping in different levels of complexity. Our extensive experimentation shows that our method can achieve good results in the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset surpassing the latest state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yao Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Yao", "Cewu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Cewu", "Efstratios Tsougenis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsougenis:Efstratios", "Yongyi Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yongyi", "Chi-Keung Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Chi=Keung"], "pages": 9}
