{"title": "Robust Bloom Filters for Large MultiLabel Classification Tasks.", "fields": ["binary classification", "binary number", "inference", "sublinear function", "bloom filter"], "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to multilabel classification (MLC) with a large number of labels. Our approach is a reduction to binary classification in which label sets are represented by low dimensional binary vectors. This representation follows the principle of Bloom filters, a space-efficient data structure originally designed for approximate membership testing. We show that a naive application of Bloom filters in MLC is not robust to individual binary classifiers' errors. We then present an approach that exploits a specific feature of real-world datasets when the number of labels is large: many labels (almost) never appear together. Our approach is provably robust, has sublinear training and inference complexity with respect to the number of labels, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art algorithms on two large scale multilabel datasets.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Paris", "University of Paris"], "authors": ["Moustapha Ciss\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciss=eacute=:Moustapha", "Nicolas Usunier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Usunier:Nicolas", "Thierry Arti\u00e8res.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arti=egrave=res:Thierry", "Patrick Gallinari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gallinari:Patrick"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
