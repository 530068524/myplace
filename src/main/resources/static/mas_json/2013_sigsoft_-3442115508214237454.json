However, the confounding configuration choice problem poses a widely-acknowledged threat to the validity of previous empirical analyses. We introduce desktop and parallelised cloud-deployed versions of a search based solution that finds suitable configurations for empirical studies. We evaluate our approach on 6 widely used clone detection tools applied to the Bellon suite of 8 subject systems. Our evaluation reports the results of 9.3 million total executions of a clone tool; the largest study yet reported. Our approach finds significantly better configurations (p", "citation": "Citations (113)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Tiantian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Tiantian", "Mark Harman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harman:Mark", "Yue Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yue", "Jens Krinke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krinke:Jens"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 11}
