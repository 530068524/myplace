{"title": "Hitting sets for multilinear read-once algebraic branching programs, in any order.", "fields": ["diagonal", "wronskian", "partial derivative", "multilinear map", "polynomial identity testing"], "abstract": "We give deterministic black-box polynomial identity testing algorithms for multilinear read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs (ROABPs), in  n  O (log 2   n ) time. Further, our algorithm is oblivious to the order of the variables. This is the first sub-exponential time algorithm for this model. Furthermore, our result has no known analogue in the model of read-once oblivious  boolean  branching programs with unknown order.   We obtain our results by recasting, and improving upon, the ideas of Agrawal, Saha and Saxena [ASS13]. We phrase the ideas in terms of  rank condensers  and  Wronskians , and show that our results improve upon the classical multivariate Wronskian, which may be of independent interest.   In addition, we give the first  n   O (lg lg  n )  black-box polynomial identity testing algorithm for the so called model of diagonal circuits. This result improves upon the  n  \u0398(lg  n ) -time algorithms given by Agrawal, Saha and Saxena [ASS13], and Forbes and Shpilka [FS13b] for this class. More generally, our result holds for any model computing polynomials whose partial derivatives (of all orders) span a low dimensional linear space.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Michael A.
