Yet due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem, previous works usually rely on severe approximations so that it is still an open problem. We propose a new learning algorithm that relies on non-convex optimization and bundle methods and allows tackling the original optimization problem as is. It is proved to converge to a solution with accuracy e with a rate O (1/e). We provide experimental results gained on speech and handwriting recognition that demonstrate the potential of the method.", "citation": "Citations (120)", "departments": ["Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "authors": ["Trinh Minh Tri Do.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Do:Trinh_Minh_Tri", "Thierry Arti\u00e8res.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arti=egrave=res:Thierry"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
