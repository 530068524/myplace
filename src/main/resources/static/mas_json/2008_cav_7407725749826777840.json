{"title": "The CASPA Tool: Causality-Based Abstraction for Security Protocol Analysis.", "fields": ["expressivity", "authentication protocol", "mathematical proof", "secrecy", "universal composability"], "abstract": "CASPA constitutes a push-button tool for automatically proving secrecy and authenticity properties of cryptographic protocols. The tool is grounded on a novel technique for causality-based abstraction of protocol executions that allows establishing proofs of security for an unbounded number of concurrent protocol executions in an automated manner. We demonstrate the expressiveness and efficiency of the tool by drawing a comparison with T4ASP, the static analyzer for secrecy properties offered by the AVISPA tool.  CASPA is capable of coping with a substantially larger set of protocols, and excels in performance.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Michael Backes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Backes_0001:Michael", "Stefan Lorenz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lorenz:Stefan", "Matteo Maffei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maffei:Matteo", "Kim Pecina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pecina:Kim"], "pages": 4}
