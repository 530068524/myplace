Previously, sentiment analysis was mostly studied under data-driven and lexicon-based frameworks. Such work generally exploits textual features for fact-based analysis tasks or lexical indicators from a sentiment lexicon. We propose to model term weighting into a sentiment analysis system utilizing collection statistics, contextual and topic-related characteristics as well as opinion-related properties. Experiments carried out on various datasets show that our approach effectively improves previous methods.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jungi Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jungi", "Jinji Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jinji", "Jong-Hyeok Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jong=Hyeok"], "pages": 9}
