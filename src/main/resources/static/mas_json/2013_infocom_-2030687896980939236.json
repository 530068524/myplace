However, those works either require secure pair-wise communication channels or suffer from high complexity. In this paper, we consider how an external aggregator or multiple parties can learn some algebraic statistics (e.g., sum, product) over participants' privately owned data while preserving the data privacy. We assume all channels are subject to eavesdropping attacks, and all the communications throughout the aggregation are open to others. We propose several protocols that successfully guarantee data privacy under this weak assumption while limiting both the communication and computation complexity of each participant to a small constant.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Taeho Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Taeho", "XuFei Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:XuFei", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie", "Wei Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Wei", "Lan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
