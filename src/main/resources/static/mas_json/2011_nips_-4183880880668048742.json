In particular, we infer the scene topology, geometry as well as traffic activities from a short video sequence acquired with a single camera mounted on a moving car. Our generative model takes advantage of dynamic information in the form of vehicle tracklets as well as static information coming from semantic labels and geometry (i.e., vanishing points). Experiments show that our approach outperforms a discriminative baseline based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) which has access to the same image information. Furthermore, as we reason about objects in 3D, we are able to significantly increase the performance of state-of-the-art object detectors in their ability to estimate object orientation.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "MPI Saarbr\u00fccken", "TTI Chicago"], "authors": ["Andreas Geiger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geiger:Andreas", "Christian Wojek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wojek:Christian", "Raquel Urtasun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urtasun:Raquel"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
