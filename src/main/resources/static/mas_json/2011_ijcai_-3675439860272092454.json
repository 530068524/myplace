To meet this challenge, we first introduce a novel continuous-time DEC-MDP model that exploits transition independence in domains with temporal constraints. More importantly, we present a new locally optimal algorithm called SPAC. Compared to the best previous algorithm, SPAC finds solutions of comparable quality substantially faster; SPAC also scales to larger teams of agents.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhengyu Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Zhengyu", "Milind Tambe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tambe:Milind"], "pages": 7}
