We made a pair of CheekTouch prototypes each with a multi-touch screen and vibrotactile display to enable bidirectional touch delivery. We observed four romantic couples in their twenties using our prototype system in a lab setting over five consecutive days, and analyzed how CheekTouch affected their non-verbal and emotional communication. The results of the user study showed that CheekTouch could effectively support audio-tactile communication in various ways - persuading, conveying status, delivering information, emphasizing emotion/words, calling for attention, and being playful.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "Korea Advanced  ... public of Korea"], "authors": ["Youngwoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Youngwoo", "Seok-Hyung Bae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bae:Seok=Hyung", "Tek-Jin Nam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nam:Tek=Jin"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
