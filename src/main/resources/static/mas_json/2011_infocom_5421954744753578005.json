We design an opportunistic scheduling algorithm that guarantees all sessions have a bounded worst case delay. The algorithm has no knowledge of the future, but yields throughput-utility that is close to (or better than) that of a T-slot lookahead policy that makes \u201cideal\u201d decisions based on perfect knowledge up to T slots into the future. We then extend the algorithm to treat worst case delay guarantees in multi-hop networks. Our analysis uses a sample-path version of Lyapunov optimization together with a novel virtual queue structure.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "departments": ["University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Michael J.
