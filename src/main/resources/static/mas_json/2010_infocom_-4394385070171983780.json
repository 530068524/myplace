We found that every existing approximation algorithm for this problem is incomplete for k >= 3 in a sense that it does not generate a feasible solution in some UDGs. Based on these observations, we propose a new polynomial time approximation algorithm for computing (3;m)-CDSs. We also show that our algorithm is correct and its approximation ratio is a constant.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Lanzhou University", "Xinjiang University", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Donghyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Donghyun", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0032:Wei", "Xianyue Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xianyue", "Zhao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Zhao", "Weili Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Weili"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
