We demonstrate UpRight by producing BFT versions of the Zookeeper lock service and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Our design choices in UpRight favor simplifying adoption by existing applications; performance is a secondary concern. Despite these priorities, our BFT Zookeeper and BFT HDFS implementations have performance comparable with the originals while providing additional robustness.", "citation": "Citations (179)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Allen Clement.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clement:Allen", "Manos Kapritsos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapritsos:Manos", "Sangmin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sangmin", "Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0009:Yang", "Lorenzo Alvisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alvisi:Lorenzo", "Michael Dahlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dahlin:Michael", "Taylor Riche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riche:Taylor"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2009", "pages": 14}
