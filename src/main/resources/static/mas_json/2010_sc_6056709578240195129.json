In this paper, we show how a network-only simulation can be limited as it does not provide an accurate representation of system performance. We evaluate traditionally used openloop simulations and compare them to closed-loop simulations. Although they use different methodologies, measurements, and metrics, we identify how they can provide very similar results. However, we show how the results of closed-loop simulations do not correlate well with execution-driven simulations. We then add simple extensions to the closed-loop simulation to model the impact of the processor and the memory system and show how the correlation with execution-driven simulations can be improved. The proposed framework/methodology provides a fast simulation time while providing better insights into the impact of network parameters on overall system performance.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Hanjoon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hanjoon", "Seulki Heo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heo:Seulki", "Junghoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Junghoon", "Jaehyuk Huh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huh:Jaehyuk", "John Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:John"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2010", "pages": 1}
