{"title": "A simple, combinatorial algorithm for solving SDD systems in nearly-linear time.", "fields": ["conjugate gradient method", "chebyshev filter", "spanning tree", "diagonally dominant matrix", "recursion"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a simple combinatorial algorithm that solves symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) linear systems in nearly-linear time. It uses little of the machinery that previously appeared to be necessary for a such an algorithm. It does not require recursive preconditioning, spectral sparsification, or even the Chebyshev Method or Conjugate Gradient. After constructing a \"nice\" spanning tree of a graph associated with the linear system, the entire algorithm consists of the repeated application of a simple update rule, which it implements using a lightweight data structure. The algorithm is numerically stable and can be implemented without the increased bit-precision required by previous solvers. As such, the algorithm has the fastest known running time under the standard unit-cost RAM model. We hope the simplicity of the algorithm and the insights yielded by its analysis will be useful in both theory and practice.", "citation": "Citations (148)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jonathan A.
