However, supporting state-dependent action costs admits a more compact representation of many tasks. We investigate how to solve such tasks using heuristic search, with a focus on delete-relaxation heuristics. We first define a generalization of the additive heuristic hadd to such tasks and then discuss different ways of computing it via compilations to tasks with state-independent action costs and more directly by modifying the relaxed planning graph. We evaluate these approaches theoretically and present an implementation of hadd for planning with state-dependent action costs. To our knowledge, this gives rise to the first approach able to handle even the hardest instances of the combinatorial ACADEMIC ADVISING domain from the International Probabilistic Planning Competition (IPPC) 2014.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "authors": ["Florian Gei\u00dfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gei=szlig=er:Florian", "Thomas Keller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keller_0001:Thomas", "Robert Mattm\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mattm=uuml=ller:Robert"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
