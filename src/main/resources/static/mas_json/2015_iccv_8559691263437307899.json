{"title": "Semantic Segmentation with Object Clique Potential.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "segmentation", "systems design", "computation", "clique"], "abstract": "We propose an object clique potential for semantic segmentation. Our object clique potential addresses the misclassified object-part issues arising in solutions based on fully-convolutional networks. Our object clique set, compared to that yielded from segment-proposal-based approaches, is with a significantly smaller size, making our method consume notably less computation. Regarding system design and model formation, our object clique potential can be regarded as a functional complement to local-appearance-based CRF models and works in synergy with these effective approaches for further performance improvement. Extensive experiments verify our method.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Xiaojuan Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Xiaojuan", "Jianping Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jianping", "Shu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shu", "Renjie Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Renjie", "Jiaya Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jiaya"], "pages": 9}
