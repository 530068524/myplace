Typically, it predicts the labels of unlabeled data by minimizing a quadratic objective induced by the graph, which is unfortunately a procedure of polynomial complexity in the sample size n. In this paper, we address this scalability issue by proposing a method that approximately solves the quadratic objective in nearly linear time. The method consists of two steps: it first approximates a graph by a minimum spanning tree, and then solves the tree-induced quadratic objective function in O(n) time which is the main contribution of this work. Extensive experiments show the significant scalability improvement over existing scalable semi-supervised learning methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Yan-Ming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yan=Ming", "Xu-Yao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xu=Yao", "Xiao-Tong Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Xiao=Tong", "Cheng-Lin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Cheng=Lin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
