{"title": "Gazed and Confused: Understanding and Designing Shared Gaze for Remote Collaboration.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "eye tracking", "gaze", "deixis", "multimedia"], "abstract": "People utilize eye gaze as an important cue for monitoring attention and coordinating awareness. This study investigates how remote pairs make use of a graphical representation of their partner's eye-gaze during a tightly-coupled collaborative task. Our results suggest that reproducing shared gaze in a remote collaboration setting makes pairs more accurate when referring to linguistically complex objects by facilitating the production of efficient forms of deictic references. We discuss how the availability of gaze influences coordination strategies and implications for the design of shared gaze in remote collaboration systems.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sarah D'Angelo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=Angelo:Sarah", "Darren Gergle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gergle:Darren"], "pages": 5}
