User uniqueness is determined by learning to what extent the user's item preferences deviate from those of an \"average user\" in the system. Based on this framework, we suggest three different recommendation strategies that trade between uniqueness and conformity. Using two real item datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our uniqueness based recommendation framework.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["IBM", "Yahoo!", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Haggai Roitman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roitman:Haggai", "David Carmel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carmel:David", "Yosi Mass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mass:Yosi", "Iris Eiron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eiron:Iris"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
