Using largely qualitative questionnaire and interview methods we investigate and document a range of technical, organizational and social factors that apparently influence organizational responses to MDE: specifically, its perception as a successful or unsuccessful organizational intervention. We then outline a range of lessons learned. Whilst, as with all qualitative research, these lessons should be interpreted with care, they should also be seen as providing a greater understanding of MDE practice in industry, as well as shedding light on the varied, and occasionally surprising, social, technical and organizational factors that affect success and failure. We conclude by suggesting how the next phase of the research will attempt to investigate some of these issues from a different angle and in greater depth.", "citation": "Citations (337)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "\u00d8stfold University College"], "authors": ["John Edward Hutchinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hutchinson:John_Edward", "Jon Whittle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittle:Jon", "Mark Rouncefield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rouncefield:Mark", "Steinar Kristoffersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kristoffersen:Steinar"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
