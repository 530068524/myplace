{"title": "On Broken Triangles.", "fields": ["constraint satisfaction", "merge", "arity", "time complexity", "binary number"], "abstract": "A binary CSP instance satisfying the broken-triangle property (BTP) can be solved in polynomial time. Unfortunately, in practice, few instances satisfy the BTP. We show that a local version of the BTP allows the merging of domain values in binary CSPs, thus providing a novel polynomial-time reduction operation. Experimental trials on benchmark instances demonstrate a significant decrease in instance size for certain classes of problems. We show that BTP-merging can be generalised to instances with constraints of arbitrary arity. A directional version of the general-arity BTP then allows us to extend the BTP tractable class previously defined only for binary CSP.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Toulouse", "Aix-Marseille University", "Aix-Marseille University", "GREYC, Normandie University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Martin C.
