{"title": "Going deeper with convolutions.", "fields": ["theano", "object detection", "convolutional neural network", "resnet", "contextual image classification"], "abstract": "We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed Inception that achieves the new state of the art for classification and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC14). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.", "citation": "Citations (9,524)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Google", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Google", "Google", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Christian Szegedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szegedy:Christian", "Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0015:Wei", "Yangqing Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yangqing", "Pierre Sermanet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sermanet:Pierre", "Scott E.
