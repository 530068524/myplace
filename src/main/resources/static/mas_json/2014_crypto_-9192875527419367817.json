In our constructions, ciphertext overhead, private key size, and public key size are all poly-logarithmic in the total number of users. The systems are fully collusion-resistant against any number of colluders. All our systems are based on an O(logN)-way multilinear map to support a broadcast system for N users. We present three constructions based on different types of multilinear maps and providing different security guarantees. Our systems naturally give identity-based broadcast systems with short parameters.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of Texas at Austin", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Brent Waters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waters:Brent", "Mark Zhandry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhandry:Mark"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2014", "pages": 18}
