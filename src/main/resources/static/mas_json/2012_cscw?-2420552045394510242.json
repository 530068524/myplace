UCAVEs are portable immersive virtual environments that leverage mobile communication platforms, motion trackers and displays to facilitate ad-hoc virtual collaboration. We discuss design criteria and research challenges for UCAVEs, as well as a prototype hardware configuration that enables UCAVE interactions using modern smart phones and head mounted displays.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Georgia", "University of South Florida", "University of Georgia"], "authors": ["Aryabrata Basu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basu:Aryabrata", "Andrew Raij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raij:Andrew", "Kyle Johnsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnsen:Kyle"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
