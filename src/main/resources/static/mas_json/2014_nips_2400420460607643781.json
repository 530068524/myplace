{"title": "Multi-View Perceptron: a Deep Model for Learning Face Identity and View Representations.", "fields": ["viewpoints", "training set", "perceptron", "facial recognition system", "artificial neural network"], "abstract": "Various factors, such as identity, view, and illumination, are coupled in face images. Disentangling the identity and view representations is a major challenge in face recognition. Existing face recognition systems either use handcrafted features or learn features discriminatively to improve recognition accuracy. This is different from the behavior of primate brain. Recent studies [5, 19] discovered that primate brain has a face-processing network, where view and identity are processed by different neurons. Taking into account this instinct, this paper proposes a novel deep neural net, named multi-view perceptron (MVP), which can untangle the identity and view features, and in the meanwhile infer a full spectrum of multi-view images, given a single 2D face image. The identity features of MVP achieve superior performance on the MultiPIE dataset. MVP is also capable to interpolate and predict images under viewpoints that are unobserved in the training data.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zhenyao Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Zhenyao", "Ping Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0002:Ping", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "pages": 9}
