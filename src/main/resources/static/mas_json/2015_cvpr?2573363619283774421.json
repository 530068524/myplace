Traditional superpixel methods, that operate at the pixel level, cannot directly capture the geometric information disseminated into the images. We propose an alternative to these methods by operating at the level of geometric shapes. Our algorithm partitions images into convex polygons. It presents several interesting properties in terms of geometric guarantees, region compactness and scalability. The overall strategy consists in building a Voronoi diagram that conforms to preliminarily detected line-segments, before homogenizing the partition by spatial point process distributed over the image gradient. Our method is particularly adapted to images with strong geometric signatures, typically man-made objects and environments. We show the potential of our approach with experiments on large-scale images and comparisons with state-of-the-art superpixel methods.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Liuyun Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Liuyun", "Florent Lafarge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lafarge:Florent"], "pages": 9}
