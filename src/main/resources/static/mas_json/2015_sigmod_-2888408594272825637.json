As typified by emerging hardware such as UC Berkeley's Firebox project and by Intel's Rack-Scale Architecture (RSA), next generation servers will have  thousands of cores ,  large DRAM , and  huge NVRAM . We analyze the characteristics of these machines and find that no existing database is appropriate. Hence, we are developing  FOEDUS , an open-source, from-scratch database engine whose architecture is drastically different from traditional databases. It extends in-memory database technologies to further scale up and also allows transactions to efficiently manipulate data pages in both DRAM and NVRAM. We evaluate the performance of FOEDUS in a large NUMA machine (16 sockets and 240 physical cores) and find that FOEDUS achieves multiple orders of magnitude higher TPC-C throughput compared to H-Store with anti-caching.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Hideaki Kimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimura:Hideaki"], "pages": 16}
