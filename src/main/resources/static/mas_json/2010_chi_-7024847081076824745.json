{"title": "Finger-count & radial-stroke shortcuts: 2 techniques for augmenting linear menus on multi-touch surfaces.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "multi touch", "exploit", "menu bar", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "We propose Radial-Stroke and Finger-Count Shortcuts, two techniques aimed at augmenting the menubar on multi-touch surfaces. We designed these multi-finger two-handed interaction techniques in an attempt to overcome the limitations of direct pointing on interactive surfaces, while maintaining compatibility with traditional interaction techniques. While Radial-Stroke Shortcuts exploit the well-known advantages of Radial Strokes, Finger-Count Shortcuts exploit multi-touch by simply counting the number of fingers of each hand in contact with the surface. We report the results of an experimental evaluation of our technique, focusing on expert-mode performance. Finger-Count Shortcuts outperformed Radial-Stroke Shortcuts in terms of both easiness of learning and performance speed.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Gilles Bailly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailly:Gilles", "Eric Lecolinet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lecolinet:Eric", "Yves Guiard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guiard:Yves"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
