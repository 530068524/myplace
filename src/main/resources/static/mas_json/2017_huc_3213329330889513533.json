{"title": "Hybrid approach for reliable floor recognition method.", "fields": ["global positioning system", "embedded system", "computer science", "simulation"], "abstract": "Location-based services and context-aware services of smartphones have been paid much attentions. For these services, location information is important. Therefore, several positioning methods have been developed. This research focuses on unnecessary operation of GPS in seamless Indoor/Outdoor positioning. In order to reduce unnecessary behavior of GPS, we propose two floor recognition methods. First method is an advanced floor recognition method by using Wi-Fi and barometer in smartphones, when we know the location of Wi-Fi APs and the height between floors of buildings. Second method is to learn and infer if a floor of a building whose location of APs is unknown is connected to outside of the building. We conducted an evaluation of the proposed methods. As a result, the accuracy of the first method was 96%. The evaluation result also shows that the second method can learn and infer the floor which is connected to outside of the building.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University"], "authors": ["Taiga Nishiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishiyama:Taiga", "Masahiro Mochizuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mochizuki:Masahiro", "Kazuya Murao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murao:Kazuya", "Nobuhiko Nishio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishio:Nobuhiko"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
