{"title": "A novel family of geometric planar graphs for wireless ad hoc networks.", "fields": ["book embedding", "forbidden graph characterization", "pancyclic graph", "partial k tree", "polyhedral graph"], "abstract": "We propose a radically new family of geometric graphs, i.e., Hypocomb, Reduced Hypocomb and Local Hypocomb. The first two are extracted from a complete graph; the last is extracted from a Unit Disk Graph (UDG). We analytically study their properties including connectivity, planarity and degree bound. All these graphs are connected (provided the original graph is connected) planar. Hypocomb has unbounded degree while Reduced Hypocomb and Local Hypocomb have maximum degree 6 and 8, respectively. To our knowledge, Local Hypocomb is the first strictly-localized, degree-bounded planar graph computed using merely 1-hop neighbor position information. We present a construction algorithm for these graphs and analyze its time complexity. Hypocomb family graphs are promising for wireless ad hoc networking. We report our numerical results on their average degree and their impact on FACE routing [2]. We discuss their potential applications and some open problems.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["university of lille", "university of lille", "university of lille", "university of lille"], "authors": ["Xu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xu", "Nathalie Mitton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitton:Nathalie", "Isabelle Simplot-Ryl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simplot=Ryl:Isabelle", "David Simplot-Ryl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simplot=Ryl:David"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
