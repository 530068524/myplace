Constraints such as a-priori shape models or temporal models for dynamics are not required or used. Tracking facial features simply becomes the independent tracking of a set of points on the face. This allows us to cope with facial configurations not present in the training data. Tracking is achieved via linear predictors which provide a fast and effective method for mapping pixel-level information to tracked feature position displacements. To improve on this, a novel and robust biased linear predictor is proposed in this paper. Multiple linear predictors are grouped into a rigid flock to increase robustness. To further improve tracking accuracy, a novel probabilistic selection method is used to identify relevant visual areas for tracking a feature point. These selected flocks are then combined into a hierarchical multi-resolution LP model. Experimental results also show that this method performs more robustly and accurately than AAMs, without any a priori shape information and with minimal training examples.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of East Anglia", "University of East Anglia", "University of East Anglia", "University of Surrey"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Eng-Jon Ong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ong:Eng=Jon", "Yuxuan Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Yuxuan", "Barry-John Theobald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobald:Barry=John", "Richard W.
