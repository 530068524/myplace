The index is useful in a wide range of important applications (e.g., network analysis, routing planning, etc.). Our index is a tree-structured index constructed based on the concept of vertex cover. We propose an I/O-efficient algorithm to construct the index when the input graph is too large to fit in main memory. We give detailed analysis of I/O and CPU complexity for both index construction and query processing, and verify the efficiency of our index for query processing in massive real-world graphs.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Institute of Hi ... pore, Singapore"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James", "Yiping Ke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ke:Yiping", "Shumo Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Shumo", "Carter Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Carter"], "pages": 12}
