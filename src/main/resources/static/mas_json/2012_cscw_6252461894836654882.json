To better understand how users manage group context, we explored the practice of multiple profile management in social media. In doing so, we observed creative and opportunistic strategies for group context management. We found that multiple profile maintenance is motivated by four factors: privacy, identity, utility, and propriety. Drawing on these motives, we observe a continuum of boundary regulation behaviors: pseudonymity, practical obscurity, and transparent separation. Based on these findings, we encourage designers of group context management systems to more broadly consider motives and practices of group separations in social media. Group context management systems should be privacy-enhancing, but a singular focus on privacy overlooks a range of other group context management practices.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Samford University"], "authors": ["Frederic Stutzman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stutzman:Frederic", "Hartzog Woodrow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woodrow:Hartzog"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
