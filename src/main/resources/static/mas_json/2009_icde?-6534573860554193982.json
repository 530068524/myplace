The deductive programming approach is declarative, very expressive, and amenable to automatic optimizations. Such a framework allows users to program sensor network applications at a high-level without worrying about the low-level tedious details. %Our system translates a given deductive program to efficient distributed code that runs on individual nodes. To facilitate the above translation, we develop techniques for {\\em distributed and asynchronous} evaluation of deductive programs in sensor networks. Our techniques generalize to recursive programs without negations, arbitrary non-recursive programs with negations, and in general to arbitrary \"locally non-recursive'' programs with function symbols. %We present performance results on TOSSIM, a network simulator, and a small network testbed.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Himanshu Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Himanshu", "Xianjin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xianjin", "Xiang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Xiang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
