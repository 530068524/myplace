{"title": "Memory in Motion: The Influence of Gesture- and Touch-Based Input Modalities on Spatial Memory.", "fields": ["touchpad", "output device", "motion controller", "display size", "modalities"], "abstract": "People's ability to remember and recall spatial information can be harnessed to improve navigation and search performances in interactive systems. In this paper, we investigate how display size and input modality influence spatial memory, especially in relation to efficiency and user satisfaction. Based on an experiment with 28 participants, we analyze the effect of three input modalities (trackpad, direct touch, and gesture-based motion controller) and two display sizes (10.6\" and 55\") on people's ability to navigate to spatially spread items and recall their positions. Our findings show that the impact of input modality and display size on spatial memory is not straightforward, but characterized by trade-offs between spatial memory, efficiency, and user satisfaction.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Johannes Zagermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zagermann:Johannes", "Ulrike Pfeil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfeil:Ulrike", "Daniel Fink.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fink:Daniel", "Philipp von Bauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauer:Philipp_von", "Harald Reiterer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reiterer:Harald"], "pages": 12}
