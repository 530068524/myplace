However, naive implementations of parsing by intersection are very inefficient. We present techniques that speed up tree-automata-based parsing, to the point that it becomes practically feasible on realistic data when applied to context-free, TAG, and graph parsing. For graph parsing, we obtain the best runtimes in the literature.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "Department of Computing"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jonas Groschwitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Groschwitz:Jonas", "Alexander Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Alexander", "Mark Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Mark"], "pages": -1}
