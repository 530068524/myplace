{"title": "A microbenchmark to study GPU performance models.", "fields": ["scheduling", "graph partition", "algebraic number", "shared memory", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Basic microarchitectural features of NVIDIA GPUs have been stable for a decade, and many analytic solutions were proposed to model their performance. We present a way to review, systematize, and evaluate these approaches by using a microbenchmark. In this manner, we produce a brief algebraic summary of key elements of selected performance models, identify patterns in their design, and highlight their previously unknown limitations. Also, we identify a potentially superior method for estimating performance based on classical work.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Nvidia"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Vasily Volkov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Volkov:Vasily"], "pages": 2}
