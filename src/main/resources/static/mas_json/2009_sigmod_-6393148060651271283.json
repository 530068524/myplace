{"title": "Taming the storage dragon: the adventures of hoTMaN.", "fields": ["planned maintenance", "terabyte", "database server", "storage area network", "adventure"], "abstract": "HoTMaN (HoT-standby MaNager) is a joint project between MySpace and USC Database Laboratory to design and develop a tool to ensure a 24x7 up-time and ease administration of Terabytes of storage that sits underneath hundreds of database servers. The HoTMaN tool's innovation and uniqueness is that it can, with a few clicks, perform operational tasks that require hundreds of keyboard strokes by \"trusted trained\" experts. With HoTMaN, MySpace can within minutes migrate the relational database(s) of a failed server to a hot-standby. A process that could take over 1 hour and had a high potential for human error is now performed reliably. A database internal to HoTMaN captures all virtual disks, volume and file configurations associated with each SQL Server and candidate hot-standby servers where SQL server processing could be migrated. HoTMaN is deployed in production and its current operational benefits include: (i) enhanced availability of data, and (ii) planned maintenance and patching.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA", "USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA", "USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA", "MySpace, Beverl ...
