{"title": "Non-Parametric Approximate Linear Programming for MDPs.", "fields": ["regularization", "linear combination", "smoothness", "parametric statistics", "bellman equation"], "abstract": "The Approximate Linear Programming (ALP) approach to value function approximation for MDPs is a parametric value function approximation method, in that it represents the value function as a linear combination of features which are chosen a priori. Choosing these features can be a difficult challenge in itself. One recent effort, Regularized Approximate Linear Programming (RALP), uses L1 regularization to address this issue by combining a large initial set of features with a regularization penalty that favors a smooth value function with few non-zero weights. Rather than using smoothness as a backhanded way of addressing the feature selection problem, this paper starts with smoothness and develops a non-parametric approach to ALP that is consistent with the smoothness assumption. We show that this new approach has some favorable practical and analytical properties in comparison to (R)ALP.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Jason Pazis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pazis:Jason", "Ronald Parr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parr:Ronald"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
