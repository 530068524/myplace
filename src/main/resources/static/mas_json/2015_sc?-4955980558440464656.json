{"title": "Automatic sharing classification and timely push for cache-coherent systems.", "fields": ["directory", "data sharing", "cache", "benchmark", "latency"], "abstract": "This paper proposes and evaluates Sharing/Timing Adaptive Push (STAP), a dynamic scheme for preemptively sending data from producers to consumers to minimize critical-path communication latency. STAP uses small hardware buffers to dynamically detect sharing patterns and timing requirements. The scheme applies to both intra-node and inter-socket directory-based shared memory networks. We integrate STAP into a MOESI cache-coherence (prefetching-enabled) protocol using heuristics to detect different data sharing patterns, including broadcasts, producer/consumer, and migratory-data sharing. Using 15 benchmarks from the  PARSEC  and  SPLASH-2  suites we show that our scheme significantly reduces communication latency in NUMA systems and achieves an average of 9% performance improvement, with at most 3% on-chip storage overhead.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Malek Musleh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Musleh:Malek", "Vijay S.
