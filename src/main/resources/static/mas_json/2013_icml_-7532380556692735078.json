{"title": "Topic Model Diagnostics: Assessing Domain Relevance via Topical Alignment.", "fields": ["data mining", "inference", "topic model", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The use of topic models to analyze domain-specific texts often requires manual validation of the latent topics to ensure that they are meaningful. We introduce a framework to support such a large-scale assessment of topical relevance. We measure the correspondence between a set of latent topics and a set of reference concepts to quantify four types of topical misalignment: junk, fused, missing, and repeated topics. Our analysis compares 10,000 topic model variants to 200 expert-provided domain concepts, and demonstrates how our framework can inform choices of model parameters, inference algorithms, and intrinsic measures of topical quality.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Jason Chuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuang:Jason", "Sonal Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Sonal", "Christopher D.
