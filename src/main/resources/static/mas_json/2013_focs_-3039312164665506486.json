In the quantum k-SAT problem, each constraint is specified by a k-local projector and is satisfied by any state in its nullspace. Bravyi showed that quantum 2-SAT can be solved efficiently on a classical computer and that quantum k-SAT with k \u2265 4 is QMA 1 -complete [4]. Quantum 3-SAT was known to be contained in QMA 1  [4], but its computational hardness was unknown until now. We prove that quantum 3-SAT is QMA 1 -hard, and therefore complete for this complexity class.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Vienna"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["David Gosset.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gosset:David", "Daniel Nagaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagaj:Daniel"], "pages": 10}
