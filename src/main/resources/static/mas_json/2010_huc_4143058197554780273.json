In this note, we analyse cellular data collected as part of the Reality Mining project and use information-theoretic concepts to answer three questions (i) What time points in the day help predict a mobile phone user's activity at another time point? (ii) What time points in history are most useful to predict his future activities? and (iii) How difficult is it to predict his activity at a given time from another user's activity at another time?", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Driss Choujaa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choujaa:Driss", "Naranker Dulay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dulay:Naranker"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
