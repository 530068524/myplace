{"title": "DeshadowNet: A Multi-context Embedding Deep Network for Shadow Removal.", "fields": ["global network", "shadow", "benchmark", "annotation", "embedding"], "abstract": "Shadow removal is a challenging task as it requires the detection/annotation of shadows as well as semantic understanding of the scene. In this paper, we propose an automatic and end-to-end deep neural network (DeshadowNet) to tackle these problems in a unified manner. DeshadowNet is designed with a multi-context architecture, where the output shadow matte is predicted by embedding information from three different perspectives. The first global network extracts shadow features from a global view. Two levels of features are derived from the global network and transferred to two parallel networks. While one extracts the appearance of the input image, the other one involves semantic understanding for final prediction. These two complementary networks generate multi-context features to obtain the shadow matte with fine local details. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we construct the first large scale benchmark with 3088 image pairs. Extensive experiments on two publicly available benchmarks and our large-scale benchmark show that the proposed method performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "Shenyang Institute of Automation", "South China University of Technology", "Shenyang Institute of Automation", "City University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Liangqiong Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Liangqiong", "Jiandong Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Jiandong", "Shengfeng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Shengfeng", "Yandong Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Yandong", "Rynson W.
