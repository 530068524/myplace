In contrast to the widespread use of computers in cultural heritage and natural science museums, it is generally a challenge to introduce technology in art museums without disturbing the art works. This has usually been limited to individual audio guides. In our case we strive to achieve holistic and social experiences with seamless transitions between art experience and communication related to the artworks.   To reach a holistic experience with minimal disturbance of the artworks we apply three spatial multimedia techniques where the only interaction device needed is the human body. The three techniques are: 1) spatially bounded audio; 2) floor-based multimedia; 3) multimedia interior. The paper describes the application of these techniques for communication of information in a Mariko Mori exhibition. The multimedia installations and their implementation are described. It is argued that the utilization of the spatial multimedia techniques support holistic and social art experience. The multimedia installations were in function for a three and a half month exhibition period and they were approved on beforehand by the artist to be in concordance with the artworks.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University"], "authors": ["Karen Johanne Kortbek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kortbek:Karen_Johanne", "Kaj Gr\u00f8nb\u00e6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=oslash=nb=aelig=k:Kaj"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
