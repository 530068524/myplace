{"title": "Macroscopic Interferometry: Rethinking Depth Estimation with Frequency-Domain Time-of-Flight.", "fields": ["group delay and phase delay", "interference", "architecture", "time of flight", "interferometry"], "abstract": "A form of meter-scale, macroscopic interferometry is proposed using conventional time-of-flight (ToF) sensors. Today, ToF sensors use phase-based sampling, where the phase delay between emitted and received, high-frequency signals encodes distance. This paper examines an alternative ToF architecture, inspired by micron-scale, microscopic interferometry, that relies only on frequency sampling: we refer to our proposed macroscopic technique as Frequency-Domain Time of Flight (FD-ToF). The proposed architecture offers several benefits over existing phase ToF systems, such as robustness to phase wrapping and implicit resolution of multi-path interference, all while capturing the same number of subframes. A prototype camera is constructed to demonstrate macroscopic interferometry at meter scale.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Achuta Kadambi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kadambi:Achuta", "Jamie Schiel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiel:Jamie", "Ramesh Raskar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raskar:Ramesh"], "pages": 10}
