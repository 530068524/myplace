Here, using a large set of empirical measurement data taken in a rich variety of realistic driving environments, we attempt to characterize communication properties of DSRC as well as to analyze the causes of communication loss. Specifically, from a perspective of vehicular network engineers, the fundamental characteristic of DSRC communications is Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). We investigate the impact of both uncontrollable environmental factors and controllable radio parameters on DSRC characteristics. Moreover, we also examine temporal correlation, spatial correlation and symmetric correlation of DSRC characteristics under realistic vehicular environments.", "citation": "Citations (243)", "departments": ["General Motors", "North Carolina State University", "General Motors"], "authors": ["Fan Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Fan", "Daniel D.
