Studying the use of a mobile information technology in a local hospital ward at two months and eleven months after its deployment identifies both short- and long-term phenomena and reveals a mismatch between the intentions behind the deployed mobile technology and the nurses' current work practices. We contrast the new mobile technology with the paper artifacts that were previously relied upon in nursing work. Finally, in light of these findings, we suggest design directions for future technology to support the nursing shift work.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Charlotte Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Charlotte", "Sheelagh Carpendale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carpendale:Sheelagh"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
