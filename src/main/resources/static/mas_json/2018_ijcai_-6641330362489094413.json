First, we show that several examples from the AI literature can be modeled as succinct MDPs. Then we present computational approaches for upper and lower bounds for the SSP problem: (a)~for computing upper bounds, our method is polynomial-time in the implicit description of the MDP; (b)~for lower bounds, we present a polynomial-time (in the size of the implicit description) reduction to quadratic programming. Our approach is applicable even to infinite-state MDPs. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several classical examples from the AI literature.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Ferdowsi University of Mashhad"], "authors": ["Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Hongfei Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Hongfei", "Amir Kafshdar Goharshady.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goharshady:Amir_Kafshdar", "Nastaran Okati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okati:Nastaran"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
