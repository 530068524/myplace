In this paper, we explore the task of unambiguous text localization and retrieval, to accurately localize a specific targeted text instance in a cluttered image given a natural language description that refers to it. To address this issue, first a novel recurrent Dense Text Localization Network (DTLN) is proposed to sequentially decode the intermediate convolutional representations of a cluttered scene image into a set of distinct text instance detections. Our approach avoids repeated detections at multiple scales of the same text instance by recurrently memorizing previous detections, and effectively tackles crowded text instances in close proximity. Second, we propose a Context Reasoning Text Retrieval (CRTR) model, which jointly encodes text instances and their context information through a recurrent network, and ranks localized text bounding boxes by a scoring function of context compatibility. Quantitative evaluations on standard scene text localization benchmarks and a newly collected scene text retrieval dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our models for both scene text localization and retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["City College of New York", "Here", "City University of New York"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xuejian Rong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rong:Xuejian", "Chucai Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Chucai", "Yingli Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Yingli"], "pages": 9}
