We demonstrate probabilistic XML and data integration functionality of IMPrECISE. The prototype is configurable with domain knowledge such that the amount of uncertainty arising during data integration is reduced to an acceptable level, thus obtaining a \"good is good enough\" data integration with minimal human effort.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Twente", "University of Twente"], "authors": ["Ander de Keijzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keijzer:Ander_de", "Maurice van Keulen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keulen:Maurice_van"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
