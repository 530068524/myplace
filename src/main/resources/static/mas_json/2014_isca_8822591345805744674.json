{"title": "Eliminating redundant fragment shader executions on a mobile GPU via hardware memoization.", "fields": ["rendering", "fragment processing", "speedup", "memoization", "software rendering"], "abstract": "Redundancy is at the heart of graphical applications. In fact, generating an animation typically involves the succession of extremely similar images. In terms of rendering these images, this behavior translates into the creation of many fragment programs with the exact same input data. We have measured this fragment redundancy for a set of commercial Android applications, and found that more than 40% of the fragments used in a frame have been already computed in a prior frame.   In this paper we try to exploit this redundancy, using fragment memoization. Unfortunately, this is not an easy task as most of the redundancy exists across frames, rendering most HW based schemes unfeasible. We thus first take a step back and try to analyze the temporal locality of the redundant fragments, their complexity, and the number of inputs typically seen in fragment programs. The result of our analysis is a task level memoization scheme, that easily outperforms the current state-of-the-art in low power GPUs   More specifically, our experimental results show that our scheme is able to remove 59.7% of the redundant fragment computations on average. This materializes to a significant speedup of 17.6% on average, while also improving the overall energy efficiency by 8.9% on average.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Intel"], "authors": ["Jose-Maria Arnau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arnau:Jose=Maria", "Joan-Manuel Parcerisa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parcerisa:Joan=Manuel", "Polychronis Xekalakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xekalakis:Polychronis"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
