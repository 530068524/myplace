{"title": "Browserless Web Data Extraction: Challenges and Opportunities.", "fields": ["test case", "ajax", "deep web", "web server", "scraper site"], "abstract": "Most modern web scrapers use an embedded browser to render web pages and to simulate user actions. Such scrapers (or wrappers) are therefore expensive to execute, in terms of time and network traffic. In contrast, it is magnitudes more resource-efficient to use a \u201cbrowserless\u201d wrapper which directly accesses a web server through HTTP requests, and takes the desired data directly from the raw replies. However, creating and maintaining browserless wrappers of high precision requires specialists, and is prohibitively labor-intensive at scale. In this paper, we demonstrate the principle feasibility of automatically translating visual wrappers into \u201cbrowserless\u201d wrappers. We present the first algorithm and system performing such an automated translation on suitably restricted types of web sites. This system works in the vast majority of test cases and produces very fast and extremely resource-saving wrappers. We discuss research challenges for extending our approach to a general method applicable to a yet larger number of cases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Ruslan R.
