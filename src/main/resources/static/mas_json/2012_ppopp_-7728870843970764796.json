The hash trie supports standard mutable lock-free operations such as insertion, removal, lookup and their conditional variants. To ensure space-efficiency, removal operations compress the trie when necessary.   We show how to implement an efficient lock-free snapshot operation for concurrent hash tries. The snapshot operation uses a single-word compare-and-swap and avoids copying the data structure eagerly. Snapshots are used to implement consistent iterators and a linearizable size retrieval. We compare concurrent hash trie performance with other concurrent data structures and evaluate the performance of the snapshot operation.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Stanford University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Typesafe, Lausa ... ne, Switzerland"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Aleksandar Prokopec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prokopec:Aleksandar", "Nathan Grasso Bronson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bronson:Nathan_Grasso", "Phil Bagwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagwell:Phil", "Martin Odersky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Odersky:Martin"], "pages": 10}
