We establish a series of structural theorems about these proof systems, the main one stating that ${\\mathbb P}_c({\\mathbb F})$ proofs can be balanced: if a polynomial identity of syntactic degree $ d $ and depth $k$ has a ${\\mathbb P}_c({\\mathbb F})$ proof of size $s$, then it also has a ${\\mathbb P}_c({\\mathbb F})$ proof of size $ {\\rm poly}(s,d) $ in which every circuit has depth $ O(k+\\log^2 d + \\log d\\cdot \\log s) $. As a corollary, we obtain a quasi-polynomial simulation of ${\\mathbb P}_c({\\mathbb F})$ by ${\\mathbb P}_f({\\mathbb F})$. Using these results we obtain the following: consider the identities $\\det(XY) = \\det(X)\\cdot\\det(Y) \\mbox{ and } \\det(Z)= z_{11}\\cdots z_{nn},$ where $X,Y$, and $ Z$ are $n\\times n$ square matrices and $Z$ is a triangular matrix with $z_...", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Pavel Hrubes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hrubes:Pavel", "Iddo Tzameret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tzameret:Iddo"], "pages": 20}
