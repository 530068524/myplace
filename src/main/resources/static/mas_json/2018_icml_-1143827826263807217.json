{"title": "A Unified Framework for Structured Low-rank Matrix Learning.", "fields": ["hankel matrix", "low rank approximation", "feature learning", "factorization", "matrix completion"], "abstract": "We propose a novel optimization framework for learning a low-rank matrix which is also constrained to lie in a linear subspace. Exploiting the duality theory, we present a factorization that decouples the low-rank and structural constraints onto separate factors. The optimization problem is formulated on the Riemannian spectrahedron manifold, where the Riemannian framework allows to develop computationally efficient conjugate gradient and trust-region algorithms. Our approach easily accommodates popular non-smooth loss functions, e.g., L1-loss, and our algorithms are scalable to large-scale problem instances. The numerical comparisons show that our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art in standard, robust, and non-negative matrix completion, Hankel matrix learning, and multi-task feature learning problems on various benchmarks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Pratik Jawanpuria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jawanpuria:Pratik", "Bamdev Mishra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mishra:Bamdev"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
