Under this condition, reliably extracting facial features is very difficult. We propose a novel head pose estimation algorithm based on compressive sensing. Head image patches are mapped to a large feature space using the proposed extensive, yet efficient filter bank. The filter bank is designed to generate sparse responses of color and gradient information, which can be compressed using random projection, and classified by a random forest. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on head pose estimation in low-resolution images degraded by noise, occlusion, and blurring.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "University of California, Merced", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Donghoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Donghoon", "Ming-Hsuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Ming=Hsuan", "Songhwai Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Songhwai"], "pages": 9}
