We show that in this case the statistics of local neighborhoods around vertices of  G  is far from the statistics of local neighborhoods around vertices of any planar graph     G  \u2032    . In fact, a similar result is proved for any minor-closed property of bounded degree graphs.  The main motivation of the above result comes from theoretical computer-science. Using our main result we infer that for any minor-closed property    P   , there is a constant time algorithm for detecting if a graph is \u201cfar\u201d from satisfying    P   . This, in particular, answers an open problem of Goldreich and Ron [STOC 1997]  [20] , who asked if such an algorithm exists when    P    is the graph property of being planar. The proof combines results from the theory of graph minors with results on convergent sequences of sparse graphs, which rely on martingale arguments.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Itai Benjamini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benjamini:Itai", "Oded Schramm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schramm:Oded", "Asaf Shapira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shapira:Asaf"], "pages": 10}
