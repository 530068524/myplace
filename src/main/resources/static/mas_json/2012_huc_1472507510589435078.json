{"title": "Nesting the context for pervasive robotics.", "fields": ["educational robotics", "human robot interaction", "robotic paradigms", "cloud robotics", "outline of robotics"], "abstract": "Service robotics is becoming a leading application area of human-centered technologies, and the rise of household and personal assistance robots forecasts an utopist world of human--robot collaborative society. Along the road, one of the robotics community's major tasks is to work on the harmonization of trends, standardization of terms, interfaces and technologies. It is important to keep the scientific and social progress under control through sufficient public outreach and technology dissemination. Along those lines, the  IEEE Robotics & Automation Society  is sponsoring a working group entitled  Ontologies for Robotics and Automation  that will bridge cutting edge technology to users of the services---the general public. In this paper, the background of the project is presented, the definitions and examples of descriptive systems of relations are described, showing how ontologies can help to address the above challenges.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Federal University of Bahia", "Polytechnic Institute of Castelo Branco", "American University in Cairo", "Monash University"], "authors": ["Tam\u00e1s Haidegger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haidegger:Tam=aacute=s", "Marcos E.
