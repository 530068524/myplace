{"title": "Solving Linear Systems through Nested Dissection.", "fields": ["symmetric matrix", "gaussian elimination", "nested dissection", "sparse matrix", "positive definite matrix"], "abstract": "The generalized nested dissection method, developed by Lipton, Rose, and Tarjan, is a seminal method for solving a linear system Ax=b where A is a symmetric positive definite matrix. The method runs extremely fast whenever A is a well-separable matrix (such as matrices whose underlying support is planar or avoids a fixed minor). In this work we extend the nested dissection method to apply to any non-singular well-separable matrix over any field. The running times we obtain essentially match those of the nested dissection method.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "University of Haifa"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Noga Alon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alon:Noga", "Raphael Yuster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuster:Raphael"], "pages": 10}
