Existing techniques to recover from one or a series of failures do not offer performance predictability and may cause serious congestion. In this paper, we propose Resilient Routing Reconfiguration (R3), a novel routing protection scheme that is (i) provably congestion-free under a large number of failure scenarios; (ii) efficient by having low router processing overhead and memory requirements; (iii) flexible in accommodating different performance requirements (e.g., handling realistic failure scenarios, prioritized traffic, and the trade-off between performance and resilience); and (iv) robust to both topology failures and traffic variations. We implement R3 on Linux using a simple extension of MPLS, called MPLS-ff. We then conduct extensive Emulab experiments and simulations using realistic network topologies and traffic demands. Our results show that R3 achieves near-optimal performance and is at least 50% better than the existing schemes under a wide range of failure scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Yale University", "Google", "University of Texas at Austin", "Yale University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Ye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ye", "Hao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0010:Hao", "Ajay Mahimkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahimkar:Ajay", "Richard Alimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alimi:Richard", "Yin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Yin", "Lili Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Lili", "Yang Richard Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yang_Richard"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
