These principles include (1) maintaining coordination among views, (2) having a continuous depth chart, (3) placing rest areas between strong 3D shots, (4) using a shallow depth of field for shots with excessive depth brackets, and (5) being careful about the stereoscopic window. Taking these principles into account, we propose designs for stereoscopic extensions of two popular 2D media applications---video stabilization and photo slideshow---to provide a better 3D viewing experience. User studies show that by incorporating 3D cinematography principles, the proposed methods yield more comfortable and enjoyable 3D viewing experiences than those delivered using naive extensions of conventional 2D methods.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "Lytro"], "authors": ["Chun-Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chun=Wei", "Tz-Huan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Tz=Huan", "Ming-Hsu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Ming=Hsu", "Ken-Yi Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Ken=Yi", "Chia-Kai Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Chia=Kai", "Yung-Yu Chuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuang:Yung=Yu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
