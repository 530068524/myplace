We draw particular attention to a specific feature of an interface design, which we have observed over an extensive number of uses, as facilitating an under-reported but none-the-less intriguing aspect of the photo-sharing experience - namely the process of 'getting sidetracked'. Through a series of vignettes of interaction during photo-sharing sessions we demonstrate how users of our tabletop photoware system used peripheral presentation of topically incoherent photos to artfully initiate new photo-talk sequences in on-going discourse. From this we draw implications for the design of tabletop photo applications, and for the experiential analysis of such devices.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Otmar Hilliges.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hilliges:Otmar", "David Shelby Kirk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirk:David_Shelby"], "pages": 4}
