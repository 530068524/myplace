Our approach is more democratic: we do not commit to a single LPM. Instead, we approximate the target using the votes of a  collection  of consistent LPMs. We present two variations of this method--- variable voting  and  model voting ---and empirically show that these democratic algorithms outperform the existing methods. We also introduce an intuitive yet powerful learning bias to prune some of the possible LPMs. We demonstrate how this learning bias can be used with variable and model voting and show that the learning bias improves the learning curve significantly, especially when the number of observations is small.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "BBN Technologies", "University of Arizona", "Rutgers University", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Fusun Yaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yaman:Fusun", "Thomas J.
