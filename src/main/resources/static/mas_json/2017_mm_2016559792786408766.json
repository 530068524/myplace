{"title": "Towards Micro-video Understanding by Joint Sequential-Sparse Modeling.", "fields": ["deep learning", "machine learning", "categorization", "convolutional neural network", "modalities"], "abstract": "Like the traditional long videos, micro-videos are the unity of textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. These modalities sequentially tell a real-life event from distinct angles. Yet, unlike the traditional long videos with rich content, micro-videos are very short, lasting for 6-15 seconds, and they hence usually convey one or a few high-level concepts. In the light of this, we have to characterize and jointly model the sparseness and multiple sequential structures for better micro-video understanding. To accomplish this, in this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning model, which packs three parallel LSTMs to capture the sequential structures and a convolutional neural network to learn the sparse concept-level representations of micro-videos. We applied our model to the application of micro-video categorization. Besides, we constructed a real-world dataset for sequence modeling and released it to facilitate other researchers. Experimental results demonstrate that our model yields better performance than several state-of-the-art baselines.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Hefei University of Technology", "Shandong University"], "authors": ["Meng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Meng", "Liqiang Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Liqiang", "Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Meng", "Baoquan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Baoquan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
