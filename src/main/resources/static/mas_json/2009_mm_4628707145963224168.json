Our algorithm consists of two stages: motion field completion and color completion via global optimization. First, local motions within the missing parts are completed patch-by-patch greedily using pre-computed available motions in the video. Then the missing regions are filled by sampling patches from available parts of the video. We formulate the video completion as a global energy minimization problem by Markov random fields (MRFs). Based on the completed motion field of the video, a well-defined energy function involving both spatial and temporal coherence relationship is constructed. A coarse-to-fine Belief Propagation (BP) is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Experimental results have demonstrated the good performance of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Ming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ming", "Shifeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shifeng", "Jianzhuang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jianzhuang", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
