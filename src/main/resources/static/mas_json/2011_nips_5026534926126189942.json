These approximations are typically used over graphs with short-range cycles. We demonstrate that these approximations also help in sparse graphs with long-range loops, as the ones used in coding theory to approach channel capacity. For asymptotically large sparse graph, the expectation propagation algorithm together with the tree structure yields a completely disconnected approximation to the graphical model but, for for finite-length practical sparse graphs, the tree structure approximation to the code graph provides accurate estimates for the marginal of each variable. Furthermore, we propose a new method for constructing the tree structure on the fly that might be more amenable for sparse graphs with general factors.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Seville", "University of Seville", "University of Seville", "Complutense University of Madrid"], "authors": ["Pablo M.
