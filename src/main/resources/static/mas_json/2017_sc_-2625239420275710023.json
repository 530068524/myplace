{"title": "An efficient MPI/openMP parallelization of the Hartree-Fock method for the second generation of Intel", "fields": ["memory footprint", "legacy code", "thread", "gamess", "xeon phi"], "abstract": "Modern OpenMP threading techniques are used to convert the MPI-only Hartree-Fock code in the GAMESS program to a hybrid MPI/OpenMP algorithm. Two separate implementations that differ by the sharing or replication of key data structures among threads are considered, density and Fock matrices. All implementations are benchmarked on a super-computer of 3,000 Intel\u00ae Xeon Phi \u2122  processors. With 64 cores per processor, scaling numbers are reported on up to 192,000 cores. The hybrid MPI/OpenMP implementation reduces the memory footprint by approximately 200 times compared to the legacy code. The MPI/OpenMP code was shown to run up to six times faster than the original for a range of molecular system sizes.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Moscow State University", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Iowa State University", "Intel", "RSC Technologie ... sian Federation"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Vladimir Mironov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mironov:Vladimir", "Yuri Alexeev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexeev:Yuri", "Kristopher Keipert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keipert:Kristopher", "Michael D'mello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=mello:Michael", "Alexander Moskovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moskovsky:Alexander", "Mark S.
