This approach enables us to selectively utilize the contextual relationships suitable for an input query image. We introduce a context link view of contextual knowledge, where the relationship between a pair of annotated regions is represented as a context link on a similarity graph of regions. Link analysis techniques are used to estimate the pairwise context scores of all pairs of unlabeled regions in the input image. Our system integrates the learned context scores into a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework in the form of pairwise cost and infers the semantic segmentation result by MRF optimization. Experimental results on object class segmentation show that the proposed graph-based context model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Heesoo Myeong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Myeong:Heesoo", "Ju Yong Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Ju_Yong", "Kyoung Mu Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyoung_Mu"], "pages": 8}
