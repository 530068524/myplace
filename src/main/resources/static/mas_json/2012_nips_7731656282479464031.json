{"title": "Dynamical And-Or Graph Learning for Object Shape Modeling and Detection.", "fields": ["graph", "initialization", "discriminative model", "encoding"], "abstract": "This paper studies a novel discriminative part-based model to represent and recognize object shapes with an \"And-Or graph\". We define this model consisting of three layers: the leaf-nodes with collaborative edges for localizing local parts, the or-nodes specifying the switch of leaf-nodes, and the root-node encoding the global verification. A discriminative learning algorithm, extended from the CCCP [23], is proposed to train the model in a dynamical manner: the model structure (e.g., the configuration of the leaf-nodes associated with the or-nodes) is automatically determined with optimizing the multi-layer parameters during the iteration. The advantages of our method are two-fold. (i) The And-Or graph model enables us to handle well large intra-class variance and background clutters for object shape detection from images. (ii) The proposed learning algorithm is able to obtain the And-Or graph representation without requiring elaborate supervision and initialization. We validate the proposed method on several challenging databases (e.g., INRIA-Horse, ETHZ-Shape, and UIUC-People), and it outperforms the state-of-the-arts approaches.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Xiaolong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0004:Xiaolong", "Liang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Liang"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
