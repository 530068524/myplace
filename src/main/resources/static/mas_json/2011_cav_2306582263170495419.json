To determine candidate code fragments, our approach takes into account polymorphic type constraints as well as test cases. Our tool interactively displays a ranked list of suggested code fragments that are appropriate for the current program point. We have found our system to be useful for synthesizing code fragments for common programming tasks, and we believe it is a good platform for exploring software synthesis techniques.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Tihomir Gvero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gvero:Tihomir", "Viktor Kuncak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuncak:Viktor", "Ruzica Piskac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piskac:Ruzica"], "pages": 6}
