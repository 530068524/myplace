{"title": "Local Loss Optimization in Operator Models: A New Insight into Spectral Learning.", "fields": ["operator", "regular polygon", "regularization", "latent variable", "observable"], "abstract": "This paper re-visits the spectral method for learning latent variable models defined in terms of observable operators. We give a new perspective on the method, showing that operators can be recovered by minimizing a loss defined on a finite subset of the domain. This leads to a derivation of a non-convex optimization similar to the spectral method. We also propose a regularized convex relaxation of this optimization. In practice our experiments show that a continuous regularization parameter (in contrast with the discrete number of states in the original method) allows a better trade-off between accuracy and model complexity. We also prove that in general, a randomized strategy for choosing the local loss succeeds with high probability.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia"], "authors": ["Borja Balle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balle:Borja", "Ariadna Quattoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quattoni:Ariadna", "Xavier Carreras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carreras:Xavier"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
