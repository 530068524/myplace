Specifically, we present m-A*, extending the well-known A* to the m-best task, and prove that all its desirable properties, including soundness, completeness and optimal efficiency, are maintained. Since Best-First algorithms have memory problems, we also extend the memory-efficient Depth-First Branch-and-Bound to the m-best task. We extend both algorithms to optimization tasks over graphical models (e.g., Weighted CSP and MPE in Bayesian networks), provide complexity analysis and an empirical evaluation. Our experiments with 5 variants of Best-First and Branch-and-Bound confirm that Best-First is largely superior when memory is available, but Branch-and-Bound is more robust, while both styles of search benefit greatly when the heuristic evaluation function has increased accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "IBM"], "authors": ["Rina Dechter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dechter:Rina", "Natalia Flerova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flerova:Natalia", "Radu Marinescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinescu_0002:Radu"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
