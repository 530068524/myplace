Our notion of randomly generated is with respect to a uniform distribution.   To prove this we extend the concept of  well behaved  c log(n)-Monotone DNF formulae to c log(n)-DNF formulae, and show that almost every DNF formula is well-behaved, and that there exists a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm that exactly learns all well behaved c log(n)-DNF formula. This is the first algorithm that properly learns (non-monotone) DNF with a polynomial number of terms from random examples alone.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Linda Sellie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sellie:Linda"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
