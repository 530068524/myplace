However, implementing collaborative real-time applications like Google Docs requires specific concurrency control services (i.e. document synchronization and conflict resolution) that are not included in prevalent general-purpose frameworks like jQuery or Knockout. Hence, developers have to get familiar with specific collaboration frameworks (e.g. ShareJS) which substantially increases the development effort. To ease the development of collaborative web applications, we propose a set of source code annotations representing a lightweight mechanism to introduce concurrency control services into mature web frameworks. Those annotations are interpreted at runtime by a dedicated collaboration engine to sync documents and resolve conflicts. We enhanced the general-purpose framework Knockout with a collaboration engine and conducted a developer study comparing our approach to a traditional concurrency control library. The evaluation results show that the effort to incorporate collaboration capabilities into a web application can be reduced by up to 40 percent using the annotation-based solution.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Chemnitz University of Technology", "SAP AG, Dresden, Germany", "SAP AG, Dresden, Germany"], "authors": ["Matthias Heinrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinrich:Matthias", "Franz Josef Gr\u00fcneberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=uuml=neberger:Franz_Josef", "Thomas Springer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Springer:Thomas", "Martin Gaedke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaedke:Martin"], "conf": "www", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
