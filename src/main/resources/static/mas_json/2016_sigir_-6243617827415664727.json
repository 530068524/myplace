{"title": "Query to Knowledge: Unsupervised Entity Extraction from Shopping Queries using Adaptor Grammars.", "fields": ["chunking", "web query classification", "named entity recognition", "web search query", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "Web search queries provide a surprisingly large amount of information, which can be potentially organized and converted into a knowledgebase. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatically identifying brand and product entities from a large collection of web queries in online shopping domain. We propose an unsupervised approach based on adaptor grammars that does not require any human annotation efforts nor rely on any external resources. To reduce the noise and normalize the query patterns, we introduce a query standardization step, which groups multiple search patterns and word orderings together into their most frequent ones. We present three different sets of grammar rules used to infer query structures and extract brand and product entities. To give an objective assessment of the performance of our approach, we conduct experiments on a large collection of online shopping queries and intrinsically evaluate the knowledgebase generated by our method qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, we also evaluate our framework on extrinsic tasks on query tagging and chunking. Our empirical studies show that the knowledgebase discovered by our approach is highly accurate, has good coverage and significantly improves the performance on the external tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Ke Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai_0001:Ke", "Zornitsa Kozareva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozareva:Zornitsa", "Yuening Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yuening", "Qi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qi", "Weiwei Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Weiwei"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
