On the one hand, each neuron-like computational element must consume minimal power and area to enable scaling up to biological scales of billions of neurons; this rules out direct support for complex and expensive features like floating point and transcendental functions. On the other hand, to fully benefit from cortical properties and operations, neuromorphic architectures must support complex non-linear neuronal behaviors. This semantic gap between the simple and power-efficient processing elements and complex neuronal behaviors has rekindled a RISC vs. CISC-like debate within the neuromorphic hardware design community. In this paper, we address the aforementioned semantic gap for a recently-described digital neuromorphic architecture that constitutes simple Linear-Leak Integrate-and-Fire (LLIF) spiking neurons as processing primitives. We show that despite the simplicity of LLIF primitives, a broad class of complex neuronal behaviors can be emulated by composing assemblies of such primitives with low area and power overheads. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for the LLIF primitives without built-in mechanisms for synaptic plasticity, two well-known neural learning rules-spike timing dependent plasticity and Hebbian learning-can be emulated via assemblies of LLIF primitives. By bridging the semantic gap for one such system we enable neuromorphic system developers, in general, to keep their hardware design simple and power-efficient and at the same time enjoy the benefits of complex neuronal behaviors essential for robust and accurate cortical simulation.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Andrew Nere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nere:Andrew", "Atif Hashmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashmi:Atif", "Mikko H.
