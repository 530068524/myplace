Asymptotic, respectively, approximate performance measures are known from large deviations theory for single queuing systems with fBm traffic. In this paper we prove a rigorous sample path envelope for fBm that complements previous results. We find that both approaches agree in their outcome that overflow probabilities for fBm traffic have a Weibull tail. We show numerical results on the impact of the variability and the correlation of fBm traffic on the queuing performance.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Leibniz University of Hanover", "Leibniz University of Hanover"], "authors": ["Amr Rizk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rizk:Amr", "Markus Fidler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fidler:Markus"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
