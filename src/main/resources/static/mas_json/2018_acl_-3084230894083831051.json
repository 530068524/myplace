It tends to ignore past alignment information, however, which often leads to over-translation and under-translation. To address this problem, we propose coverage-based NMT in this paper. We maintain a coverage vector to keep track of the attention history. The coverage vector is fed to the attention model to help adjust future attention, which lets NMT system to consider more about untranslated source words. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly improves both translation quality and alignment quality over standard attention-based NMT. 1", "citation": "Citations (144)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["George Foster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foster:George", "Ashish Vaswani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaswani:Ashish", "Jakob Uszkoreit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uszkoreit:Jakob", "Wolfgang Macherey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Macherey:Wolfgang", "Lukasz Kaiser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaiser:Lukasz", "Orhan Firat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Firat:Orhan", "Llion Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones:Llion", "Noam Shazeer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shazeer:Noam", "Yonghui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yonghui", "Ankur Bapna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bapna:Ankur", "Melvin Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Melvin", "Mike Schuster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuster:Mike", "Zhifeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhifeng", "Macduff Hughes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hughes:Macduff", "Niki Parmar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parmar:Niki", "Mia Xu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Mia_Xu"], "pages": 11}
