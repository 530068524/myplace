{"title": "Bypassing KLS: Gaussian Cooling and an O^*(n3) Volume Algorithm.", "fields": ["convex body", "open problem", "hyperplane", "gaussian", "convex geometry"], "abstract": "We present an O*(n 3 ) randomized algorithm for estimating the volume of a well-rounded convex body given by a membership oracle, improving on the previous best complexity of O*(n 4 ). The new algorithmic ingredient is an accelerated cooling schedule where the rate of cooling increases with the temperature. Previously, the known approach for potentially achieving such complexity relied on a positive resolution of the KLS hyperplane conjecture, a central open problem in convex geometry.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Benjamin Cousins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cousins:Benjamin", "Santosh Vempala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vempala:Santosh"], "pages": 10}
