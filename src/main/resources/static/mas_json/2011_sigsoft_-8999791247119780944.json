Our approach supports software engineers to analyze and develop context-aware adaptive applications. The software lifecycle process we propose supports static and dynamic decision making mechanisms, run-time consistent evolution and it is amenable to be automated.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["IMT Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca"], "authors": ["Marco Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Marco"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
