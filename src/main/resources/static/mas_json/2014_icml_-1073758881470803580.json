This class of problems was recently also studied by Ouyang et al. (2013) and Suzuki (2013); both introduced similar stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (SADMM) algorithms. However, the analysis of both papers led to suboptimal convergence rates. This paper presents two new SADMM methods: (i) the first attains the minimax optimal rate of O(1/k) for nonsmooth strongly-convex stochastic problems; while (ii) the second progresses towards an optimalrate by exhibiting an O(1/k2) rate for the smooth part. We present several experiments with our new methods; the results indicate improved performance over competing ADMM methods.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Shiraz University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Samaneh Azadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azadi:Samaneh", "Suvrit Sra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sra:Suvrit"], "pages": 9}
