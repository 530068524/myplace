IUCA allows efficient interaction in a full-resolution perspective view by integrating transients animated transitions to orthographic views into the manipulation task. This provides an interaction in context, with precise object positioning and alignment. An evaluation of the technique shows that, compared to the classical configurations, IUCA allows to reduce pointing time by 14% on average. Testing with professional 3D designers and novice users indicate that IUCA is easy to use and to learn; and that users feel comfortable with it.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Michael Ortega.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ortega:Michael"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
