In this paper we address the problem of finding the complete set of correlated equilibria for general-sum stochastic games with perfect information. We present QPACE \u2013 an algorithm orders of magnitude more efficient than previous approaches while maintaining a guarantee of convergence and bounded error. Finally, we validate our claims and demonstrate the limits of our algorithm with extensive empirical tests.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Liam MacDermed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/MacDermed:Liam", "Karthik Sankaran Narayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayan:Karthik_Sankaran", "Charles Lee Isbell Jr......http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isbell_Jr=:Charles_Lee", "Lora Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:Lora"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
