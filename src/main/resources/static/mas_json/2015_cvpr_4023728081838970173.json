Unlike the conventional cascaded regression approaches that start with an initial shape and refine the shape in a cascaded manner, our approach begins with a coarse search over a shape space that contains diverse shapes, and employs the coarse solution to constrain subsequent finer search of shapes. The unique stage-by-stage progressive and adaptive search i) prevents the final solution from being trapped in local optima due to poor initialisation, a common problem encountered by cascaded regression approaches; and ii) improves the robustness in coping with large pose variations. The framework demonstrates real-time performance and state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks including the challenging 300-W dataset.", "citation": "Citations (226)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "SenseTime Group, China"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shizhan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Shizhan", "Cheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0002:Cheng", "Chen Change Loy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loy:Chen_Change", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "pages": 9}
