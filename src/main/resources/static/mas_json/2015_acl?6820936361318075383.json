Recent word-embedding models based on distributional semantics hypothesis are known to be weak for modeling lexical contrast. We present in this paper the embedding models that achieve an F-score of 92% on the widely-used, publicly available dataset, the GRE \u201cmost contrasting word\u201d questions (Mohammad et al., 2008). This is the highest performance seen so far on this dataset. Surprisingly at the first glance, unlike what was suggested in most previous work, where relatedness statistics learned from corpora is claimed to yield extra gains over lexicon-based models, we obtained our best result relying solely on lexical resources (Roget\u2019s and WordNet)\u2014corpora statistics did not lead to further improvement. However, this should not be simply taken as that distributional statistics is not useful. We examine several basic concerns in modeling contrasting meaning to provide detailed analysis, with the aim to shed some light on the future directions for this basic semantics modeling problem.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhigang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhigang", "Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Wei", "Qian Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qian", "Xiaoping Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiaoping", "Si Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Si", "Hui Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0001:Hui", "Xiaodan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaodan"], "pages": 10}
