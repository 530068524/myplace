We propose to relax such a simplistic approach and include multi-hop opportunities by annexing a node's vicinity to its network vision. We investigate how the vicinity of a node evolves through time and whether such knowledge is useful when routing data. By analyzing a modified version of the pure WAIT forwarding strategy, we observe a clear tradeoff between routing performance and cost for monitoring the neighborhood. By observing a vicinity-aware WAIT strategy, we emphasize how the pure WAIT misses interesting end-to-end transmission opportunities through nearby nodes. For the datasets we consider, our analyses also suggest that limiting a node's neighborhood view to four hops is enough to improve forwarding efficiency while keeping control overhead low.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "Thales Communications"], "authors": ["Tiphaine Phe-Neau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phe=Neau:Tiphaine", "Marcelo Dias de Amorim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amorim:Marcelo_Dias_de", "Vania Conan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conan:Vania"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
