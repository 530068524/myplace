{"title": "Fast learning rates with heavy-tailed losses.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "bounded function", "discrete mathematics", "envelope", "vector quantization"], "abstract": "We study fast learning rates when the losses are not necessarily bounded and may have a distribution with heavy tails. To enable such analyses, we introduce two new conditions: (i) the envelope function $\\sup_{f \\in \\mathcal{F}}|\\ell \\circ f|$, where $\\ell$ is the loss function and $\\mathcal{F}$ is the hypothesis class, exists and is $L^r$-integrable, and (ii) $\\ell$ satisfies the multi-scale Bernstein's condition on $\\mathcal{F}$. Under these assumptions, we prove that learning rate faster than $O(n^{-1/2})$ can be obtained and, depending on $r$ and the multi-scale Bernstein's powers, can be arbitrarily close to $O(n^{-1})$. We then verify these assumptions and derive fast learning rates for the problem of vector quantization by $k$-means clustering with heavy-tailed distributions. The analyses enable us to obtain novel learning rates that extend and complement existing results in the literature from both theoretical and practical viewpoints.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Vu C.
