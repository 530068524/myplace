Ferry's type system and operations match those of scripting or programming languages; its compiler has been designed to emit (bundles of) compliant and efficient SQL:1999 statements. Ferry acts as glue that permits a programming style in which developers access database tables using their programming language's own syntax and idioms -- the Ferry-expressible fragments of such programs may be executed by a relational database back-end,  i.e. , close to the data. The demonstrator F erry D eck  implements  compile-and-execute-as-you-type  interactivity for F erry  and offers a variety of (graphical) hooks to explore and inspect this approach to database-supported program execution.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of T\u00fcbingen"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Torsten Grust.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grust:Torsten", "Manuel Mayr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayr:Manuel", "Jan Rittinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rittinger:Jan", "Tom Schreiber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schreiber:Tom"], "pages": 4}
