Its success is much due to the associated bisimulation proof method, which can be further enhanced by means of \u201cbisimulation up-to\u201d techniques such as \u201cup-to context.\u201d   A different proof method is discussed, based on a unique solution of special forms of inequations called contractions and inspired by Milner\u2019s theorem on unique solution of equations. The method is as powerful as the bisimulation proof method and its \u201cup-to context\u201d enhancements. The definition of contraction can be transferred onto other behavioural equivalences, possibly contextual and non-coinductive. This enables a coinductive reasoning style on such equivalences, either by applying the method based on unique solution of contractions or by injecting appropriate contraction preorders into the bisimulation game.   The techniques are illustrated in CCS-like languages; an example dealing with higher-order languages is also shown.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Davide Sangiorgi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sangiorgi:Davide"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
