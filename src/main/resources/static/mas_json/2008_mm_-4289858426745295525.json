The network is, at best, used for streaming data transmission. Since there is a strong trend towards networked systems, these traditional approaches are becoming obsolete. In contrast, the Network-Integrated Multimedia Middleware (NMM) offers a multimedia architecture, which considers the network as an integral part and enables the intelligent use of devices distributed across the network.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Motama GmbH, Sa ... r\u00fccken, Germany", "Motama GmbH, Sa ... r\u00fccken, Germany"], "authors": ["Marco Lohse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lohse:Marco", "Florian Winter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winter:Florian", "Michael Repplinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Repplinger:Michael", "Philipp Slusallek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slusallek:Philipp"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
