Among various algorithms proposed for similarity search in high-dimensional space, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is the most popular one, which recently has been extended to Kernelized Locality-Sensitive Hashing (KLSH) by exploiting kernel similarity for better retrieval efficacy. Typically, KLSH works only with a single kernel, which is often limited in real-world multimedia applications, where data may originate from multiple resources or can be represented in several different forms. For example, in content-based multimedia retrieval, a variety of features can be extracted to represent contents of an image. To overcome the limitation of regular KLSH, we propose a novel Boosting Multi-Kernel Locality-Sensitive Hashing (BMKLSH) scheme that significantly boosts the retrieval performance of KLSH by making use of multiple kernels. We conduct extensive experiments for large-scale content-based image retrieval, in which encouraging results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Michigan State University"], "authors": ["Hao Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Hao", "Pengcheng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Pengcheng", "Steven C.
