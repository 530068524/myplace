{"title": "Optimal Bounds on Approximation of Submodular and XOS Functions by Juntas.", "fields": ["subadditivity", "function approximation", "submodular set function", "linear function", "exponential function", "multiplicative function", "small number"], "abstract": "We investigate the approximability of several classes of real-valued functions by functions of a small number of variables (juntas). Our main results are tight bounds on the number of variables required to approximate a function f:{0, 1} n  \u2192 [0,1] within l 2 -error \u03f5 over the uniform distribution: If f is sub modular, then it is \u03f5-close to a function of O(1/\u03f5 2  log 1/\u03f5) variables. This is an exponential improvement over previously known results FeldmanKV:13. We note that \u03a9(1/\u03f5 2 ) variables are necessary even for linear functions. If f is fractionally sub additive (XOS) it is e-close to a function of 2 O(1/\u03f52)  variables. This result holds for all functions with low total l 1 -influence and is a real-valued analogue of Fried gut's theorem for boolean functions. We show that 2 \u03a9(1/\u03f5)  variables are necessary even for XOS functions. As applications of these results, we provide learning algorithms over the uniform distribution. For XOS functions, we give a PAC learning algorithm that runs in time 2 1/poly(\u03f5)  poly(n). For sub modular functions we give an algorithm in the more demanding PMAC learning model BalcanHarvey:[12] which requires a multiplicative (1 + \u03b3) factor approximation with probability at least 1 - \u03f5 over the target distribution. Our uniform distribution algorithm runs in time 2 1/poly(\u03b3\u03f5)  poly(n). This is the first algorithm in the PMAC model that can achieve a constant approximation factor arbitrarily close to 1 for all sub modular functions (even over the uniform distribution). It relies crucially on our approximation by junta result. As follows from the lower bounds in FeldmanKV:13 both of these algorithms are close to optimal. We also give applications for proper learning, testing and agnostic learning with value queries of these classes.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Vitaly Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Vitaly", "Jan Vondr\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vondr=aacute=k:Jan"], "pages": 10}
