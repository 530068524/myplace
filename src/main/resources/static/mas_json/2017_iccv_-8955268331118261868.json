However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G : X \u2192 Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F : Y \u2192 X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push F(G(X)) \u2248 X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jun-Yan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jun=Yan", "Taesung Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Taesung", "Phillip Isola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isola:Phillip", "Alexei A.
