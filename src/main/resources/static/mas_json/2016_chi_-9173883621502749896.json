{"title": "KeDiary: Using Mobile Phones to Assist Patients in Recovering from Drug Addiction.", "fields": ["ketamine", "physical therapy", "addiction", "drug", "club drug"], "abstract": "Ketamine is an addictive drug that has been shown to inflict considerable physical and mental damage on users. Due in part to its low cost, ketamine has become one of the most popular club drugs among young adults and teenagers in Southeast Asia. This paper proposes a phone-based support system (KeDiary) with Bluetooth-enabled device for the screening of saliva, as a means of assisting ketamine-dependent patients to self-monitor their ketamine use following acute withdrawal treatment. We also conducted a practical experiment to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system, wherein three ketamine-dependent patients self-administered tests at least once per day over a period of three weeks. Follow-up interviews with the same users helped in the further refinement of the proposed self-monitoring system.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "Taipei City Hos ... pei, Taiwan Roc"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chuang-Wen You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Chuang=Wen", "Ya-Fang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Ya=Fang", "Cheng-Yuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Cheng=Yuan", "Yu-Lun Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Yu=Lun", "Ming-Chyi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ming=Chyi", "Chao-Hui Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chao=Hui", "Hao-Chuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hao=Chuan", "Hao-Hua Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Hao=Hua"], "pages": 6}
