This \"LightCloth\" is woven from diffusive optical fibers. Since the fibers are arranged in parallel, the cloth has one-dimensional position information. Sensor-emitter pairs attached to bundles of contiguous fibers enable bundle-specific light input and output. We developed a prototype system that allows full-color illumination and 8-bit data input by infrared signals. We present as an application a chair with a LightCloth cover whose illumination pattern is specified using an infrared light pen. Here we describe the implementation details of the device and discuss possible interactions using the device.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Keio University", "University of Tokyo", "JST ERATO Igara ... , Bunkyo, Japan", "JST ERATO Igara ... , Bunkyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Sunao Hashimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashimoto:Sunao", "Ryohei Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Ryohei", "Yoichi Kamiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamiyama:Yoichi", "Masahiko Inami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inami:Masahiko", "Takeo Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Takeo"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
