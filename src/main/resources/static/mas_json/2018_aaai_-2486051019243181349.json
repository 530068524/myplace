{"title": "Relational Marginal Problems: Theory and Estimation.", "fields": ["training set", "estimator", "polytope", "test data", "effective sample size"], "abstract": "In the propositional setting, the marginal problem is to\nfind a (maximum-entropy) distribution that has some given\nmarginals. We study this problem in a relational setting and\nmake the following contributions. First, we compare two different\nnotions of relational marginals. Second, we show a duality\nbetween the resulting relational marginal problems and\nthe maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of relational\nmodels, which generalizes a well-known duality from\nthe propositional setting. Third, by exploiting the relational\nmarginal formulation, we present a statistically sound method\nto learn the parameters of relational models that will be applied\nin settings where the number of constants differs between\nthe training and test data. Furthermore, based on a relational\ngeneralization of marginal polytopes, we characterize\ncases where the standard estimators based on feature\u2019s number\nof true groundings needs to be adjusted and we quantitatively\ncharacterize the consequences of these adjustments.\nFourth, we prove bounds on expected errors of the estimated\nparameters, which allows us to lower-bound, among other\nthings, the effective sample size of relational training data.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Cardiff University", "ETH Zurich", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Cardiff University"], "authors": ["Ondrej Kuzelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzelka:Ondrej", "Yuyi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuyi", "Jesse Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Jesse", "Steven Schockaert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schockaert:Steven"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
