This paper aims at minimization of the communication overhead in client-server architectures, where a server continuously maintains the skyline of dynamic objects. Our first contribution is a Filter method that avoids transmission of updates from objects that cannot influence the skyline. Specifically, each object is assigned a filter so that it needs to issue an update only if it violates its filter. Filter achieves significant savings over the naive approach of transmitting all updates. Going one step further, we introduce the concept of frequent skyline query over a sliding window(FSQW). The motivation is that snapshot skylines are not very useful in streaming environments because they keep changing over time. Instead, FSQW reports the objects that appear in the skylines of at least \u03b8 \u22c5  s  of the  s  most recent timestamps ( 0", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "University of Hong Kong", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Zhenjie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhenjie", "Reynold Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Reynold", "Dimitris Papadias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadias:Dimitris", "Anthony K.
