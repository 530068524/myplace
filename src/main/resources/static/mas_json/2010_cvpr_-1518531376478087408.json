Typically, the regions are selected beforehand and then an energy function is defined over them. This two step process suffers from the following deficiencies: (i) the regions may not match the boundaries of the scene entities, thereby introducing errors; and (ii) as the regions are obtained without any knowledge of the energy function, they may not be suitable for the task at hand. We address these problems by designing an efficient approach for obtaining the best set of regions in terms of the energy function itself. Each iteration of our algorithm selects regions from a large dictionary by solving an accurate linear programming relaxation via dual decomposition. The dictionary of regions is constructed by merging and intersecting segments obtained from multiple bottom-up over-segmentations. To demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm, we consider the task of scene segmentation and show significant improvements over state of the art methods.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["M.
