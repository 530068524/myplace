{"title": "Content Models for Survey Generation: A Factoid-Based Evaluation.", "fields": ["bayesian probability", "pyramid", "pattern recognition", "factoid", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "We present a new factoid-annotated dataset for evaluating content models for scientific survey article generation containing 3,425 sentences from 7 topics in natural language processing. We also introduce a novel HITS-based content model for automated survey article generation called HITSUM that exploits the lexical network structure between sentences from citing and cited papers. Using the factoid-annotated data, we conduct a pyramid evaluation and compare HITSUM with two previous state-of-the-art content models: C-Lexrank, a network based content model, and TOPICSUM, a Bayesian content model. Our experiments show that our new content model captures useful survey-worthy information and outperforms C-Lexrank by 4% and TOPICSUM by 7% in pyramid evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Rahul Jha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jha:Rahul", "Catherine Finegan-Dollak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finegan=Dollak:Catherine", "Ben King.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King:Ben", "Reed Coke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coke:Reed", "Dragomir R.
