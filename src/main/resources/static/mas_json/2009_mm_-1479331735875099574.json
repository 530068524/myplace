{"title": "Automatic and instant ring tone generation based on music structure analysis.", "fields": ["singing", "laptop", "digital audio", "pattern recognition", "heuristic"], "abstract": "Real tones, which are often excerpts from pop songs, have become popular as ring tones. This paper describes how a ring tone can be produced by analyzing the structure of music and selecting the most appropriate portion of the music. With audio feature analysis and pattern recognition methods, the structure of a song can be estimated by deploying both singing voice detection and repetition detection. Then, one or more ring tones can be automatically selected from the song according to heuristic rules. The entire process takes only a few seconds. It is greatly superior in efficiency and ease-of-use than currently available ring tone generation approaches, and can be used in handheld devices, desktop or laptop PCs and web services. Moreover, this unique music structure analysis technology we developed may be used in many other applications as well, such as for browsing, searching and shopping digital music.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Tong", "Chee Keat Fong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fong:Chee_Keat", "Linxing Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Linxing", "Jie Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Jie"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
