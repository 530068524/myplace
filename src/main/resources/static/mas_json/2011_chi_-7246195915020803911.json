Sialorrhea, or drooling, is a significant problem associated with PD and has a strong negative emotional impact on those who experience it. Previous studies have shown the potential for managing drooling by using a cueing device. However, the devices used in these studies were deemed unacceptable by their users due to factors such as hearing impairment and social embarrassment. We conducted exploratory scoping work and high fidelity iterative prototyping with people with PD to get their input on the design of a cueing aid and this has given us an insight into challenges that confront users with PD and limit device usability and acceptability. The key finding from working with people with PD was the need for the device to be socially acceptable.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Roisin McNaney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McNaney:Roisin", "Stephen Lindsay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindsay:Stephen", "Karim Ladha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ladha:Karim", "Cassim Ladha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ladha:Cassim", "Guy Schofield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schofield:Guy", "Thomas Pl\u00f6tz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pl=ouml=tz:Thomas", "Nils Y.
