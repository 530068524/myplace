The central challenge is to create statistical recognition models that are accurate and resource-efficient in the face of the variety of natural language, while requiring little specialized knowledge from developers. We show that given a few examples from the developer, it is possible to elicit comprehensive sets of paraphrases of the examples using internet crowds. The exhaustive nature of these paraphrases allows us to use relatively simple, automatically derived statistical models for speech and language understanding that perform well without per-application tuning. We have realized our design fully as an extension to the Visual Studio IDE. Based on a new benchmark dataset with 3500 spoken instances of 27 commands from 20 subjects and a small developer study, we establish the promise of our approach and the impact of various design choices.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Seungyeop Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Seungyeop", "Matthai Philipose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Philipose:Matthai", "Yun-Cheng Ju.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ju:Yun=Cheng"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
