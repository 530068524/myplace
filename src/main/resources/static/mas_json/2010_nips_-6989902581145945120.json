However, for most practical problems, probability densities can be represented only approximately. Choosing an approximation requires balancing the benefits of an accurate approximation against the costs of computing it. We propose a variational framework for achieving this balance and apply it to the problem of how a neural population code should optimally represent a distribution under resource constraints. The essence of our analysis is the conjecture that population codes are organized to maximize a lower bound on the log expected utility. This theory can account for a plethora of experimental data, including the reward-modulation of sensory receptive fields, GABAergic effects on saccadic movements, and risk aversion in decisions under uncertainty.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Samuel Gershman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gershman:Samuel", "Robert Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Robert"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
