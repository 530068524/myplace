How do you figure out that a lie has been told often enough that it is now considered to be true? How many lying sources are required to introduce confusion in what you knew before to be the truth? To answer these questions, we present AllegatorTrack, a system that discovers true claims among conflicting data from multiple sources.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Dalia Attia Waguih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waguih:Dalia_Attia", "Naman Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Naman", "Hossam M.
