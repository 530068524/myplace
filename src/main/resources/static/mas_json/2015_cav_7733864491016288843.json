{"title": "A Type-Directed Approach to Program Repair.", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "programmer", "enterprise software", "learning curve", "compiler"], "abstract": "Developing enterprise software often requires composing several libraries together with a large body of in-house code. Large APIs introduce a steep learning curve for new developers as a result of their complex object-oriented underpinnings. While the written code in general reflects a programmer\u2019s intent, due to evolutions in an API, code can often become ill-typed, yet still syntactically-correct. Such code fragments will no longer compile, and will need to be updated. We describe an algorithm that automatically repairs such errors, and discuss its application to common problems in software engineering.\nOpen image in new window", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Alex Reinking.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reinking:Alex", "Ruzica Piskac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piskac:Ruzica"], "pages": 7}
