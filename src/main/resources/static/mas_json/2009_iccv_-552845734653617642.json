We provide a novel framework for reconstructing scene geometry from a single viewpoint using a camera that captures a 3D time-image I(x, y, t) for each pixel. We propose a framework that uses the time-image and transient reasoning to expose scene properties that may be beyond the reach of traditional computer vision. We corroborate our theory with free space hardware experiments using a femtosecond laser and an ultrafast photo detector array. The ability to compute the geometry of hidden elements, unobservable by both the camera and illumination source, will create a range of new computer vision opportunities.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ahmed Kirmani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirmani:Ahmed", "Tyler Hutchison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hutchison:Tyler", "James Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:James", "Ramesh Raskar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raskar:Ramesh"], "pages": 8}
