We propose a novel graphical model, namely Latent Differential Graph Model, where the networks under two different conditions are represented by two semiparametric elliptical distributions respectively, and the variation of these two networks (i.e., differential graph) is characterized by the difference between their latent precision matrices. We propose an estimator for the differential graph based on quasi likelihood maximization with nonconvex regularization. We show that our estimator attains a faster statistical rate in parameter estimation than the state-of-the-art methods, and enjoys oracle property under mild conditions. Thorough experiments on both synthetic and real world data support our theory.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Pan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Pan", "Quanquan Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Quanquan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
