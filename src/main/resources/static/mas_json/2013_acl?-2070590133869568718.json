In decoding, a distortion model estimates the source word position to be translated next (NP) given the last translated source word position (CP). We propose a distortion model that can consider the word at the CP, a word at an NP candidate, and the context of the CP and the NP candidate simultaneously. Moreover, we propose a further improved model that considers richer context by discriminating label sequences that specify spans from the CP to NP candidates. It enables our model to learn the effect of relative word order among NP candidates as well as to learn the effect of distances from the training data. In our experiments, our model improved 2.9 BLEU points for Japanese-English and 2.6 BLEU points for Chinese-English translation compared to the lexical reordering models.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "Kyoto University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Isao Goto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goto:Isao", "Masao Utiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Utiyama:Masao", "Eiichiro Sumita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sumita:Eiichiro", "Akihiro Tamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamura:Akihiro", "Sadao Kurohashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurohashi:Sadao"], "pages": 11}
