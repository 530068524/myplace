In this paper, we show that this problem can be formalized as a classical optimization task from operations research, in ways that accommodate different requirements for multiple users, different query sensitivities to load shedding, and different penalty functions. Standard non-linear programming algorithms are adequate for non-critical situations, but for severe overloads, we propose a more efficient algorithm that runs in linear time, without compromising optimality. Our approach is applicable to a large class of queries including traditional SQL aggregates, statistical aggregates (e.g., quantiles), and data mining functions, such as k-means, naive Bayesian classifiers, decision trees, and frequent pattern discovery (where we can even specify a different error bound for each pattern). In fact, we show that these aggregate queries are special instances of a broader class of functions, that we call reciprocal-error aggregates, for which the proposed methods apply with full generality. Finally, we propose a novel architecture for supporting load shedding in an extensible system, where users can write arbitrary User Defined Aggregates (UDA), and thus confirm our analytical findings with several experiments executed on an actual DSMS.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Barzan Mozafari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mozafari:Barzan", "Carlo Zaniolo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaniolo:Carlo"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 13}
