We argue that this increases the resistance to shoulder surfing while remaining reasonably fast and easy-to-use. We performed a user study ( n =24) comparing BoD Shapes to PIN authentication, Android grid unlock, and a front version of our system. Testing a front version allowed us to directly compare performance and security measures between front and back authentication. Our results show that BoD Shapes is significantly more secure than the three other approaches. While performance declined, our results show that BoD Shapes can be very fast (up to 1.5 seconds in the user study) and that learning effects have an influence on its performance. This indicates that speed improvements can be expected in long-term use.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Alexander De Luca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luca:Alexander_De", "Emanuel von Zezschwitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zezschwitz:Emanuel_von", "Ngo Dieu Huong Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Ngo_Dieu_Huong", "Max-Emanuel Maurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maurer:Max=Emanuel", "Elisa Rubegni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubegni:Elisa", "Marcello Paolo Scipioni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scipioni:Marcello_Paolo", "Marc Langheinrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langheinrich:Marc"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
