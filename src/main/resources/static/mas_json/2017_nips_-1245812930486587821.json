{"title": "Interpretable and Globally Optimal Prediction for Textual Grounding using Image Concepts.", "fields": ["bounding overwatch", "interpretability", "robotics", "minimum bounding box", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Textual grounding is an important but challenging task for human-computer inter- action, robotics and knowledge mining. Existing algorithms generally formulate the task as selection from a set of bounding box proposals obtained from deep net based systems. In this work, we demonstrate that we can cast the problem of textual grounding into a unified framework that permits efficient search over all possible bounding boxes. Hence, the method is able to consider significantly more proposals and doesn\u2019t rely on a successful first stage hypothesizing bounding box proposals. Beyond, we demonstrate that the trained parameters of our model can be used as word-embeddings which capture spatial-image relationships and provide interpretability. Lastly, at the time of submission, our approach outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods on the Flickr 30k Entities and the ReferItGame dataset by 3.08% and 7.77% respectively.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "IBM", "National Center for Supercomputing Applications", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Raymond Yeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeh:Raymond", "Jinjun Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Jinjun", "Wen-Mei W.
