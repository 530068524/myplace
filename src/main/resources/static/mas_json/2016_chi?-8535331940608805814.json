{"title": "Behavior Ever Follows Intention?: A Validation of the Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS).", "fields": ["phishing", "lock screen", "password", "theory of planned behavior", "software"], "abstract": "The Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) measures the computer security attitudes of end-users. Because intentions are a prerequisite for planned behavior, the scale could therefore be useful for predicting users' computer security behaviors. We performed three experiments to identify correlations between each of SeBIS's four sub-scales and relevant computer security behaviors. We found that testing high on the awareness sub-scale correlated with correctly identifying a phishing website; testing high on the passwords sub-scale correlated with creating passwords that could not be quickly cracked; testing high on the updating sub-scale correlated with applying software updates; and testing high on the securement sub-scale correlated with smartphone lock screen usage (e.g., PINs). Our results indicate that SeBIS predicts certain computer security behaviors and that it is a reliable and valid tool that should be used in future research.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["International Computer Science Institute", "International Computer Science Institute", "Bar-Ilan University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Serge Egelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egelman:Serge", "Marian Harbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harbach:Marian", "Eyal P\u00e9er.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=eacute=er:Eyal"], "pages": 5}
