{"title": "How to make words with vectors: Phrase generation in distributional semantics.", "fields": ["expression", "distributional semantics", "paraphrase", "noun phrase", "statistical semantics"], "abstract": "We introduce the problem of generation in distributional semantics: Given a distributional vector representing some meaning, how can we generate the phrase that best expresses that meaning? We motivate this novel challenge on theoretical and practical grounds and propose a simple data-driven approach to the estimation of generation functions. We test this in a monolingual scenario (paraphrase generation) as well as in a cross-lingual setting (translation by synthesizing adjectivenoun phrase vectors in English and generating the equivalent expressions in Italian).", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Georgiana Dinu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinu:Georgiana", "Marco Baroni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baroni:Marco"], "pages": 10}
