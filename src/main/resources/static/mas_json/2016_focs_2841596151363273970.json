This yields a nearly tight n1/2\u2013o(1)) bound on the value of this program for any degree d = o(log n). Moreover we introduce a new framework that we call pseudo-calibration to construct Sum-of-Squares lower bounds. This framework is inspired by taking a computational analogue of Bayesian probability theory. It yields a general recipe for constructing good pseudo-distributions (i.e., dual certificates for the Sum-of-Squares semidefinite program), and sheds further light on the ways in which this hierarchy differs from others.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Cornell University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Boaz Barak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barak:Boaz", "Samuel B.
