{"title": "Verifying Pushdown Multi-Agent Systems against Strategy Logics.", "fields": ["implementation", "model checking", "discrete mathematics", "multi agent system", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate model checking algorithms for variants of strategy logic over pushdown multi-agent systems, modeled by pushdown game structures (PGSs). We consider various fragments of strategy logic, i.e., SL[CG], SL[DG], SL[1G] and BSIL. We show that the model checking problems on PGSs for SL[CG], SL[DG] and SL[1G] are 3EXTIME-complete, which are not harder than the problem for the subsumed logic ATL*. When BSIL is concerned, the model checking problem becomes 2EXPTIME-complete. Our algorithms are automata-theoretic and based on the saturation technique, which are amenable to implementations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Middlesex University", "East China Normal University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Taolue Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Taolue", "Fu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Fu", "Zhilin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Zhilin"], "pages": 7}
