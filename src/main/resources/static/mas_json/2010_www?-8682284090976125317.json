{"title": "Faceted exploration of image search results.", "fields": ["ranking", "world wide web", "systems architecture", "web search query", "search engine"], "abstract": "This paper describes MediaFaces, a system that enables faceted exploration of media collections. The system processes semi-structured information sources to extract objects and facets, e.g. the relationships between two objects. Next, we rank the facets based on a statistical analysis of image search query logs, and the tagging behaviour of users annotating photos in Flickr. For a given object of interest, we can then retrieve the top-k most relevant facets and present them to the user. The system is currently deployed in production by Yahoo!'s image search engine 1 . We present the system architecture, its main components, and the application of the system as part of the image search experience.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Roelof van Zwol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwol:Roelof_van", "B\u00f6rkur Sigurbj\u00f6rnsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sigurbj=ouml=rnsson:B=ouml=rkur", "Ramu Adapala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adapala:Ramu", "Lluis Garcia Pueyo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pueyo:Lluis_Garcia", "Abhinav Katiyar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katiyar:Abhinav", "Kaushal Kurapati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurapati:Kaushal", "Mridul Muralidharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muralidharan:Mridul", "Sudar Muthu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muthu:Sudar", "Vanessa Murdock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murdock:Vanessa", "Polly Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Polly", "Anand Ramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramani:Anand", "Anuj Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Anuj", "Sriram Thiru Sathish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sathish:Sriram_Thiru", "Hari Vasudev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasudev:Hari", "Upendra Vuyyuru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vuyyuru:Upendra"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
