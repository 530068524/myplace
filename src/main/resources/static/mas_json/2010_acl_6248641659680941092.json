{"title": "Open-Domain Semantic Role Labeling by Modeling Word Spans.", "fields": ["semantic computing", "training set", "natural language processing", "semantic role labeling", "language model"], "abstract": "Most supervised language processing systems show a significant drop-off in performance when they are tested on text that comes from a domain significantly different from the domain of the training data. Semantic role labeling techniques are typically trained on newswire text, and in tests their performance on fiction is as much as 19% worse than their performance on newswire text. We investigate techniques for building open-domain semantic role labeling systems that approach the ideal of a train-once, use-anywhere system. We leverage recently-developed techniques for learning representations of text using latent-variable language models, and extend these techniques to ones that provide the kinds of features that are useful for semantic role labeling. In experiments, our novel system reduces error by 16% relative to the previous state of the art on out-of-domain text.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Fei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Fei", "Alexander Yates.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yates:Alexander"], "pages": 11}
