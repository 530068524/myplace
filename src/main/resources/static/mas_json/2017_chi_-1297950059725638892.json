{"title": "XDBrowser 2.0: Semi-Automatic Generation of Cross-Device Interfaces.", "fields": ["software design pattern", "web navigation", "wearable technology", "web design", "web page"], "abstract": "Several recent studies have highlighted the need to support parallel usage of multiple devices for cross-device use. Yet, most interfaces today are still designed for single-device use and require re-authoring to enable cross-device interaction. This paper presents two studies to inform the design of a new web browser with support for semi-automatic generation of cross-device interfaces. Based on the results of a recent study in which users manually customized web pages for cross-device use, our first study elicits from users how they might want to trigger popular cross-device patterns to transform single-device designs with relatively little effort. Our second study then examines how the emerging design patterns could be applied to the Alexa top 50 sites from 10 different genres. Based on these studies, we design semi-automatic techniques for page segmentation and distribution between multiple devices that can work on many existing web sites and require only minimal user input to switch between different cross-device designs. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to the Chrome web browser to make the techniques available for a wide range of desktop, mobile, and wearable devices, and successfully test them on popular web sites.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Michael Nebeling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nebeling:Michael"], "pages": 11}
