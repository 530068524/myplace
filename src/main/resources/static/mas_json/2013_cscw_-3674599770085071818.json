This qualitative study of post-doctoral researchers' use of preexisting datasets investigates the practices of cancer-epidemiology post-docs working to understand their \"Small Data\" datasets. We report the ongoing and iterative nature of information seeking inherent in using unfamiliar data and the time-consuming and highly-collaborative process post-docs used to understand aspects of the dataset important to their scientific questions. Understanding data use practices can help inform the design of both Small Data projects and large cyberinfrastructure projects where multi-source data are collected and combined.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Betsy Rolland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rolland:Betsy", "Charlotte P.
