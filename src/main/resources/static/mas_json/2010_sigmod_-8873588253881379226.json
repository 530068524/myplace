XTaGe focuses on XML collections with complex structural constraints and domain-specific characteristics, which would be very difficult or impossible to replicate using existing XML generators. It addresses the limitations of current XML generators by providing a highly extensible framework to introduce controlled variability in XML structures.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["James I University", "James I University", "James I University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Catal\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catal=aacute=n:Mar=iacute=a_P=eacute=rez", "Ismael Sanz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanz:Ismael", "Rafael Berlanga Llavori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Llavori:Rafael_Berlanga"], "pages": 4}
