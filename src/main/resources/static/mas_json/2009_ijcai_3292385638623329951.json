{"title": "Import-by-Query: Ontology Reasoning under Access Limitations.", "fields": ["physical access", "semantic reasoner", "axiom", "ontology language", "publication"], "abstract": "To enable ontology reuse, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) allows an ontology \u03bav to import an ontology \u03bah. To reason with such a \u03bav, a reasoner needs physical access to the axioms of \u03bah. For copyright and/or privacy reasons, however, the authors of \u03bah might not want to publish the axioms of \u03bah; instead, they might prefer to provide an oracle that can answer a (limited) set of queries over \u03bah, thus allowing \u03bav to import \u03bah \"by query.\" In this paper, we study import-by-query algorithms, which can answer questions about \u03bav \u222a \u03bah by accessing only \u03bav and the oracle. We show that no such algorithm exists in general, and present restrictions under which importing by query becomes feasible.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Bernardo Cuenca Grau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grau:Bernardo_Cuenca", "Boris Motik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motik:Boris", "Yevgeny Kazakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazakov:Yevgeny"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
