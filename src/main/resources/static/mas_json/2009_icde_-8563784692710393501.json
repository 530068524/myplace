In this paper, we study the problem of efficient processing of continuous skyline queries over sliding windows on uncertain data elements regarding given probability thresholds. We first characterize what kind of elements we need to keep in our query computation. Then we show the size of dynamically maintained candidate set and the size of skyline. We develop novel, efficient techniques to process a continuous, probabilistic skyline query. Finally, we extend our techniques to the applications where multiple probability thresholds are given or we want to retrieve \"top-k\" skyline data objects. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed techniques are very efficient and handle a high-speed data stream in real time.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Wenjie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wenjie", "Xuemin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xuemin", "Ying Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Ying", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0011:Wei", "Jeffrey Xu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jeffrey_Xu"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
