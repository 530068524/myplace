Short text is different from traditional documents in its shortness and sparsity, which hinders the application of conventional machine learning and text mining algorithms. Two major approaches have been exploited to enrich the representation of short text. One is to fetch contextual information of a short text to directly add more text; the other is to derive latent topics from existing large corpus, which are used as features to enrich the representation of short text. The latter approach is elegant and efficient in most cases. The major trend along this direction is to derive latent topics of certain granularity through well-known topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). However, topics of certain granularity are usually not sufficient to set up effective feature spaces. In this paper, we move forward along this direction by proposing an method to leverage topics at multiple granularity, which can model the short text more precisely. Taking short text classification as an example, we compared our proposed method with the state-of-the-art baseline over one open data set. Our method reduced the classification error by 20.25% and 16.68% respectively on two classifiers.", "citation": "Citations (163)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Buzzlabs, Bellevue WA"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Mengen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Mengen", "Xiaoming Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xiaoming", "Dou Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Dou"], "pages": 6}
