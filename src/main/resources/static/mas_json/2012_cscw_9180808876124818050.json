However, this task is complicated by the fact that many NFRs conflict with each other from multiple perspectives. It is essential to resolve conflicts collectively in a collaborative decision making process since stakeholders often disagree on how conflicts should be resolved. In this paper, we describe a method for dividing high-level NFR conflicts within a product line into more manageable sub-problems. Stakeholders make use of an argumentation based collaborative decision support system to determine which design alternatives provide the best trade-offs between NFRs. Finally, we present an empirical study in which the aforementioned system was used to resolve a single instance of an NFR conflict across 3 members of a product line. It shows that the system is effective in resolving conflicts in a collaborative decision process.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Missouri University of Science and Technology", "Missouri University of Science and Technology", "Danfoss Power E ... r\u00e5sten, Denmark"], "authors": ["Xiaoqing (Frank) Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaoqing_=Frank=", "Eric Christopher Barnes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barnes:Eric_Christopher", "Juha Erik Savolainen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savolainen:Juha_Erik"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
