{"title": "Logic for communicating automata with parameterized topology.", "fields": ["mathematical proof", "realizability", "parameterized complexity", "fifo", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We introduce parameterized communicating automata (PCA) as a model of systems where finite-state processes communicate through FIFO channels. Unlike classical communicating automata, a given PCA can be run on any network topology of bounded degree. The topology is thus a parameter of the system. We provide various Buchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot theorems for PCA, which roughly read as follows: Given a logical specification \u03c6 and a class of topologies T there is a PCA that is equivalent to \u03c6 on all topologies from T. We give uniform constructions which allow us to instantiate T with concrete classes such as pipelines, ranked trees, grids, rings, etc. The proofs build on a locality theorem for first-order logic due to Schwentick and Barthelmann, and they exploit concepts from the non-parameterized case, notably a result by Genest, Kuske, and Muscholl.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Benedikt Bollig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bollig:Benedikt"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
