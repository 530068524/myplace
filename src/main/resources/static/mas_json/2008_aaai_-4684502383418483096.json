{"title": "Single Document Keyphrase Extraction Using Neighborhood Knowledge.", "fields": ["small number", "k nearest neighbors algorithm", "document clustering", "graph", "ranking"], "abstract": "Existing methods for single document keyphrase extraction usually make use of only the information contained in the specified document. This paper proposes to use a small number of nearest neighbor documents to provide more knowledge to improve single document keyphrase extraction. A specified document is expanded to a small document set by adding a few neighbor documents close to the document, and the graph-based ranking algorithm is then applied on the expanded document set to make use of both the local information in the specified document and the global information in the neighbor documents. Experimental results demonstrate the good effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (227)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Xiaojun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan_0001:Xiaojun", "Jianguo Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Jianguo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
