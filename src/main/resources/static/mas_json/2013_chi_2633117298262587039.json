This is problematic as the technical limitations of video fractures the display of conduct in the connected environments. We present the results of a study of one collaborative system, CamBlend, which aims to alleviate some of these problems by using screen based pointing tools to both physical spaces and virtual resources. We report on how participants achieved co-orientation when using this system. We relate these findings to previous research into the fractured ecologies of collaborative spaces, describing how the form and nature of fractures in CamBlend differ from earlier reported work.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "King's College London"], "authors": ["James Norris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norris:James", "Holger Schn\u00e4delbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schn=auml=delbach:Holger", "Paul K.
