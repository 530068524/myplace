We address the challenges of transfer learning in heterogeneous environments with varying tasks. We present an efficient, online framework that, through a sequence of tasks, learns a set of relevant representations to be used in future tasks. Without predefined mapping strategies, we introduce a general approach to support transfer learning across different state spaces. We demonstrate the potential impact of our system through improved jumpstart and faster convergence to near optimum policy in two benchmark domains.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Trung Thanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen_0005:Trung_Thanh", "Tomi Silander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silander:Tomi", "Tze-Yun Leong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leong:Tze=Yun"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
