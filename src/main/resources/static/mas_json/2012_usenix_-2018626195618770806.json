{"title": "Managing Large Graphs on Multi-Cores with Graph Awareness.", "fields": ["graph bandwidth", "graph", "graph product", "clique width", "graph database"], "abstract": "Grace is a graph-aware, in-memory, transactional graph management system, specifically built for real-time queries and fast iterative computations. It is designed to run on large multi-cores, taking advantage of the inherent parallelism to improve its performance. Grace contains a number of graph-specific and multi-core-specific optimizations including graph partitioning, careful in-memory vertex ordering, updates batching, and load-balancing. It supports queries, searches, iterative computations, and transactional updates. Grace scales to large graphs (e.g., a Hotmail graph with 320 million vertices) and performs up to two orders of magnitude faster than commercial key-value stores and graph databases.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Vijayan Prabhakaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakaran:Vijayan", "Ming Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ming", "Xuetian Weng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weng:Xuetian", "Frank McSherry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McSherry:Frank", "Lidong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Lidong", "Maya Haradasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haradasan:Maya"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
