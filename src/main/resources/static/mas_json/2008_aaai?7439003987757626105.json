This approach reduces learning to the problem of recovering a utility function that makes the behavior induced by a near-optimal policy closely mimic demonstrated behavior. In this work, we develop a probabilistic approach based on the principle of maximum entropy. Our approach provides a well-defined, globally normalized distribution over decision sequences, while providing the same performance guarantees as existing methods.\n\nWe develop our technique in the context of modeling real-world navigation and driving behaviors where collected data is inherently noisy and imperfect. Our probabilistic approach enables modeling of route preferences as well as a powerful new approach to inferring destinations and routes based on partial trajectories.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Adobe Systems", "University of North Carolina at Asheville", "University of Georgia", "University of Georgia", "University of Georgia"], "authors": ["Brian D.
