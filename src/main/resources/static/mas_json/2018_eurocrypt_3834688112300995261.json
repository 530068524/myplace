{"title": "Memory Lower Bounds of Reductions Revisited.", "fields": ["upper and lower bounds", "uniqueness", "theoretical computer science", "cryptographic primitive", "hash function"], "abstract": "In Crypto 2017, Auerbach et al. initiated the study on memory-tight reductions and proved two negative results on the memory-tightness of restricted black-box reductions from multi-challenge security to single-challenge security for signatures and an artificial hash function. In this paper, we revisit the results by Auerbach et al. and show that for a large class of reductions treating multi-challenge security, it is impossible to avoid loss of memory-tightness unless we sacrifice the efficiency of their running-time. Specifically, we show three lower bound results. Firstly, we show a memory lower bound of natural black-box reductions from the multi-challenge unforgeability of unique signatures to any computational assumption. Then we show a lower bound of restricted reductions from multi-challenge security to single-challenge security for a wide class of cryptographic primitives with unique keys in the multi-user setting. Finally, we extend the lower bound result shown by Auerbach et al. treating a hash function to one treating any hash function with a large domain.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Yuyu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuyu", "Takahiro Matsuda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsuda_0002:Takahiro", "Goichiro Hanaoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanaoka:Goichiro", "Keisuke Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Keisuke"], "pages": 30}
