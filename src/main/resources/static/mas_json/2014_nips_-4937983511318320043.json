In this paper we present an approach for training a convolutional neural network using only unlabeled data. We train the network to discriminate between a set of surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of transformations to a randomly sampled 'seed' image patch. We find that this simple feature learning algorithm is surprisingly successful when applied to visual object recognition. The feature representation learned by our algorithm achieves classification results matching or outperforming the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101).", "citation": "Citations (239)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alexey Dosovitskiy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dosovitskiy:Alexey", "Jost Tobias Springenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Springenberg:Jost_Tobias", "Martin A.
