The space of weight vectors in the BN layer can be naturally interpreted as a Riemannian manifold, which is invariant to linear scaling of weights. Following the intrinsic geometry of this manifold provides a new learning rule that is more efficient and easier to analyze. We also propose intuitive and effective gradient clipping and regularization methods for the proposed algorithm by utilizing the geometry of the manifold. The resulting algorithm consistently outperforms the original BN on various types of network architectures and datasets.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Gracenote", "Gracenote"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Minhyung Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Minhyung", "Jaehyung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jaehyung"], "pages": 11}
