Despite the NP-hard nature of the problem, fast and accurate approximations have led to significant progress in a wide range of applications. Learning graph models from observed data, however, still remains a challenging issue. This paper presents an effective scheme to parameterize a graph model, and learn its structural attributes for visual object matching. For this, we propose a graph representation with histogram-based attributes, and optimize them to increase the matching accuracy. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and show significant improvement in matching accuracy over graphs with pre-defined structures.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Minsu Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Minsu", "Karteek Alahari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alahari:Karteek", "Jean Ponce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponce:Jean"], "pages": 8}
