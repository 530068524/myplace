When submitting a query, each user also submits a bid of how much she is willing to pay for that query to run. The admission control auction mechanism then determines which queries to admit, and how much to charge each user in a way that maximizes system revenue while being strategyproof and sybil immune, incentivizing users to use the system honestly. Specifically, we require that each user maximizes her payoff by bidding her true value of having her query run. We design several payment mechanisms and experimentally evaluate them. We describe the provable game theoretic characteristics of each mechanism alongside its performance with respect to maximizing profit and total user payoff.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "Connecticut College", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Lory Al Moakar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moakar:Lory_Al", "Panos K.
