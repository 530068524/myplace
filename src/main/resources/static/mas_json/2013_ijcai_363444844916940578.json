{"title": "Cyclic Causal Models with Discrete Variables: Markov Chain Equilibrium Semantics and Sample Ordering.", "fields": ["continuous time markov chain", "balance equation", "additive markov chain", "markov chain mixing time", "causal markov condition"], "abstract": "We analyze the foundations of cyclic causal models for discrete variables, and compare structural equation models (SEMs) to an alternative semantics as the equilibrium (stationary) distribution of a Markov chain. We show under general conditions, discrete cyclic SEMs cannot have independent noise; even in the simplest case, cyclic structural equation models imply constraints on the noise. We give a formalization of an alternative Markov chain equilibrium semantics which requires not only the causal graph, but also a sample order. We show how the resulting equilibrium is a function of the sample ordering, both theoretically and empirically.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["David Poole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poole_0001:David", "Mark Crowley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crowley_0001:Mark"], "pages": 9}
