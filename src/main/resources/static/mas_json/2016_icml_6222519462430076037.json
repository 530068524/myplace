Such certificates and corresponding rate of convergence guarantees are important for practitioners to diagnose progress, in particular in machine learning applications.\n\nWe obtain new primal-dual convergence rates, e.g., for the Lasso as well as many L1, Elastic Net, group Lasso and TV-regularized problems. The theory applies to any norm-regularized generalized linear model. Our approach provides efficiently computable duality gaps which are globally defined, without modifying the original problems in the region of interest.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["IBM", "ETH Zurich", "Lehigh University", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Celestine D\u00fcnner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=uuml=nner:Celestine", "Simone Forte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forte:Simone", "Martin Tak\u00e1c.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tak=aacute=c:Martin", "Martin Jaggi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaggi:Martin"], "pages": 10}
