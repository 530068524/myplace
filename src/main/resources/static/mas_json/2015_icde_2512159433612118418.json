Due to the computational hardness of subgraph queries coupled with the cost of managing massive graph data, outsourcing the query computation to a third-party service provider has been an economical and scalable approach. However, confidentiality is known to be an important attribute of Quality of Service (QoS) in Query as a Service (QaaS). In this paper, we propose the first practical private approach for subgraph query services, asymmetric structure-preserving subgraph query processing, where the data graph is publicly known and the query structure/topology is kept secret. Unlike other previous methods for subgraph queries, this paper proposes a series of novel optimizations that only exploit graph structures, not the queries. Further, we propose a robust query encoding and adopt the novel cyclic group based encryption so that query processing is transformed into a series of private matrix operations. Our experiments confirm that our techniques are efficient and the optimizations are effective.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Zhe Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Zhe", "Byron Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Byron", "Jianliang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jianliang", "Sourav S.
