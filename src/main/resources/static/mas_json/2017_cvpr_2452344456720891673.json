This paper presents a method to jointly perform radiometric calibration for a set of images in an Internet photo collection. By incorporating the consistency of scene reflectance for corresponding pixels in multiple images, the proposed method estimates radiometric response functions of all the images using a rank minimization framework. Our calibration aligns all response functions in an image set up to the same exponential ambiguity in a robust manner. Quantitative results using both synthetic and real data show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Osaka University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhipeng Mo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mo:Zhipeng", "Boxin Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Boxin", "Sai-Kit Yeung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeung:Sai=Kit", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki"], "pages": 9}
