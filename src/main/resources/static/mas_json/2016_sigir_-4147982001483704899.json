{"title": "ThingSeek: A Crawler and Search Engine for the Internet of Things.", "fields": ["web crawler", "unavailability", "web of things", "big data", "internet of things"], "abstract": "The rapidly growing paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires new search engines, which can crawl heterogeneous data sources and search in highly dynamic contexts. Existing search engines cannot meet these requirements as they are designed for traditional Web and human users only. This is contrary to the fact that things are emerging as major producers and consumers of information. Currently, there is very little work on searching IoT and a number of works claim the unavailability of public IoT data. However, it is dismissed that a majority of real-time web-based maps are sharing data that is generated by things, directly. To shed light on this line of research, in this paper, we firstly create a set of tools to capture IoT data from a set of given data sources. We then create two types of interfaces to provide real-time searching services on dynamic IoT data for both human and machine users.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Huddersfield"], "authors": ["Ali Shemshadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shemshadi:Ali", "Quan Z.
