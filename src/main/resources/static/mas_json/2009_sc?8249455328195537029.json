{"title": "Increasing memory miss tolerance for SIMD cores.", "fields": ["uniform memory access", "interleaved memory", "cas latency", "memory model", "simd"], "abstract": "Manycore processors with wide SIMD cores are becoming a popular choice for the next generation of throughput oriented architectures. We introduce a hardware technique called \"diverge on miss\" that allows SIMD cores to better tolerate memory latency for workloads with non-contiguous memory access patterns. Individual threads within a SIMD \"warp\" are allowed to slip behind other threads in the same warp, letting the warp continue execution even if a subset of threads are waiting on memory. Diverge on miss can either increase the performance of a given design by up to a factor of 3.14 for a single warp per core, or reduce the number of warps per core needed to sustain a given level of performance from 16 to 2 warps, reducing the area per core by 35%.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["David Tarjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarjan:David", "Jiayuan Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Jiayuan", "Kevin Skadron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skadron:Kevin"], "pages": -1}
