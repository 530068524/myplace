{"title": "Readability of scanned books in digital libraries.", "fields": ["world wide web", "multimedia", "scrolling", "readability", "digital library"], "abstract": "Displaying scanned book pages in a web browser is difficult, due to an array of characteristics of the common user's configuration that compound to yield text that is degraded and illegibly small. For books which contain only text, this can often be solved by using OCR or manual transcription to extract and present the text alone, or by magnifying the page and presenting it in a scrolling panel. Books with rich illustrations, especially children's picture books, present a greater challenge because their enjoyment is dependent on reading the text in the context of the full page with its illustrations. We have created two novel prototypes for solving this problem by magnifying just the text, without magnifying the entire page. We present the results of a user study of these techniques. Users found our prototypes to be more effective than the dominant interface type for reading this kind of material and, in some cases, even preferable to the physical book itself.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Hitachi", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alexander J.
