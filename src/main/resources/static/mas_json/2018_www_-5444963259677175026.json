{"title": "Through a Gender Lens: Learning Usage Patterns of Emojis from Large-Scale Android Users.", "fields": ["data mining", "android", "user information", "inference", "emoji"], "abstract": "Based on a large dataset of emoji usage collected from smartphone users across the world, this paper investigates usage of emojis from the gender perspective. We present various interesting findings that evidence a considerable difference in emoji usage between male and female users. Such a difference is significant not just in a statistical sense; it is sufficient for a machine learning algorithm to accurately infer the gender of a user purely based on the emojis used in their messages. In real-world scenarios where gender inference is a necessity, models based on emojis have unique advantages over existing models that are based on the textual or contextual information. Emojis not only provide the language-independent indicator, but also alleviate the risk of leaking private user information through the analysis of text and context.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "University of Michigan", "Peking University", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Zhenpeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhenpeng", "Xuan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Xuan", "Wei Ai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ai:Wei", "Huoran Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Huoran", "Qiaozhu Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Qiaozhu", "Xuanzhe Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xuanzhe"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
