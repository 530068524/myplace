{"title": "Fobs: an open source object-oriented library for accessing multimedia content.", "fields": ["encapsulation", "codec", "multimedia", "data compression", "object oriented programming"], "abstract": "The exceptionally large nature of multimedia content has motivated the creation of many different compression algorithms and encapsulation formats to make its transportation and storage feasible. Developers of multimedia applications have to deal repeatedly with the massive number of forms in which content is present, turning the single task of media access into an unnecessary challenge. The open source project FOBS provides a way to abstract developers from these difficulties, by offering an intuitive and powerful object oriented multimedia access API. FOBS has been conceived to be inherently platform independent and to be easily adaptable to multiple programming languages, making the addition of multimedia support possible in almost any application.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Sheffield"], "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 San Pedro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedro:Jos=eacute=_San"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
