Although this classifier was originally designed as offline learning algorithm, there has been an increased interest in the last years to provide an online variant. In this paper, we propose an online learning algorithm for classification trees that adheres to Bayesian principles. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that produce large forests with complex trees, we aim at constructing small ensembles consisting of shallow trees with high generalization capabilities. Experiments on benchmark machine learning and body part recognition datasets show superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["fondazione bruno kessler", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Samuel Rota Bul\u00f2.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bul=ograve=:Samuel_Rota", "Peter Kontschieder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontschieder:Peter"], "pages": 9}
