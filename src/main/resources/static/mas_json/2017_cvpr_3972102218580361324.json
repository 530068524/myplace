{"title": "Polyhedral Conic Classifiers for Visual Object Detection and Classification.", "fields": ["open set", "object detection", "support vector machine", "conic section", "binary number"], "abstract": "We propose a family of quasi-linear discriminants that outperform current large-margin methods in sliding window visual object detection and open set recognition tasks. In these tasks the classification problems are both numerically imbalanced \u2013 positive (object class) training and test windows are much rarer than negative (non-class) ones \u2013 and geometrically asymmetric \u2013 the positive samples typically form compact, visually-coherent groups while negatives are much more diverse, including anything at all that is not a well-centred sample from the target class. It is difficult to cover such negative classes using training samples, and doubly so in open set applications where run-time negatives may stem from classes that were not seen at all during training. So there is a need for discriminants whose decision regions focus on tightly circumscribing the positive class, while still taking account of negatives in zones where the two classes overlap. This paper introduces a family of quasi-linear polyhedral conic discriminants whose positive regions are distorted L1 balls. The methods have properties and run-time complexities comparable to linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and they can be trained from either binary or positive-only samples using constrained quadratic programs related to SVMs. Our experiments show that they significantly outperform both linear SVMs and existing one-class discriminants on a wide range of object detection, open set recognition and conventional closed-set classification tasks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Eski\u015fehir Osmangazi University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hakan Cevikalp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cevikalp:Hakan", "Bill Triggs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Triggs:Bill"], "pages": 9}
