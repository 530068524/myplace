Sieve algorithms are however outperformed by pruned enumeration algorithms in practice by several orders of magnitude, despite the larger super-exponential asymptotical complexity \\(2^{\\varTheta (n \\log n)}\\) of the latter.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["L\u00e9o Ducas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ducas:L=eacute=o"], "pages": 21}
