This facilitate the use of statistical techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), but is also known to require significant processing overhead. We seek to improve the quality of information extracted from the Monte Carlo playout in three ways. Firstly, by nesting the evaluation function inside another evaluation function; secondly, by measuring and utilising the depth of the playout; and thirdly, by incorporating pruning strategies that eliminate unnecessary searches and avoid traps. Our experimental data, obtained on a variety of two-player games from past General Game Playing (GGP) competitions and others, demonstrate the usefulness of these techniques in a Nested Player when pitted against a standard, optimised UCT player.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Tristan Cazenave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cazenave:Tristan", "Abdallah Saffidine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saffidine:Abdallah", "Michael John Schofield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schofield:Michael_John", "Michael Thielscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thielscher:Michael"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
