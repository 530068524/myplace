This provides finite systems of monotone transformations of the interval [0,1] with the expansion property. Combined with the approach from Dvir and Shpilka (2008), we obtain a solution to the \u201cdimension expander\u201d problem from Wigderson (2004). To cite this article: J. Bourgain, C. R. Acad. Sci.
