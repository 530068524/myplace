{"title": "Failure-Atomic Slotted Paging for Persistent Memory.", "fields": ["page replacement algorithm", "commit", "demand paging", "page fault", "transactional memory"], "abstract": "The slotted-page structure is a database page format commonly used for managing variable-length records. In this work, we develop a novel \"failure-atomic slotted page structure\" for persistent memory that leverages byte addressability and durability of persistent memory to minimize redundant write operations used to maintain consistency in traditional database systems. Failure-atomic slotted paging consists of two key elements: (i) in-place commit per page using hardware transactional memory and (ii) slot header logging that logs the commit mark of each page. The proposed scheme is implemented in SQLite and compared against NVWAL, the current state-of-the-art scheme. Our performance study shows that our failure-atomic slotted paging shows optimal performance for database transactions that insert a single record. For transactions that touch more than one database page, our proposed slot-header logging scheme minimizes the logging overhead by avoiding duplicating pages and logging only the metadata of the dirty pages. Overall, we find that our failure-atomic slotted-page management scheme reduces database logging overhead to 1/6 and improves query response time by up to 33% compared to NVWAL.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Jihye Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Jihye", "Wook-Hee Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Wook=Hee", "Woongki Baek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baek:Woongki", "Beomseok Nam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nam:Beomseok", "Sam H.
