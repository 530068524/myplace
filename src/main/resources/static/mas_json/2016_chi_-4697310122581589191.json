{"title": "What is Your Organization 'Like'?: A Study of Liking Activity in the Enterprise.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "social media", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "The 'like' button, introduced by Facebook several years ago, has become one of the most prominent icons of social media. Similarly to other popular social media features on the web, enterprises have also recently adopted it. In this paper, we present a first comprehensive study of liking activity in the enterprise. We studied the logs of an enterprise social media platform within a large global organization along a period of seven months, in which 393,720 'likes' were performed. In addition, we conducted a survey of 571 users of the platform's 'like' button. Our evaluation combines quantitative and qualitative analysis to inspect what employees like, why they use the 'like' button, and to whom they give their 'likes'.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "IBM", "IBM", "Yahoo!", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ido Guy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guy:Ido", "Inbal Ronen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ronen:Inbal", "Naama Zwerdling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwerdling:Naama", "Irena Grabovitch-Zuyev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grabovitch=Zuyev:Irena", "Michal Jacovi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacovi:Michal"], "pages": 13}
