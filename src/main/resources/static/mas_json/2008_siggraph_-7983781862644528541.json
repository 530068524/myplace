It is suitable for gesture input systems and aerial imaging systems because no physical contact is required to provide haptic feedback. An ultrasonic phased array generates a focal point of airborne ultrasound to press the skin surface. The amplitude modulation of ultrasound provides vibrotactile stimulation covering the entire frequency range of human tactile perception. The position of the focal point is computationally controlled to follow users\u2019 hands and/or provide a trajectory of stimulation. While this technology was originally invented as a tactile display, a wide variety of other applications has been recently reported that exploit noncontact force generated at a distance. Examples include noncontact measurement by pressing or vibrating objects, levitation and manipulation of small objects, and actuation of fragile or soft materials. The present chapter describes the background, principles, systems, and applications of this ultrasonic technology.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Takayuki Iwamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwamoto_0001:Takayuki", "Mari Tatezono.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tatezono:Mari", "Takayuki Hoshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoshi:Takayuki", "Hiroyuki Shinoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shinoda:Hiroyuki"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2008", "pages": 1}
