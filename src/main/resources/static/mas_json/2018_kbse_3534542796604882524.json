The objective of my thesis work is to propose a seamless approach, allowing users to express requirements, specifications and the system itself in a unique language.     The purpose of formal approaches is to reduce inconsistency. However, most developers are not familiar with these approaches, and they are not often used outside the critical systems domain. Since we want that non-experts can also use our approach to validate systems in the early stage of their development, we propose a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that is: (i) close to natural language, and (ii) based on a formal semantics. Using Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), this language bridges the gap not only between the several stakeholders that can be involved in a project, considering their different backgrounds, but also between the requirements and the code.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Toulouse"], "authors": ["Florian Galinier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galinier:Florian"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
