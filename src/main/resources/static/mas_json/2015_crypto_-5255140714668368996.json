{"title": "Tweaking Even-Mansour Ciphers.", "fields": ["ciphertext", "cipher", "block cipher", "random permutation", "iterated function"], "abstract": "We study how to construct efficient tweakable block ciphers in the Random Permutation model, where all parties have access to public random permutation oracles. We propose a construction that combines, more efficiently than by mere black-box composition, the CLRW construction (which turns a traditional block cipher into a tweakable block cipher) of Landecker et al. (CRYPTO 2012) and the iterated Even-Mansour construction (which turns a tuple of public permutations into a traditional block cipher) that has received considerable attention since the work of Bogdanov et al. (EUROCRYPT 2012). More concretely, we introduce the (one-round) tweakable Even-Mansour (TEM) cipher, constructed from a single n-bit permutation P and a uniform and almost XOR-universal family of hash functions \\((H_k)\\) from some tweak space to \\(\\{0,1\\}^n\\), and defined as \\((k,t,x)\\mapsto H_k(t)\\oplus P(H_k(t)\\oplus x)\\), where k is the key, t is the tweak, and x is the n-bit message, as well as its generalization obtained by cascading r independently keyed rounds of this construction. Our main result is a security bound up to approximately \\(2^{2n/3}\\) adversarial queries against adaptive chosen-plaintext and ciphertext distinguishers for the two-round TEM construction, using Patarin\u2019s H-coefficients technique. We also provide an analysis based on the coupling technique showing that asymptotically, as the number of rounds r grows, the security provided by the r-round TEM construction approaches the information-theoretic bound of \\(2^n\\) adversarial queries.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Versailles", "University of Versailles", "ANSSI"], "authors": ["Benoit Cogliati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cogliati:Benoit", "Rodolphe Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Rodolphe", "Yannick Seurin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seurin:Yannick"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
