{"title": "A New String-to-Dependency Machine Translation Algorithm with a Target Dependency Language Model.", "fields": ["transfer based machine translation", "bleu", "machine translation software usability", "evaluation of machine translation", "cache language model"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel string-todependency algorithm for statistical machine translation. With this new framework, we employ a target dependency language model during decoding to exploit long distance word relations, which are unavailable with a traditional n-gram language model. Our experiments show that the string-to-dependency decoder achieves 1.48 point improvement in BLEU and 2.53 point improvement in TER compared to a standard hierarchical string-tostring system on the NIST 04 Chinese-English evaluation set.", "citation": "Citations (281)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Libin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Libin", "Jinxi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jinxi", "Ralph M.
