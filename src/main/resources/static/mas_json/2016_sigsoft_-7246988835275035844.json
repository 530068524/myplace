{"title": "Field-exhaustive testing.", "fields": ["implementation", "bounded function", "code refactoring", "code coverage", "data domain"], "abstract": "We present a testing approach for object oriented programs, which encompasses a testing criterion and an automated test generation technique. The criterion, that we call  field-exhaustive testing , requires a user-provided limit  n  on the size of data domains, and is based on the idea of considering enough inputs so as to exhaustively cover the  extension  of class fields, within the limit  n . Intuitively, the extension of a field  f  is the binary relation established between objects and their corresponding values for field  f , in valid instances. Thus, a suite  S  is field-exhaustive if whenever a field  f  relates an object  o  with a value  v  (i.e.,  o . f  =  v ) within a valid instance  I  of size bounded by  n , then  S  contains at least one input  I \u00e2 \ufffd covering such relationship, i.e.,  o  must also be part of  I \u00e2 \ufffd, and  o . f  =  v  must hold in  I \u00e2 \ufffd. Our test generation technique uses incremental SAT solving to produce  small  field-exhaustive suites: field-exhaustiveness can be achieved with a suite containing at most #  F  \ufffd   n  2  inputs, where #  F  is the number of fields in the class under test.   We perform an experimental evaluation on two different testing domains drawn from the literature: implementations of data structures, and of a refactoring engine. The experiments show that field-exhaustive suites can be computed efficiently, and retain similar levels of code coverage and mutation killing as significantly larger bounded exhaustive and random suites, thus consuming a fraction of the cost of test execution compared to these automated testing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National University of R\u00edo Cuarto", "National University of R\u00edo Cuarto", "Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Buenos Aires", "Stellenbosch University"], "authors": ["Pablo Ponzio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponzio:Pablo", "Nazareno Aguirre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aguirre:Nazareno", "Marcelo F.
