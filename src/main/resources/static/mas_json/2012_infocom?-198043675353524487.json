We consider MotionCast in an extended cell partitioned network under a Markovian node mobility model and exactly compute the pernode throughput capacity. A Two hop relay algorithm is proposed to guarantee such capacity, which also achieves a better delay-capacity tradeoff, i.e., \u0398(N log k). Considering that redundancy can significantly improve network delay, we present a Two hop relay algorithm with redundancy and study the general influence of redundancy on the capacity and delay of MotionCast network. Moreover, we use the minimum energy function to characterize the energy consumption for the MotionCast network. An accurate piecewise minimum energy function to keep network stable is derived. Furthermore, a simple Minimum energy algorithm is designed, which reduces actual energy consumption arbitrarily close to the minimum energy function at the cost of increasing delay. Our result shows that the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal energy-delay tradeoff.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Shangxing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shangxing", "Youyun Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Youyun", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
