{"title": "On Context-Dependent Clustering of Bandits.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "interleaving", "inference", "regret", "expected value"], "abstract": "We investigate a novel cluster-of-bandit algorithm CAB for collaborative recommendation tasks that implements the underlying feedback sharing mechanism by estimating the neighborhood of users in a context-dependent manner. CAB makes sharp departures from the state of the art by incorporating collaborative effects into inference as well as learning processes in a manner that seamlessly interleaving explore-exploit tradeoffs and collaborative steps. We prove regret bounds under various assumptions on the data, which exhibit a crisp dependence on the expected number of clusters over the users, a natural measure of the statistical difficulty of the learning task. Experiments on production and real-world datasets show that CAB offers significantly increased prediction performance against a representative pool of state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Milan", "University of Insubria", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Amazon.com"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Claudio Gentile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentile:Claudio", "Shuai Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shuai", "Purushottam Kar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kar:Purushottam", "Alexandros Karatzoglou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karatzoglou:Alexandros", "Giovanni Zappella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zappella:Giovanni", "Evans Etrue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etrue:Evans"], "pages": 10}
