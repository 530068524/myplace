{"title": "Convergence of Local Dynamics to Balanced Outcomes in Exchange Networks.", "fields": ["data structure", "dynamic priority scheduling", "resource management", "game theory", "science communication"], "abstract": "Bargaining games on exchange networks have been studied by both economists and sociologists. A Balanced Outcome for such a game is an equilibrium concept that combines notions of stability and fairness. In a recent paper, Kleinberg and Tardos introduced balanced outcomes to the computer science community and provided a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the set of such outcomes. Their work left open a pertinent question: are there natural, local dynamics that converge quickly to a balanced outcome? In this paper, we provide a partial answer to this question by showing that simple edge-balancing dynamics converge to a balanced outcome whenever one exists.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yossi Azar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azar:Yossi", "Benjamin E.
