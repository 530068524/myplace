Using test-level satisfaction ratings instead of task-level ratings attenuated the correlations (r between .16 and .24). The method of aggregating data from a usability test had a significant effect on the magnitude of the resulting correlations. The results of principal components and factor analyses on the prototypical usability metrics provided evidence for an underlying construct of general usability with objective and subjective factors.", "citation": "Citations (129)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jeff Sauro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sauro:Jeff", "James R.
