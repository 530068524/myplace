Depending on the chosen set of forcing conditions, the resulting type theory can be extended with extra logical principles. The translation is proven correct---in the sense that it preserves type checking---and has been implemented in Coq. As a case study, we show how the forcing translation on integers (which corresponds to the internalization of the topos of trees) allows us to define general inductive types in Coq, without the strict positivity condition. Using such general inductive types, we can construct a shallow embedding of the pure lambda-calculus in Coq, without defining an axiom on the existence of an universal domain. We also build another forcing layer where we prove the negation of the continuum hypothesis.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole des mines de Nantes", "\u00c9cole des mines de Nantes", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Guilhem Jaber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaber:Guilhem", "Nicolas Tabareau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tabareau:Nicolas", "Matthieu Sozeau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sozeau:Matthieu"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
