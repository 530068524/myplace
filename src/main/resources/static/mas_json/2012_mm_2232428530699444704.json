{"title": "Controlling urban lighting by human motion patterns results from a full scale experiment.", "fields": ["software", "full scale", "rgb color model", "meter", "led lamp"], "abstract": "This paper presents a full-scale experiment investigating the use of human motion intensities as input for interactive illumination of a town square in the city of Aalborg in Denmark. As illuminators sixteen 3.5 meter high RGB LED lamps were used. The activity on the square was monitored by three thermal cameras and analysed by computer vision software from which motion intensity maps and peoples trajectories were estimated and used as input to control the interactive illumination. The paper introduces a 2-layered interactive light strategy addressing ambient and effect illumination criteria totally four light scenarios were designed and tested. The result shows that in general people immersed in the street lighting did not notice that the light changed according to their presence or actions, but people watching from the edge of the square noticed the interaction between the illumination and the immersed persons. The experiment also demonstrated that interactive can give significant power savings. In the current experiment there was a difference of 92% between the most and less energy consuming light scenario.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University"], "authors": ["Esben Skouboe Poulsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poulsen:Esben_Skouboe", "Hans J\u00f8rgen Andersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andersen:Hans_J=oslash=rgen", "Ole B.
