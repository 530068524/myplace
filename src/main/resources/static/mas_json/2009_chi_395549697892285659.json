{"title": "The design and evaluation of multi-finger mouse emulation techniques.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "computer science", "emulation", "simulation"], "abstract": "We explore the use of multi-finger input to emulate full mouse functionality, such as the tracking state, three buttons, and chording. We first present the design space for such techniques, which serves as a guide for the systematic investigation of possible solutions. We then perform a series of pilot studies to come up with recommendations for the various aspects of the design space. These pilot studies allow us to arrive at a recommended technique, the SDMouse. In a formal study, the SDMouse was shown to significantly improve performance in comparison to previously developed mouse emulation techniques.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Autodesk", "Autodesk", "Autodesk", "Autodesk"], "authors": ["Justin Matejka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matejka:Justin", "Tovi Grossman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossman:Tovi", "Jessica Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo:Jessica", "George W.
