The issue of confidence bands for the ROC curve is considered and a resampling procedure based on a smooth version of the empirical distribution called the \"smoothed bootstrap\" is introduced. Theoretical arguments and simulation results are presented to show that the \"smoothed bootstrap\" is preferable to a \"naive\" bootstrap in order to construct accurate confidence bands.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Patrice Bertail.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertail:Patrice", "St\u00e9phan Cl\u00e9men\u00e7on.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cl=eacute=men=ccedil=on:St=eacute=phan", "Nicolas Vayatis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vayatis:Nicolas"], "pages": 8}
