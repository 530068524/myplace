We also show, using the same technique, that any boolean formula of size O(n 1.999 ) over the complete basis, agrees with h on at most 1/2 + e fraction of the inputs, where e is exponentially small (i.e. e = 2 -n \u03a9(1)  ). Our construction is based on Andreev's \u03a9(n 2.5-o(1) ) formula size lower bound that was proved for the case of exact computation.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ilan Komargodski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komargodski:Ilan", "Ran Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Ran"], "pages": 10}
