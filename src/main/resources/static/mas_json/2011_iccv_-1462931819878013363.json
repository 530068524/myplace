{"title": "Modeling temporal coherence for optical flow.", "fields": ["optical flow", "trajectory", "coherence", "smoothness", "computation"], "abstract": "Despite the fact that temporal coherence is undeniably one of the key aspects when processing video data, this concept has hardly been exploited in recent optical flow methods. In this paper, we will present a novel parametrization for multi-frame optical flow computation that naturally enables us to embed the assumption of a temporally coherent spatial flow structure, as well as the assumption that the optical flow is smooth along motion trajectories. While the first assumption is realized by expanding spatial regularization over multiple frames, the second assumption is imposed by two novel first- and second-order trajectorial smoothness terms. With respect to the latter, we investigate an adaptive decision scheme that makes a local (per pixel) or global (per sequence) selection of the most appropriate model possible. Experiments show the clear superiority of our approach when compared to existing strategies for imposing temporal coherence. Moreover, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method by achieving Top 3 results at the widely used Middlebury benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (103)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Sebastian Volz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Volz:Sebastian", "Andr\u00e9s Bruhn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruhn:Andr=eacute=s", "Levi Valgaerts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valgaerts:Levi", "Henning Zimmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmer:Henning"], "pages": 8}
