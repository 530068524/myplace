{"title": "Information Set Generation in Partially Observable Games.", "fields": ["combinatorial game theory", "information set", "deliberation", "sequential game", "observable"], "abstract": "We address the problem of making single-point decisions in large partially observable games, where players interleave observation, deliberation, and action. We present information set generation as a key operation needed to reason about games in this way. We show how this operation can be used to implement an existing decision-making algorithm. We develop a constraint satisfaction algorithm for performing information set generation and show that it scales better than the existing depth-first search approach on multiple non-trivial games.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Mark Richards.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Richards:Mark", "Eyal Amir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amir:Eyal"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
