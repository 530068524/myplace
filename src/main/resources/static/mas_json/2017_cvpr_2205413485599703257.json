However, typical GAN-based approaches require large amounts of training data to capture the diversity across the image modality. In this paper, we propose DeLiGAN \u2013 a novel GAN-based architecture for diverse and limited training data scenarios. In our approach, we reparameterize the latent generative space as a mixture model and learn the mixture models parameters along with those of GAN. This seemingly simple modification to the GAN framework is surprisingly effective and results in models which enable diversity in generated samples although trained with limited data. In our work, we show that DeLiGAN can generate images of handwritten digits, objects and hand-drawn sketches, all using limited amounts of data. To quantitatively characterize intra-class diversity of generated samples, we also introduce a modified version of inception-score, a measure which has been found to correlate well with human assessment of generated samples.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Swaminathan Gurumurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurumurthy:Swaminathan", "Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarvadevabhatla:Ravi_Kiran", "R.
