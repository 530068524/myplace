{"title": "A predictable synchronisation algorithm.", "fields": ["latency", "critical section", "predictability", "asynchronous communication", "concurrent data structure"], "abstract": "Interaction with physical objects often imposes  latency  requirements to multi-core embedded systems. One consequence is the need for synchronisation algorithms that provide predictable latency, in addition to high throughput. We present a synchronisation algorithm that needs at most 7 atomic memory operations per  asynchronous critical section.  The performance is competitive, at least, to locks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Stefan Reif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reif:Stefan", "Wolfgang Schr\u00f6der-Preikschat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schr=ouml=der=Preikschat:Wolfgang"], "pages": 2}
