A consequence is that we match or improve the best known c vs. s NP-hardness result for Unique-Games for all values of c (except for c very close to 0). For these c, ours is the first hardness result showing that it helps to take the alphabet size larger than 2. Our NP-hardness reductions are quasilinear-size and thus show nearly full exponential time is required, assuming the ETH.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ryan O'Donnell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Donnell:Ryan", "John Wright.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wright:John"], "pages": 18}
