Unlike previous methods based on natural gradients, our algorithm calculates the natural policy gradient using the inverse of the exact Fisher information matrix. The computational cost of this algorithm is equal to that of conventional policy gradients whereas previous natural policy gradient methods have a prohibitive computational cost. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several policy gradient methods.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Japan Society for the Promotion of Science", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Atsushi Miyamae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miyamae:Atsushi", "Yuichi Nagata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagata:Yuichi", "Isao Ono.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ono:Isao", "Shigenobu Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Shigenobu"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
