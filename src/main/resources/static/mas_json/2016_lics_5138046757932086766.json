Is it possible to prove it using the lambda-calculus instead of Turing machines? We address this question via the notion of affine approximation, which offers the possibility of using order-theoretic arguments, in contrast to the machine-level arguments employed in standard proofs. However, due to the size explosion problem in the lambda-calculus (a linear number of reduction steps may generate exponentially big terms), a naive transliteration of the proof of the Cook-Levin theorem fails. We propose to fix this mismatch using the author's recently introduced parsimonious lambda-calculus, reproving the Cook-Levin theorem and several related results in this higher-order framework. We also present an interesting relationship between approximations and intersection types, and discuss potential applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Paris-Sorbonne University"], "authors": ["Damiano Mazza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazza:Damiano"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
