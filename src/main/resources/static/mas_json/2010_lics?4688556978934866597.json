In this paper, we present a novel cut elimination procedure for classical propositional logic. It is based on the recently introduced `atomic flows': they are purely graphical devices that abstract away from much of the typical bureaucracy of proofs. We make crucial use of the `path breaker', an atomic flow construction that avoids some nasty termination problems, and that can be used in any proof system with sufficient symmetry. This paper contains an original 2-dimensional-diagram exposition of atomic flows, which helps us to connect atomic flows with other known formalisms.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Bath", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Alessio Guglielmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guglielmi:Alessio", "Tom Gundersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gundersen:Tom", "Lutz Stra\u00dfburger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stra=szlig=burger:Lutz"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
