{"title": "Specification Inference Using Context-Free Language Reachability.", "fields": ["context free language", "android", "small number", "taint checking", "reachability"], "abstract": "We present a framework for computing context-free language reachability properties when parts of the program are missing. Our framework infers candidate specifications for missing program pieces that are needed for verifying a property of interest, and presents these specifications to a human auditor for validation. We have implemented this framework for a taint analysis of Android apps that relies on specifications for Android library methods. In an extensive experimental study on 179 apps, our tool performs verification with only a small number of queries to a human auditor.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Osbert Bastani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bastani:Osbert", "Saswat Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Saswat", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2015", "pages": 14}
