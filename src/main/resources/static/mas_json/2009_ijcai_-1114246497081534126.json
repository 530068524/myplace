We propose such a language, taking inspiration from previous work on graphical languages for preference representation, specifically CP-nets, and introduce conditional importance networks (CI-nets). A CI-net includes statements of the form \"if I have a set A of goods, and I do not have any of the goods from some other set B, then I prefer the set of goods C over the set of goods D.\" We investigate expressivity and complexity issues for CI-nets. Then we show that CI-nets are well-suited to the description of fair division problems.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "Paris Dauphine University", "ONERA, DTIM, Toulouse, France"], "authors": ["Sylvain Bouveret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouveret:Sylvain", "Ulle Endriss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Endriss:Ulle", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
