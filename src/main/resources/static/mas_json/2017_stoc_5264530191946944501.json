Specifically, for every  n ,  d  =  n   o (1) , and every  d -dimensional symmetric norm ||\ufffd\u00b7||, there exists a data structure for (loglog n )-approximate nearest neighbor search over ||\ufffd\u00b7|| for  n -point datasets achieving  n   o (1)  query time and  n  1+ o (1)  space. The main technical ingredient of the algorithm is a low-distortion embedding of a\ufffd symmetric norm into a low-dimensional iterated product of top- k  norms.   We also show that our techniques cannot be extended to *general* norms.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Northeastern University", "University of Toronto", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Alexandr Andoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andoni:Alexandr", "Huy L.
