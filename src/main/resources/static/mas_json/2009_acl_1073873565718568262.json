This has resulted in the growth of SMS based Question Answering (QA) services. However automatically handling SMS questions poses significant challenges due to the inherent noise in SMS questions. In this work we present an automatic FAQ-based question answering system for SMS users. We handle the noise in a SMS query by formulating the query similarity over FAQ questions as a combinatorial search problem. The search space consists of combinations of all possible dictionary variations of tokens in the noisy query. We present an efficient search algorithm that does not require any training data or SMS normalization and can handle semantic variations in question formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two reallife datasets.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Govind Kothari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kothari:Govind", "Sumit Negi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Negi:Sumit", "Tanveer A.
