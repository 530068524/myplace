{"title": "Improved Distance Sensitivity Oracles via Fast Single-Source Replacement Paths.", "fields": ["oracle", "integer", "matrix multiplication", "omega", "directed graph"], "abstract": "A distance sensitivity oracle is a data structure which, given two nodes s and t in a directed edge-weighted graph G and an edge e, returns the shortest length of an s-t path not containing e, a so called replacement path for the triple (s, t, e). Such oracles are used to quickly recover from edge failures. In this paper we consider the case of integer weights in the interval [-M, M], and present the first distance sensitivity oracle that achieves simultaneously sub cubic preprocessing time and sub linear query time. More precisely, for a given parameter \\alpha\\in [0, 1], our oracle has preprocessing time \\tilde{O}(Mn^{\\omega+\\frac{1}{2}}+Mn^{\\omega+\\alpha(4-\\omega)}) and query time \\tilde{O}(n^{1-\\alpha}).
