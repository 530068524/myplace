In particular, we consider the square loss and show that for a universal step-size choice, the number of passes acts as a regularization parameter, and optimal finite sample bounds can be achieved by early-stopping. Moreover, we show that larger step-sizes are allowed when considering mini-batches. Our analysis is based on a unifying approach, encompassing both batch and stochastic gradient methods as special cases.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Junhong Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Junhong", "Lorenzo Rosasco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosasco:Lorenzo"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
