{"title": "Determining Expert Research Areas with Multi-Instance Learning of Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification Model.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "multi label classification", "categorization", "data mining", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Automatically identifying the research areas of academic/ industry researchers is an important task for building expertise organizations or search systems. In general, this task can be viewed as text classification that generates a set of research areas given the expertise of a researcher like documents of publications. However, this task is challenging because the evidence of a research area may only exist in a few documents instead of all documents. Moreover, the research areas are often organized in a hierarchy, which limits the effectiveness of existing text categorization methods. This paper proposes a novel approach, Multi-instance Learning of Hierarchical Multi-label Classification Model (MIHML) for the task, which effectively identifies multiple research areas in a hierarchy from individual documents within the profile of a researcher. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization algorithm is designed to learn the model parameters. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of proposed research with a real world application.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Tao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Tao", "Qifan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qifan", "Zhiwei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhiwei", "Luo Si.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Si:Luo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
