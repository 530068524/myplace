Test suite parallelization is an important approach to address this problem. This paper reports our findings on the usage and impact of test suite parallelization in open-source projects. It provides recommendations to practitioners and tool developers to speed up test execution. Considering a set of 468 popular Java projects we analyzed, we found that 24% of the projects contain costly test suites but parallelization features still seem underutilized in practice \u2014 only 19.1% of costly projects use parallelization. The main reported reason for adoption resistance was the concern to deal with concurrency issues. Results suggest that, on average, developers prefer high predictability than high performance in running tests.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Federal University of Pernambuco", "Federal University of Pernambuco", "Federal University of Pernambuco"], "authors": ["Jeanderson Candido.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Candido:Jeanderson", "Luis Melo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melo:Luis", "Marcelo d'Amorim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/d=Amorim:Marcelo"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
