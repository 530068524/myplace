{"title": "A shape-free, designable 6-DoF marker tracking method for camera-based interaction in mobile environment.", "fields": ["visual communication", "augmented reality", "adjacency list", "mobile device", "hash table"], "abstract": "We developed a novel marker tracking method with shape-free designable markers, which can be visually meaningful to users. The method can work fast enough to provide a real-time camerabased interaction even on low performance CPUs such as one used in mobile Internet devices. Features such as visually communicative design and inexpensive computational cost are very desirable for users with mobile devices in the mobile/pervasive interaction environment. The method utilizes the topological region adjacency to detect the marker candidates and then apply a simple method similar to geometric-hashing to determine the detected maker by voting to the hash tables. By such a combination of two different approaches, our method can distinguish those markers with the same topological structure and is also capable of 6-DoF post estimation whereas most of the existing topology-based systems can not distinguish markers with the same topological.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Hiroki Nishino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishino:Hiroki"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
