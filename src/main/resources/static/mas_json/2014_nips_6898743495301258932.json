The Dirichlet process max-margin Gaussian mixture is a nonparametric Bayesian clustering model that relaxes the underlying Gaussian assumption of Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures by incorporating max-margin posterior constraints, and is able to infer the number of clusters from data. We further extend the ideas to present max-margin clustering topic model, which can learn the latent topic representation of each document while at the same time cluster documents in the max-margin fashion. Extensive experiments are performed on a number of real datasets, and the results indicate superior clustering performance of our methods compared to related baselines.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Duke University", "Tsinghua University", "Australian National University", "Duke University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Changyou Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Changyou", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Xinhua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinhua"], "pages": 9}
