Existing domain adversarial adaptation methods based on single domain discriminator only align the source and target data distributions without exploiting the complex multimode structures. In this paper, we present a multi-adversarial domain adaptation (MADA) approach, which captures multimode structures to enable fine-grained alignment of different data distributions based on multiple domain discriminators. The adaptation can be achieved by stochastic gradient descent with the gradients computed by back-propagation in linear-time. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms state of the art methods on standard domain adaptation datasets.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Zhongyi Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Zhongyi", "Zhangjie Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Zhangjie", "Mingsheng Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Mingsheng", "Jianmin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Jianmin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
