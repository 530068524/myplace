{"title": "Identifying message flow in distributed event-based systems.", "fields": ["real time computing", "program analysis", "distributed computing", "middleware", "static analysis"], "abstract": "Distributed event-based (DEB) systems contain highly-decoupled components that interact by exchanging messages. This enables flexible system composition and adaptation, but also makes DEB systems difficult to maintain. Most existing program analysis techniques to support maintenance are not well suited to DEB systems, while those that are tend to suffer from inaccuracy or make assumptions that limit their applicability. This paper presents Eos, a static analysis technique that identifies message information useful for maintaining a DEB system, namely, message types and message flow within a system. Eos has been evaluated on six off-the-shelf DEB systems spanning five different middleware platforms, and has exhibited excellent accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, a case study involving a range of maintenance activities undertaken on three existing DEB systems shows that, on average, Eos enables an engineer to identify the scope and impact of required changes more accurately than existing alternatives.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Joshua Garcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia:Joshua", "Daniel Popescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popescu_0001:Daniel", "Gholamreza Safi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Safi:Gholamreza", "William G.
