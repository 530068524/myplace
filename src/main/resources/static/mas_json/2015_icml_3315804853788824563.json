{"title": "Removing systematic errors for exoplanet search via latent causes.", "fields": ["systematic error", "confounding", "exoplanet", "causal inference", "econometrics"], "abstract": "We describe a method for removing the effect of confounders in order to reconstruct a latent quantity of interest. The method, referred to as halfsibling regression, is inspired by recent work in causal inference using additive noise models. We provide a theoretical justification and illustrate the potential of the method in a challenging astronomy application.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard", "David W.
