Besides outlining DP based solutions to the multiple alignment problem, we detail an approximation of the problem in terms of multiple sequence segmentations satisfying a coupling constraint. We apply our approach to boosting baseline G2P systems using homogeneous as well as heterogeneous sources of supplemental information.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Goethe University Frankfurt"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Steffen Eger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eger:Steffen"], "pages": 11}
