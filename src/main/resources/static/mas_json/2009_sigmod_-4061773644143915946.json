{"title": "DejaVu: declarative pattern matching over live and archived streams of events.", "fields": ["interactive visualization", "systems architecture", "query language", "complex event processing", "data stream mining"], "abstract": "DejaVu is an event processing system that integrates declarative pattern matching over live and archived streams of events on top of a novel system architecture. We propose to demonstrate the key aspects of the DejaVu query language and architecture using two different application scenarios, namely a smart RFID library system and a financial market data analysis application. The demonstration will illustrate how DejaVu can uniformly handle one-time, continuous, and hybrid pattern matching queries over live and archived stream stores, using highly interactive visual monitoring tools including one that is based on the Second Life virtual world.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Nihal Dindar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dindar:Nihal", "Baris G\u00fc\u00e7.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=uuml==ccedil=:Baris", "Patrick Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Patrick", "Asli \u00d6zal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ouml=zal:Asli", "Merve Soner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soner:Merve", "Nesime Tatbul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tatbul:Nesime"], "pages": 4}
