We show that the weighted trace-norm regularization indeed yields significant gains on the highly non-uniformly sampled Netflix dataset.", "citation": "Citations (161)", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "authors": ["Ruslan Salakhutdinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salakhutdinov:Ruslan", "Nathan Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nathan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
