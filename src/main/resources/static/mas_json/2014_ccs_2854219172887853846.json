Are some geographic regions more vulnerable than others? Do practical countermeasures exist? To answer these questions, we introduce the notion of the routing bottlenecks and show that it is a fundamental property of Internet design; i.e., it is a consequence of route-cost minimizations. We illustrate the pervasiveness of routing bottlenecks in an experiment comprising 15 countries and 15 cities distributed around the world, and measure their susceptibility to scalable link-flooding attacks. We present the key characteristics of routing bottlenecks, including size, link type, and distance from host destinations, and suggest specific structural and operational countermeasures to link-flooding attacks. These countermeasures can be deployed by network operators without needing major Internet redesign.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Min Suk Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Min_Suk", "Virgil D.
