{"title": "Decidability, complexity, and expressiveness of first-order logic over the subword ordering.", "fields": ["bounded function", "undecidable problem", "expressivity", "alternation", "decidability"], "abstract": "We consider first-order logic over the subword ordering on finite words where each word is available as a constant. Our first result is that the \u03a3 1  theory is undecidable (already over two letters). We investigate the decidability border by considering fragments where all but a certain number of variables are alternation bounded, meaning that the variable must always be quantified over languages with a bounded number of letter alternations. We prove that when at most two variables are not alternation bounded, the \u03a3 1  fragment is decidable, and that it becomes undecidable when three variables are not alternation bounded. Regarding higher quantifier alternation depths, we prove that the \u03a3 2  fragment is undecidable already for one variable without alternation bound and that when all variables are alternation bounded, the entire first-order theory is decidable.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Simon Halfon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halfon:Simon", "Philippe Schnoebelen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schnoebelen:Philippe", "Georg Zetzsche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zetzsche:Georg"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
