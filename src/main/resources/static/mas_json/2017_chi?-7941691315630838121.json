{"title": "HCI and Environmental Public Policy: Opportunities for Engagement.", "fields": ["procurement", "government", "green computing", "christian ministry", "policy studies"], "abstract": "This note discusses opportunities for the HCI community to engage with environmental public policy. It draws on insights and observations made during the primary author's recent work for a policy unit at Global Affairs Canada, which is a federal ministry of the Government of Canada. During that work, the primary author identified several domains of environmental public policy that are of direct relevance to the HCI community. This note contributes a preliminary discussion of how, why, with whom, and in what capacity HCI researchers and practitioners might engage with three types of environmental public policy: climate change, waste electrical and electronic equipment, and green ICT procurement policies. This builds on existing public policy and environmental knowledge within the HCI community and responds directly to calls from some members to engage with environmental public policy.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "University of Zurich", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Vanessa Thomas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomas:Vanessa", "Christian Remy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Remy_0001:Christian", "Mike Hazas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazas:Mike", "Oliver Bates.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bates:Oliver"], "pages": 7}
