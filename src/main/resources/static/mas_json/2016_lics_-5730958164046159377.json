{"title": "Healthiness from Duality.", "fields": ["monad", "intrinsic value", "predicate", "nondeterministic algorithm", "adjunction"], "abstract": "Healthiness is a good old question in program logics that dates back to Dijkstra. It asks for an intrinsic characterization of those predicate transformers which arise as the (backward) interpretation of a certain class of programs. There are several results known for healthiness conditions: for deterministic programs, nondeterministic ones, probabilistic ones, etc. Building upon our previous works on so-called state-and-effect triangles, we contribute a unified categorical framework for investigating healthiness conditions. This framework is based on a dual adjunction induced by a dualizing object and on our notion of relative Eilenberg-Moore algebra. The latter notion seems interesting in its own right in the context of monads, Lawvere theories and enriched categories.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "authors": ["Wataru Hino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hino:Wataru", "Hiroki Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Hiroki", "Ichiro Hasuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasuo:Ichiro", "Bart Jacobs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobs_0001:Bart"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
