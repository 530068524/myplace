Whilst the performance of model-free trackers has recently improved significantly, simultaneously tracking multiple objects with similar appearance remains very hard. In this paper, we propose a new multi-object model-free tracker (based on tracking-by-detection) that resolves this problem by incorporating spatial constraints between the objects. The spatial constraints are learned along with the object detectors using an online structured SVM algorithm. The experimental evaluation of our structure-preserving object tracker (SPOT) reveals significant performance improvements in multi-object tracking. We also show that SPOT can improve the performance of single-object trackers by simultaneously tracking different parts of the object.", "citation": "Citations (164)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Lu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0036:Lu", "Laurens van der Maaten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maaten:Laurens_van_der"], "pages": 8}
