Context awareness requires context monitoring and system adaptation, these two tasks are very expensive especially in mobile applications. Our research aims at developing a methodology that enables effective context awareness techniques for mobile applications that allows adaptations of the mobile app to context changes so that the desired system quality properties and user satisfaction is maximized. Here effective means selecting a minimum set of context variables to monitor and a minimum set of adaptive tactics to inject into mobile applications that allows to guarantee the required software quality and to maximize the user satisfaction. In this paper, we show the devised methodology on a motivating example, detailing the ongoing work.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of L&#039"], "authors": ["Mai Abusair.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abusair:Mai"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
