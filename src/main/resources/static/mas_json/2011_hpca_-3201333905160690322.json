{"title": "Addressing system-level trimming issues in on-chip nanophotonic networks.", "fields": ["sliding window protocol", "trimming", "resonator", "electric heating", "network on a chip"], "abstract": "The basic building block of on-chip nanophotonic interconnects is the microring resonator [14], and these resonators change their resonant wavelengths due to variations in temperature \u2014 a problem that can be addressed using a technique called \u201dtrimming\u201d, which involves correcting the drift via heating and/or current injection. Thus far system researchers have modeled trimming as a per ring fixed cost. In this work we show that at the system level using a fixed cost model is inappropriate \u2014 our simulations demonstrate that the cost of heating has a non-linear relationship with the number of rings, and also that current injection can lead to thermal runaway. We show that a very narrow Temperature Control Window (TCW) must be maintained in order for the network to work as desired. However, by exploiting the group drift property of co-located rings, it is possible to create a sliding window scheme which can increase the TCW. We also show that partially athermal rings can alleviate but not eliminate the problem.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Christopher Nitta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nitta:Christopher", "Matthew K.
