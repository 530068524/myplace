This is a very expressive class of automata, whose transitions may involve state and top-of-stack clocks with unbounded differences. It strictly subsumes pushdown timed automata of Bouajjani et al., dense-timed pushdown automata of Abdulla et al., and orbit-finite timed register pushdown automata of Clemente and Lasota. Along the way, we prove two further decidability results of independent interest: for non-emptiness of least solutions to systems of equations over sets of integers with addition, union and intersections with \u2115 and \u2212\u2115, and for reachability in one-dimensional branching vector addition systems with states and subtraction, both in exponential time.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warwick", "University of Warwick"], "authors": ["Lorenzo Clemente.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clemente:Lorenzo", "Slawomir Lasota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lasota:Slawomir", "Ranko Lazic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazic:Ranko", "Filip Mazowiecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazowiecki:Filip"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
