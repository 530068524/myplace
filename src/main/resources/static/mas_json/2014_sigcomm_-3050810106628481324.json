Unfortunately, currently proposed solutions either fall short of addressing important security concerns or require a substantial amount of router overhead. In this paper, we propose lightweight, scalable, and secure protocols for shared key setup, source authentication, and path validation. Our prototype implementation demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of the protocols, especially for software-based implementations.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "ETH Zurich", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Qualcomm", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Tiffany Hyun-Jin Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Tiffany_Hyun=Jin", "Cristina Basescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basescu:Cristina", "Limin Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Limin", "Soo Bum Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Soo_Bum", "Yih-Chun Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yih=Chun", "Adrian Perrig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perrig:Adrian"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
