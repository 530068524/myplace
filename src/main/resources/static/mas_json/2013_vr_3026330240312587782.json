However, current techniques may not be particularly useful in combination with head-mounted displays since many users unintentionally move forward while walking in place. We refer to this phenomenon accidental movement as Unintended Positional Drift. The poster presents evidence of the phenomenon's existence and subsequently discusses different design solutions which potentially could circumvent the problem.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen", "Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen", "Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Niels C.
