They are tree-structured classifiers with the ability to access intermediate prediction (here: classification and regression) information during training and inference time. This intermediate prediction is available for each sample and allows us to develop context-based decision criteria, used for refining the prediction process. In addition, we introduce a novel split criterion which in combination with a priority based way of constructing the trees, allows more accurate regression mode selection and hence improves the current context information. In our experiments, we demonstrate improved results for the task of pedestrian detection on the challenging TUD data set when compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Ca' Foscari University of Venice", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Ca' Foscari University of Venice"], "authors": ["Peter Kontschieder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontschieder:Peter", "Samuel Rota Bul\u00f2.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bul=ograve=:Samuel_Rota", "Antonio Criminisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Criminisi:Antonio", "Pushmeet Kohli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohli:Pushmeet", "Marcello Pelillo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pelillo:Marcello", "Horst Bischof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischof:Horst"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
