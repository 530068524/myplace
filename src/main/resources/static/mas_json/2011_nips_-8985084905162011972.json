Previous efficient algorithms could only learn to accuracy e in the presence of malicious noise of rate at most \u0398(e\u03b3).\n\nOur algorithm does not work by optimizing a convex loss function. We show that no algorithm for learning \u03b3-margin halfspaces that minimizes a convex proxy for misclassification error can tolerate malicious noise at a rate greater than \u0398(e\u03b3); this may partially explain why previous algorithms could not achieve the higher noise tolerance of our new algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Google", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Philip M.
