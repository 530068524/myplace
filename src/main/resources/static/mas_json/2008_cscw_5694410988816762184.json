We investigate the association between egocentric network properties (structure, position and tie) and information and communication technology (ICT) use of individuals in knowledge-intensive and geographically dispersed settings. Analysis from data collected using a reliable and validated questionnaire show that task-level ICT use is significantly associated with degree centrality and functional tie-diversity; and communication-level ICT use is negatively associated with efficiency. Implications of these associations for knowledge-intensive work are discussed in conclusion.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "University of Sydney"], "authors": ["Kon Shing Kenneth Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Kon_Shing_Kenneth", "Liaquat Hossain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hossain:Liaquat"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
