In this paper, we similarly generalize the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to Bregman ADMM (BADMM), which allows the choice of different Bregman divergences to exploit the structure of problems. BADMM provides a unified framework for ADMM and its variants, including generalized ADMM, inexact ADMM and Bethe ADMM. We establish the global convergence and the O(1/T) iteration complexity for BADMM. In some cases, BADMM can be faster than ADMM by a factor of O(n/ln n) where n is the dimensionality. In solving the linear program of mass transportation problem, BADMM leads to massive parallelism and can easily run on GPU. BADMM is several times faster than highly optimized commercial software Gurobi.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Huahua Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huahua", "Arindam Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Arindam"], "pages": 9}
