They have become popular in graphics, vision, and HCI communities as they enable numerous applications such as 3D capture, gesture recognition, virtual fitting, etc. Nowadays, common sensors can deliver a stream of color images and depth maps in VGA resolution at 30 fps. While the color image is usually of sufficient quality for visualization, depth information (represented as a point cloud) is usually too sparse and noisy for readable rendering.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rakuten"], "authors": ["Tony Tung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tung:Tony"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
