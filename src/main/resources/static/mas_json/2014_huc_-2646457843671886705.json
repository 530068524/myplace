Using three-axis accelerometer data obtained through wearable wireless sensors, we compare recognition results for two different classifiers -- Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree -- in combination with different feature sets based on time-frequency characteristics of accelerometer data. We use data collected from six individuals on the autism spectrum who participated in two different studies conducted three years apart in classroom settings, and observe an average accuracy across all participants over time ranging from 81.2% (TPR: 0.91; FPR: 0.21) to 99.1% (TPR: 0.99; FPR: 0.01) for all combinations of classifiers and feature sets. We also provide analyses of kinematic parameters associated with observed movements in an attempt to explain classifier-feature specific performance. Based on our results, we conclude that real-time, person-dependent, adaptive algorithms are needed in order to accurately and consistently measure SMM automatically in individuals on the autism spectrum over time in real-word settings.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Matthew S.
