We investigate the sentiment of annual disclosures of companies in stock markets to forecast volatility. We specifically explore the use of recent Information Retrieval (IR) term weighting models that are effectively extended by related terms using word embeddings. In parallel to textual information, factual market data have been widely used as the mainstream approach to forecast market risk. We therefore study different fusion methods to combine text and market data resources. Our word embedding-based approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we investigate the characteristics of the reports of the companies in different financial sectors.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Ural Federal University", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Navid Rekabsaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rekabsaz:Navid", "Mihai Lupu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lupu:Mihai", "Artem Baklanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baklanov:Artem", "Alexander D\u00fcr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=uuml=r:Alexander", "Linda Andersson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andersson:Linda", "Allan Hanbury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanbury:Allan"], "pages": 10}
