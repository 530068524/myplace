{"title": "Position Tracking for Virtual Reality Using Commodity WiFi.", "fields": ["headset", "headphones", "software deployment", "commodity", "user experience design"], "abstract": "Today, experiencing virtual reality (VR) is a cumbersome experience which either requires dedicated infrastructure like infrared cameras to track the headset and hand-motion controllers (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive), or provides only 3-DoF (Degrees of Freedom) tracking which severely limits the user experience (e.g., Samsung Gear). To truly enable VR everywhere, we need position tracking to be available as a ubiquitous service. This paper presents WiCapture, a novel approach which leverages commodity WiFi infrastructure, which is ubiquitous today, for tracking purposes. We prototype WiCapture using off-the-shelf WiFi radios and show that it achieves an accuracy of 0.88 cm compared to sophisticated infrared-based tracking systems like the Oculus, while providing much higher range, resistance to occlusion, ubiquity and ease of deployment.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Manikanta Kotaru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotaru:Manikanta", "Sachin Katti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katti:Sachin"], "pages": 11}
