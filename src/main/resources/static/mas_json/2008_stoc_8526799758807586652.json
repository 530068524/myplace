We are given an undirected graph G=(V,E) with edges costs c(e) and a set of terminal nodes W. A  hose  demand matrix for W is any symmetric matrix [D ij ] such that for each i, \u2211 j \u2260 i D ij  \u2264 1. We must compute the minimum cost edge capacities that are able to support the oblivious routing of every hose matrix in the network.   An  oblivious routing  template, in this context, is a simple path P ij  for each pair i,j \u2208 W. Given such a template, if we are to route a demand matrix D, then for each i,j we send D ij  units of flow along each P ij . Fingerhut et al. and Gupta et al. obtained a 2-approximation for this problem, using a solution template in the form of a tree. It has been widely asked and subsequently conjectured [Italiano 2006] that this solution actually results in the optimal capacity for the single path VPN design problem; this has become known as the  VPN conjecture . The conjecture has previously been proven for some restricted classes of graphs [Hurkens 2005, Grandoni 2007, Fiorini 2007]. Our main theorem establishes that this conjecture is true in general graphs. This also gives the first polynomial time algorithm for the single path VPN problem. We also show that the multipath version of the conjecture is false.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "McGill University", "McGill University", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "McGill University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Navin Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Navin", "Neil Olver.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olver:Neil", "F.
