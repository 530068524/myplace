{"title": "Architecture exploration for ambient energy harvesting nonvolatile processors.", "fields": ["energy harvesting", "solar energy", "radiation", "architecture", "computation"], "abstract": "Energy harvesting has been widely investigated as a promising method of providing power for ultra-low-power applications. Such energy sources include solar energy, radio-frequency (RF) radiation, piezoelectricity, thermal gradients, etc. However, the power supplied by these sources is highly unreliable and dependent upon ambient environment factors. Hence, it is necessary to develop specialized systems that are tolerant to this power variation, and also capable of making forward progress on the computation tasks. The simulation platform in this paper is calibrated using measured results from a fabricated nonvolatile processor and used to explore the design space for a nonvolatile processor with different architectures, different input power sources, and policies for maximizing forward progress.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Kaisheng Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Kaisheng", "Yang Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yang", "Shuangchen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shuangchen", "Karthik Swaminathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swaminathan:Karthik", "Xueqing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xueqing", "Yongpan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yongpan", "Jack Sampson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sampson:Jack", "Yuan Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Yuan", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanan:Vijaykrishnan"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
