You separately get logs from the server; these are untrusted. How can you use the logs to efficiently verify that the responses were derived from running the program on the requests? This is the Efficient Server Audit Problem, which abstracts real-world scenarios, including running a web application on an untrusted provider. We give a solution based on several new techniques, including simultaneous replay and efficient verification of concurrent executions. We implement the solution for PHP web applications. For several applications, our verifier achieves 5.6-10.9x speedup versus simply re-executing, with", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Two Sigma Investments"], "authors": ["Cheng Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Cheng", "Lingfan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Lingfan", "Joshua B.
