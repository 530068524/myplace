{"title": "TeleAdvisor: a versatile augmented reality tool for remote assistance.", "fields": ["robotic arm", "video camera", "projector", "workspace", "projective space"], "abstract": "TeleAdvisor is a novel solution designed to support remote assistance tasks in many real-world scenarios. It consists of a video camera and a small projector mounted at the end of a tele-operated robotic arm. This enables a remote helper to view and interact with the workers' workspace, while controlling the point of view. It also provides the worker with a hands-free transportable device to be placed anywhere in his or her environment. Active tracking of the projection space is used in order to reliably correlate between the camera's view and the projector space.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Pavel Gurevich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurevich:Pavel", "Joel Lanir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lanir:Joel", "Benjamin Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Benjamin", "Ran Stone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stone:Ran"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
