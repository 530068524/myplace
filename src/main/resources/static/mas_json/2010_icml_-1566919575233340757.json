This problem is challenging because the brain's electrical activity is composed of numerous classes with overlapping characteristics. The key steps involved in realizing a high performance algorithm included shaping the problem into an appropriate machine learning framework, and identifying the features critical to separating seizure from other types of brain activity. When trained on 2 or more seizures per patient and tested on 916 hours of continuous EEG from 24 patients, our algorithm detected 96% of 173 test seizures with a median detection delay of 3 seconds and a median false detection rate of 2 false detections per 24 hour period.
