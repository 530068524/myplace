Multi-path routing has the potential of improving the throughput but requires buffers at the destination. Our model assumes a network with capacitated edges and a delay function associated with the network links (edges). We consider the problem of establishing a specified throughput from source to destination in the network, given bounds on the buffer size available at the destination and a bound on the maximum delay paths are allowed to have. A related problem which we consider is to establish bounds on the delay variance (which we call jitter) amongst the paths chosen for the multi-path routing scheme. We show that the problems are NP-complete and present pseudo-polynomial algorithms based on linear programming. We also propose practical heuristics and present the experimental results on an existing network topology. The results are promising.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Tricha Anjali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anjali:Tricha", "Gruia Calinescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calinescu:Gruia", "Alexander Fortin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fortin:Alexander", "Sanjiv Kapoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapoor:Sanjiv", "Nandakiran Kirubanandan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirubanandan:Nandakiran", "Sutep Tongngam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tongngam:Sutep"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 7}
