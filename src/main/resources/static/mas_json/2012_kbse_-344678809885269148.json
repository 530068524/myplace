In all cases, the results of a search depend on the query formulated by the developer. A developer needs to run a query and look at the results before realizing that it needs reformulating. Our aim is to automatically assess the performance of a query before it is executed. We introduce an automatic query performance assessment approach for software artifact retrieval, which uses 21 measures from the field of text retrieval. We evaluate the approach in the context of concept location in source code. The evaluation shows that our approach is able to predict the performance of queries with 79% accuracy, using very little training data.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Wayne State University", "University of Salerno", "University of Molise", "University of Salerno", "Wayne State University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Sonia Haiduc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haiduc:Sonia", "Gabriele Bavota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bavota:Gabriele", "Rocco Oliveto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveto:Rocco", "Andrea De Lucia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucia:Andrea_De", "Andrian Marcus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marcus:Andrian"], "pages": 10}
