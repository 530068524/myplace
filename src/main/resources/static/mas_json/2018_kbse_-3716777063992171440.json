To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a debugging approach for microservice systems based on the delta debugging algorithm, which is to minimize failureinducing deltas of circumstances (e.g., deployment, environmental configurations) for effective debugging. Our approach includes novel techniques for defining, deploying/manipulating, and executing deltas following the idea of delta debugging. In particular, to construct a (failing) circumstance space for delta debugging to minimize, our approach defines a set of dimensions that can affect the execution of microservice systems. Our experimental study on a medium-size microservice benchmark system shows that our approach can effectively identify failure-inducing deltas that help diagnose the root causes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Xiang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiang", "Xin Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Xin", "Tao Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Tao", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Wenhai Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenhai", "Chao Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Chao", "Dan Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Dan"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
