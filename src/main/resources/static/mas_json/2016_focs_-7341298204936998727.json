We give a short,simple, self-contained proof that the estimator can be computedin linear time and has relative variance O(n2). Combining thesetwo facts with a standard sparsification argument yields anO(n3 log n)-time algorithm for estimating the (un)reliability ofa network. We also show how the technique can be used tocreate unbiased samples of disconnected networks", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["David R.
