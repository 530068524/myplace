However, inferring hierarchical relations between concepts from tags has a drawback in that it is difficult to distinguish between more popular and more general concepts. Instead of tags we propose to use user-specified relations for learning folksonomy. We explore two statistical frameworks for aggregating many shallow individual hierarchies, expressed through the collection/set relations on the social photosharing site Flickr, into a common deeper folksonomy that reflects how a community organizes knowledge. Our approach addresses a number of challenges that arise while aggregating information from diverse users, namely noisy vocabulary, and variations in the granularity level of the concepts expressed. Our second contribution is a method for automatically evaluating learned folksonomy by comparing it to a reference taxonomy, e.g., the Web directory created by the Open Directory Project. Our empirical results suggest that user-specified relations are a good source of evidence for learning folksonomies.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["Information Sciences Institute", "Information Sciences Institute"], "authors": ["Anon Plangprasopchok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plangprasopchok:Anon", "Kristina Lerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerman:Kristina"], "conf": "www", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
