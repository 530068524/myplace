{"title": "\"You are no Jack Kennedy\": On Media Selection of Highlights from Presidential Debates.", "fields": ["research question", "media bias", "presidential system", "utterance", "political communication"], "abstract": "Political speeches and debates play an important role in shaping the images of politicians, and the public often relies on media outlets to select bits of political communication from a large pool of utterances. It is an important research question to understand what factors impact this selection process. To quantitatively explore the selection process, we build a three-decade dataset of presidential debate transcripts and post-debate coverage. We first examine the effect of wording and propose a binary classification framework that controls for both the speaker and the debate situations. We find that crowdworkers can only achieve an accuracy of 60% in this task, indicating that media choices are not entirely obvious. Our classifiers outperform crowdworkers on average, mainly in primary debates. We also compare important factors from crowdworkers\u2019 free responses with those from data-driven methods and find interesting differences. Few crowdworkers mentioned that \u201ccontext matters\u201d, whereas our data show that well-quoted sentences are more distinct from the previous utterance by the same speaker than less-quoted sentences. Finally, we examine the aggregate effect of media preferences towards different wordings to understand the extent of fragmentation among media outlets. By analyzing a bipartite graph built from quoting behavior in our data, we observe a decreasing trend in bipartisan coverage.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Chenhao Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chenhao", "Hao Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Hao", "Noah A.
