From a system designer\u2019s perspective, in order to achieve better user experience in these applications, we should take both the efficiency and fairness of a dating market into consideration, so as to increase the overall satisfaction for all users. Towards this goal, we investigate the nature of diminishing marginal returns for online dating markets (i.e., captured by the submodularity), and trade-off between the efficiency and fairness of the market with Nash social welfare. We further design effective online algorithms to the apps. We verify our models and algorithms through sound theoretical analysis and empirical studies by using real data and show that our algorithms can significantly improve the ecosystems of the online dating applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "McGill University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yongzheng Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yongzheng", "Xue Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xue", "Wei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Wei"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
