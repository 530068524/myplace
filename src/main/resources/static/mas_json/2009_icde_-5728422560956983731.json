{"title": "Light-Weight, Runtime Verification of Query Sources.", "fields": ["runtime verification", "cryptographic hash function", "database server", "merkle tree", "view"], "abstract": "Modern database systems increasingly make use of networked storage. This storage can be in the form of SAN's or in the form of shared-nothing nodes in a cluster. One type of attack on databases is arbitrary modification of data in a database through the file system, bypassing database access control. Additionally, for many applications, ensuring strict and definite authenticity of query source and results is required or highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a lightweight approach for verifying the minimum information that a database server needs from the storage system to execute a query. The verification is definite and produces high confidence results because of its online manner (i.e., the information is verified right before it is used). It is lightweight in three ways: (1) We use the Merkle hash tree data structure and fast cryptographic hash functions to ensure the verification itself is fast and secure; (2) We verify the minimum number of bytes needed to ensure the authenticity of the source related to the query result; and (3) We achieve high concurrency of multiple reader and writer transactions and avoid delays due to locking by using the compare-and-swap primitive. We then prove the correctness and progress guarantees of the algorithms using concepts from the theory of distributed computing. We also analyze the performance of the algorithm. Finally, we perform a comprehensive empirical study on various parameter choices and on the system performance and concurrency with our approaches.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University"], "authors": ["Tingjian Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Tingjian", "Stanley B.
