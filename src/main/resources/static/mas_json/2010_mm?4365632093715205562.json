{"title": "Leveraging loosely-tagged images and inter-object correlations for tag recommendation.", "fields": ["the internet", "structured support vector machine", "classifier", "statistical relational learning", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "Large-scale loosely-tagged images (i.e., multiple object tags are given loosely at the image level) are available on Internet, and it is very attractive to leverage such loosely-tagged images for automatic image annotation applications. In this paper, a multi-task structured SVM algorithm is developed to leverage both the inter-object correlations and the loosely-tagged images for achieving more effective training of a large number of inter-related object classifiers. To leverage the loosely-tagged images for object classifier training, each loosely-tagged image is partitioned into a set of image instances (image regions) and a multiple instance learning algorithm is developed for instance label identification by automatically identifying the correspondences between multiple tags (given at the image level) and the image instances. An object correlation network is constructed for characterizing the inter-object correlations explicitly and identifying the inter-related learning tasks automatically. To enhance the discrimination power of a large number of inter-related object classifiers, a multi-task structured SVM algorithm is developed to model the inter-task relatedness more precisely and leverage the inter-object correlations for classifier training. Our experiments on a large number of inter-related object classes have provided very positive results.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["Yi Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yi", "Jianping Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan_0001:Jianping"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
