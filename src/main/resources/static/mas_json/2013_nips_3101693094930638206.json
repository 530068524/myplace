Our motivation comes from recent employment of bandit algorithms in computationally intensive, large-scale applications. Our results demonstrate a non-trivial tradeoff between the number of arm pulls required by each of the players, and the amount of communication between them. In particular, our main result shows that by allowing the k players to communicate only once, they are able to learn \u221ak times faster than a single player. That is, distributing learning to k players gives rise to a factor \u221ak parallel speedup. We complement this result with a lower bound showing this is in general the best possible. On the other extreme, we present an algorithm that achieves the ideal factor k speed-up in learning performance, with communication only logarithmic in 1/e.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Eshcar Hillel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hillel:Eshcar", "Zohar Shay Karnin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karnin:Zohar_Shay", "Tomer Koren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koren:Tomer", "Ronny Lempel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lempel:Ronny", "Oren Somekh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Somekh:Oren"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
