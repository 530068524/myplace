{"title": "DoCQS: a prototype system for supporting data-oriented content query.", "fields": ["relational model", "web query classification", "query expansion", "sargable", "web search query"], "abstract": "Witnessing the richness of data in document content and many ad-hoc efforts for finding such data, we propose a Data-oriented Content Query System( DoCQS ), which is oriented towards fine granularity data of all types by searching directly into document content. DoCQS uses the relational model as the underlying data model, and offers a powerful and flexible Content Query Language( CQL ) to adapt to diverse query demands. In this demonstration, we show how to model various search tasks by CQL statements, and how the system architecture efficiently supports the CQL execution. Our online demo of the system is available at http://wisdm.cs.uiuc.edu/demos/docqs/.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mianwei Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Mianwei", "Tao Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng_0001:Tao", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kevin_Chen=Chuan"], "pages": 4}
