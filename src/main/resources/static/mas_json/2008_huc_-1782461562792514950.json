The use of topic models enables the automatic discovery of such patterns in a user's daily routine. We report experimental results that show the ability of the approach to model and recognize daily routines without user annotation.", "citation": "Citations (423)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["T\u00e2m Huynh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huynh:T=acirc=m", "Mario Fritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fritz:Mario", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
