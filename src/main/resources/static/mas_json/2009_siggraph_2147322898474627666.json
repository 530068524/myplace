Because high plasma concentrations of cholesterol, in particular those of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, are one of the principal risk factors for atherosclerosis,1 the process of atherogenesis has been considered by many to consist largely of the accumulation of lipids within the artery wall; however, it is much more than that. Despite changes in lifestyle and the use of new pharmacologic approaches to lower plasma cholesterol concentrations,2,3 cardiovascular disease continues to be the principal cause of death in the United States, Europe, and much of Asia.4,5 In fact, the lesions of atherosclerosis represent .\u00a0.\u00a0.", "citation": "Citations (24,261)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Karolinska Institutet", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Lippincott Williams & Wilkins", "Cardiovascular Center of Aalst"], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Thomas Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brown:Thomas"], "pages": 1}
