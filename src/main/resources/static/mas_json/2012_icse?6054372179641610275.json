{"title": "Teaching software engineering and software project management: An integrated and practical approach.", "fields": ["project management 2 0", "project management triangle", "software project management", "social software engineering", "software development process"], "abstract": "We present a practical approach for teaching two different courses of Software Engineering (SE) and Software Project Management (SPM) in an integrated way. The two courses are taught in the same semester, thus allowing to build mixed project teams composed of five-eight Bachelor's students (with development roles) and one or two Master's students (with management roles). The main goal of our approach is to simulate a real-life development scenario giving to the students the possibility to deal with issues arising from typical project situations, such as working in a team, organising the division of work, and coping with time pressure and strict deadlines.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Salerno", "University of Salerno", "University of Molise", "University of Molise", "University of Salerno"], "authors": ["Gabriele Bavota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bavota:Gabriele", "Andrea De Lucia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucia:Andrea_De", "Fausto Fasano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fasano:Fausto", "Rocco Oliveto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveto:Rocco", "Carlo Zottoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zottoli:Carlo"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
