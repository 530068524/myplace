The key idea is that exploring task relatedness (structure) can lead to improved performances. In this paper, we propose and study a novel sparse, nonparametric approach exploiting the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces for vector-valued functions. We develop a suitable regularization framework which can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, and is provably solvable using an alternating minimization approach. Empirical tests show that the proposed method compares favorably to state of the art techniques and further allows to recover interpretable structures, a problem of interest in its own right.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Genoa"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Carlo Ciliberto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciliberto:Carlo", "Lorenzo Rosasco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosasco:Lorenzo", "Silvia Villa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villa:Silvia"], "pages": 9}
