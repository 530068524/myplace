{"title": "Predict Anchor Links across Social Networks via an Embedding Approach.", "fields": ["computer science", "artificial intelligence", "social network", "embedding", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Predicting anchor links across social networks has important implications to an array of applications, including cross-network information diffusion and cross-domain recommendation. One challenging problem is: whether and to what extent we can address the anchor link prediction problem, if only structural information of networks is available. Most existing methods, unsupervised or supervised, directly work on networks themselves rather than on their intrinsic structural regularities, and thus their effectiveness is sensitive to the high dimension and sparsity of networks. To offer a robust method, we propose a novel supervised model, called PALE, which employs network embedding with awareness of observed anchor links as supervised information to capture the major and specific structural regularities and further learns a stable cross-network mapping for predicting anchor links. Through extensive experiments on two realistic datasets, we demonstrate that PALE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Tong Man.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Man:Tong", "Huawei Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Huawei", "Shenghua Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shenghua", "Xiaolong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xiaolong", "Xueqi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xueqi"], "pages": 7}
