Central to our analysis is a problem-specific value r which quantifies the communication/computation tradeoff. We show that organizing the communication among nodes as a k-regular expander graph [1] yields speedups, while when all pairs of nodes communicate (as in a complete graph), there is an optimal number of processors that depends on r. Surprisingly, a speedup can be obtained, in terms of the time to reach a fixed level of accuracy, by communicating less and less frequently as the computation progresses. Experiments on a real cluster solving metric learning and non-smooth convex minimization tasks demonstrate strong agreement between theory and practice.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Konstantinos I.
