Projects spun out of the lab's efforts include the VR2GO smartphone based viewer, the inVerse tablet based viewer, the Socket HMD reference design, the Oculus Rift and the Project Holodeck gaming platforms, a repurposed FOV2GO design with Nokia Lumia phones for a 3D user interface course at Columbia University, and the EventLab's Socket based HMD at the University of Barcelona. A subset of these will be demonstrated. This open approach is providing low cost yet surprisingly compelling immersive experiences.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "Oculus VR", "University of Southern California", "USC Institute f ... ve Technologies"], "authors": ["Mark T.
