{"title": "In-field healing of integration problems with COTS components.", "fields": ["debugging", "on the fly", "application software", "software fault tolerance", "web server"], "abstract": "Developers frequently integrate complex COTS frameworks and components in software applications. COTS products are often only partially documented, and developers may misuse technologies and introduce integration faults, as witnessed by the many entries in fault repositories. Once identified, common integration problems and their fixes are usually documented in forums and fault repositories on the Web, but this does not prevent them to occur in the field when COTS products are reused.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Milano-Bicocca"], "authors": ["Herv\u00e9 Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Herv=eacute=", "Leonardo Mariani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mariani:Leonardo", "Mauro Pezz\u00e8.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pezz=egrave=:Mauro"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 11}
