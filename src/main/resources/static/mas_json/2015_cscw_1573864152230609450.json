GitHub has created efficiencies and helped improve the way software professionals work. It not only provides a traceable project repository, but it acts as a social meeting place for interested parties, supporting communities of practice. Recently, educators have seen the potential in GitHub's collaborative features for managing and improving---perhaps even transforming---the learning experience. In this study, we examine how GitHub is emerging as a collaborative platform for education. We aim to understand how environments such as GitHub---environments that provide social and collaborative features in conjunction with distributed version control---may improve (or possibly hinder) the educational experience for students and teachers. We conduct a qualitative study focusing on how GitHub is being used in education, and the motivations, benefits and challenges it brings.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Alexey Zagalsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zagalsky:Alexey", "Joseph Feliciano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feliciano:Joseph", "Margaret-Anne D.
