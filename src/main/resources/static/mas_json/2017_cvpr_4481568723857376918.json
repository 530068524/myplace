Instance segmentation is very important in a variety of applications, such as autonomous driving, image captioning, and visual question answering. Techniques that combine large graphical models with low-level vision have been proposed to address this problem, however, we propose an end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with an attention mechanism to model a human-like counting process, and produce detailed instance segmentations. The network is jointly trained to sequentially produce regions of interest as well as a dominant object segmentation within each region. The proposed model achieves competitive results on the CVPPP [27], KITTI [12], and Cityscapes [8] datasets.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mengye Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Mengye", "Richard S.
