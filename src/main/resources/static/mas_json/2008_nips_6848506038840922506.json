{"title": "On the asymptotic equivalence between differential Hebbian and temporal difference learning using a local third factor.", "fields": ["hebbian theory", "equivalence", "mathematical proof", "reinforcement learning", "temporal difference learning"], "abstract": "In this theoretical contribution we provide mathematical proof that two of the most important classes of network learning - correlation-based differential Heb-bian learning and reward-based temporal difference learning - are asymptotically equivalent when timing the learning with a local modulatory signal. This opens the opportunity to consistently reformulate most of the abstract reinforcement learning framework from a correlation based perspective that is more closely related to the biophysics of neurons.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of G\u00f6ttingen", "University of Glasgow", "University of G\u00f6ttingen", "University of G\u00f6ttingen"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Christoph Kolodziejski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolodziejski:Christoph", "Bernd Porr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porr:Bernd", "Minija Tamosiunaite.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamosiunaite:Minija", "Florentin W\u00f6rg\u00f6tter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/W=ouml=rg=ouml=tter:Florentin"], "pages": 8}
