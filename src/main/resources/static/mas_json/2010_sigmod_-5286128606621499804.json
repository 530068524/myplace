{"title": "ONDUX: on-demand unsupervised learning for information extraction.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "text segmentation", "test data", "unsupervised learning", "string"], "abstract": "Information extraction by text segmentation (IETS) applies to cases in which data values of interest are organized in implicit semi-structured records available in textual sources (e.g. postal addresses, bibliographic information, ads). It is an important practical problem that has been frequently addressed in the recent literature. In this paper we introduce ONDUX (On Demand Unsupervised Information Extraction), a new unsupervised probabilistic approach for IETS. As other unsupervised IETS approaches, ONDUX relies on information available on pre-existing data to associate segments in the input string with attributes of a given domain. Unlike other approaches, we rely on very effective matching strategies instead of explicit learning strategies. The effectiveness of this matching strategy is also exploited to disambiguate the extraction of certain attributes through a reinforcement step that explores sequencing and positioning of attribute values directly learned  on-demand  from test data, with no previous human-driven training, a feature unique to ONDUX. This assigns to ONDUX a high degree of flexibility and results in superior effectiveness, as demonstrated by the experimental evaluation we report with textual sources from different domains, in which ONDUX is compared with a state-of-art IETS approach.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Federal University of Amazonas", "Federal University of Amazonas", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Federal University of Amazonas"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Eli Cortez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cortez:Eli", "Altigran Soares da Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva:Altigran_Soares_da", "Marcos Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Marcos_Andr=eacute=", "Edleno Silva de Moura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moura:Edleno_Silva_de"], "pages": 12}
