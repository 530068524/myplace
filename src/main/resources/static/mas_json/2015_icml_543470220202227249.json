Designing predictive models for such event streams is an under-explored problem, due to often scarce training data. In this work we propose a multitask point process model, leveraging information from all tasks via a hierarchical Gaussian process (GP). Nonparametric learning functions implemented by a GP, which map from past events to future rates, allow analysis of flexible arrival patterns. To facilitate efficient inference, we propose a sparse construction for this hierarchical model, and derive a variational Bayes method for learning and inference. Experimental results are shown on both synthetic data and as well as real electronic health-records data.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Purdue University", "Durham University", "Duke University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Wenzhao Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Wenzhao", "Ricardo Henao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henao:Ricardo", "Vinayak Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Vinayak", "Joseph E.
