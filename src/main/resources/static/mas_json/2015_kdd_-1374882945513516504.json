We consider cross validation for the selection process, so several optimization problems under different parameters must be solved. Our aim is to devise effective warm-start strategies to efficiently solve this sequence of optimization problems. We detailedly investigate the relationship between optimal solutions of logistic regression/linear SVM and regularization parameters. Based on the analysis, we develop an efficient tool to automatically find a suitable parameter for users with no related background knowledge.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Bo-Yu Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Bo=Yu", "Chia-Hua Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Chia=Hua", "Cheng-Hao Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Cheng=Hao", "Chieh-Yen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chieh=Yen", "Chih-Jen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chih=Jen"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
