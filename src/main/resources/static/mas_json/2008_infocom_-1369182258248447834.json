We analyze packet arrival rates and packet departure rates for the forwarding queues at relaying nodes and then derive the throughput and packet delay experienced by nodes at different hop count distances to the gateway. Based on this model, we further analyze how network design strategies affect the throughput and delay of each node. We then conduct simulations to validate our analytical model and evaluate the performance of different network design strategies. This paper not only provides a framework for studying the location-dependent throughput and delay in wireless mesh networks but also gives insights into the network design strategy for wireless mesh networks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Tehuang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tehuang", "Wanjiun Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Wanjiun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
