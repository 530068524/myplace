{"title": "Multi-view latent variable discriminative models for action recognition.", "fields": ["pose", "discriminative model", "latent variable", "disjoint sets", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "Many human action recognition tasks involve data that can be factorized into multiple views such as body postures and hand shapes. These views often interact with each other over time, providing important cues to understanding the action. We present multi-view latent variable discriminative models that jointly learn both view-shared and view-specific sub-structures to capture the interaction between views. Knowledge about the underlying structure of the data is formulated as a multi-chain structured latent conditional model, explicitly learning the interaction between multiple views using disjoint sets of hidden variables in a discriminative manner. The chains are tied using a predetermined topology that repeats over time. We present three topologies \u2014 linked, coupled, and linked-coupled \u2014 that differ in the type of interaction between views that they model. We evaluate our approach on both segmented and unsegmented human action recognition tasks, using the ArmGesture, the NATOPS, and the ArmGesture-Continuous data. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art action recognition models.", "citation": "Citations (39)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "USC Institute f ... tive Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yale Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yale", "Louis-Philippe Morency.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morency:Louis=Philippe", "Randall Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Randall"], "pages": 8}
