The model is generated by factorizing the measurements into pose and shape dependent components. By combining it with an ICP based registration method, we are able to estimate pose and body shape of dressed subjects from single images. If several images of the subject are available, shape and poses can be optimized simultaneously for all input images. Additionally, while estimating pose and shape, we use the model as a virtual calibration pattern and also recover the parameters of the perspective camera model the images were created with.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Nils Hasler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasler:Nils", "Hanno Ackermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ackermann:Hanno", "Bodo Rosenhahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenhahn:Bodo", "Thorsten Thorm\u00e4hlen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thorm=auml=hlen:Thorsten", "Hans-Peter Seidel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidel:Hans=Peter"], "pages": 8}
