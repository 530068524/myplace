We first provide the semantic integration of two interrelated BTs using an extended version of Communicating Sequential Processes. We then use a Semantic Network Model to capture a set of interrelated BTs, and develop algorithm to integrate them all into one BT. This formalisation facilitates developing (semi-)automated tools for modeling the requirements of large-scale software intensive systems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Griffith University", "Griffith University", "Institute for I ... bane, Australia", "Institute for I ... bane, Australia"], "authors": ["Kushal Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Kushal", "M.
