{"title": "Scalable Gaussian Processes with Grid-Structured Eigenfunctions (GP-GRIEF).", "fields": ["tensor product", "cartesian product", "bayesian inference", "marginal likelihood", "kronecker delta"], "abstract": "We introduce a kernel approximation strategy that enables computation of the Gaussian process log marginal likelihood and all hyperparameter derivatives in $\\mathcal{O}(p)$ time. Our GRIEF kernel consists of $p$ eigenfunctions found using a Nystrom approximation from a dense Cartesian product grid of inducing points. By exploiting algebraic properties of Kronecker and Khatri-Rao tensor products, computational complexity of the training procedure can be practically independent of the number of inducing points. This allows us to use arbitrarily many inducing points to achieve a globally accurate kernel approximation, even in high-dimensional problems. The fast likelihood evaluation enables type-I or II Bayesian inference on large-scale datasets. We benchmark our algorithms on real-world problems with up to two-million training points and $10^{33}$ inducing points.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Trefor W.
