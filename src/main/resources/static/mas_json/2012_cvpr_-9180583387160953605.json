The proposed method is based on two observations: first, skin colors tend to form a cluster in the color space, making it a cue to estimate the illuminant in the scene; second, many photographic images are portraits or contain people. The proposed method has been tested on a public dataset of images in RAW format, using both a manual and a real face detector. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed method can be directly used in many digital still camera processing pipelines with an embedded face detector working on gray level images.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Milano-Bicocca"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Simone Bianco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bianco:Simone", "Raimondo Schettini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schettini:Raimondo"], "pages": 8}
