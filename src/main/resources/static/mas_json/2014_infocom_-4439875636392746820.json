Various multilayer architectures employing thousands of switches have been proposed in the literature. We make use of the observation that the traffic in a data center is a mixture of relatively static and rapidly fluctuating components, and develop a combined scheduler for both these components using a generalization of the load-balanced scheduler. The presence of the known static component introduces asymmetries in the ingress-egress capacities, which preclude the use of a load-balanced scheduler as is. We generalize the load-balanced scheduler and also incorporate an opportunistic scheduler that sends traffic on a direct path when feasible to enhance the overall switch throughput. Our evaluations show that this scheduler works very well despite avoiding the use of a central scheduler for making packet-by-packet scheduling decisions.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["New York University", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "New York University", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Zizhong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Zizhong", "Murali S.
