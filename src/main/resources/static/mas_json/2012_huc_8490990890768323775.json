We investigate how tracking practices reconfigure human-dog relationships changing both humans and dogs. We question the sensemaking mechanisms by which both humans and dogs engage in context-based meaningful exchanges via the technology's mediation. We show how an indexical semiotic perspective could inform the development of interspecies technology. Finally, we discuss the methodological issues raised by doing research  with  animals and propose an interspecies semiotics which integrates animal companions and animal researchers' accounts into ethnographic observation.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Open University", "Open University", "Retrieva Ltd, Berkhamsted, UK", "Retrieva Ltd, Berkhamsted, UK"], "authors": ["Clara Mancini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancini:Clara", "Janet van der Linden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linden:Janet_van_der", "Jon Bryan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bryan:Jon", "Andrew Stuart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stuart:Andrew"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
