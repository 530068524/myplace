However, learning a compact set of higher-order spatial features based on visual words, e.g., doublets and triplets, remains a challenging problem as possible combinations of visual words grow exponentially. While the local pairwise codebook achieves a compact codebook of pairs of spatially close local features without feature selection, its formulation is not scale invariant and is only suitable for densely sampled local features. In contrast, the proximity distribution kernel is a scale-invariant and robust representation capturing rich spatial proximity information between local features, but its representation grows quadratically in the number of visual words. Inspired by the two abovementioned techniques, this paper presents the compact correlation coding that combines the strengths of the two. Our method achieves a compact representation that is scaleinvariant and robust against object deformation. In addition, we adopt sparse coding instead of k-means clustering during the codebook construction to increase the discriminative power of our method. We systematically evaluate our method against both the local pairwise codebook and proximity distribution kernel on several challenging object categorization datasets to show performance improvements.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "National Institute of Informatics"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Nobuyuki Morioka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morioka:Nobuyuki", "Shin'ichi Satoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satoh:Shin=ichi"], "pages": 8}
