Building on this observation, we have developed an end to end system ActivPass and experimented with 70 users. With activity logs from Facebook, browsing history, call logs, and SMSs, the system achieves 95% success (authenticates legitimate users) and is compromised in 5.5% cases (authenticates impostors). While this level of security is obviously inadequate for serious authentication systems, certain practices such as password sharing can immediately be thwarted from the dynamic nature of passwords. With security improvements in the future, activity-based authentication could fill in for the inadequacies in today's password-based systems.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "University of Texas at Austin", "Indian Institutes of Technology", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sourav Kumar Dandapat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dandapat:Sourav_Kumar", "Swadhin Pradhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pradhan:Swadhin", "Bivas Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Bivas", "Romit Roy Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Romit_Roy", "Niloy Ganguly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganguly:Niloy"], "pages": 10}
