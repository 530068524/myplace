The approach yields comparable recognition rates with the random l 1  approach [18], which is considered the state-of-the-art. But our method is much faster: it is up to 150 times faster than [18] on the YaleB dataset. We show that with hashing, the sparse representation can be recovered with a high probability because hashing preserves the restrictive isometry property. Moreover, we present a theoretical analysis on the recognition rate of the proposed hashing approach. Experiments show a very competitive recognition rate and significant speedup compared with the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Qinfeng Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Qinfeng", "Hanxi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hanxi", "Chunhua Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chunhua"], "pages": 8}
