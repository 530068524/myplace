{"title": "Dense non-rigid surface registration using high-order graph matching.", "fields": ["3 dimensional matching", "curvature", "polygon mesh", "embedding", "matching"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a high-order graph matching formulation to address non-rigid surface matching. The singleton terms capture the geometric and appearance similarities (e.g., curvature and texture) while the high-order terms model the intrinsic embedding energy. The novelty of this paper includes: 1) casting 3D surface registration into a graph matching problem that combines both geometric and appearance similarities and intrinsic embedding information, 2) the first implementation of high-order graph matching algorithm that solves a non-convex optimization problem, and 3) an efficient two-stage optimization approach to constrain the search space for dense surface registration. Our method is validated through a series of experiments demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency, notably in challenging cases of large and/or non-isometric deformations, or meshes that are partially occluded.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yun Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Yun", "Chaohui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chaohui", "Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Yang", "Xianfeng Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Xianfeng", "Dimitris Samaras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samaras:Dimitris", "Nikos Paragios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paragios:Nikos"], "pages": 8}
