{"title": "Constructing Abstraction Hierarchies Using a Skill-Symbol Loop.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "symbol", "abstraction", "markov decision process", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "We describe a framework for building abstraction hierarchies whereby an agent alternates skill- and representation-construction phases to construct a sequence of increasingly abstract Markov decision processes. Our formulation builds on recent results showing that the appropriate abstract representation of a problem is specified by the agent's skills. We describe how such a hierarchy can be used for fast planning, and illustrate the construction of an appropriate hierarchy for the Taxi domain.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Duke University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George"], "pages": 7}
