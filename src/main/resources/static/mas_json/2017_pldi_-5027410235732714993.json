{"title": "Generalizations of the theory and deployment of triangular inequality for compiler-based strength reduction.", "fields": ["implementation", "deep learning", "optimizing compiler", "speedup", "strength reduction"], "abstract": "Triangular Inequality (TI) has been used in many manual algorithm designs to achieve good efficiency in solving some distance calculation-based problems. This paper presents our generalization of the idea into a compiler optimization technique, named TI-based strength reduction. The generalization consists of three parts. The first is the establishment of the theoretic foundation of this new optimization via the development of a new form of TI named Angular Triangular Inequality, along with several fundamental theorems. The second is the revealing of the properties of the new forms of TI and the proposal of guided TI adaptation, a systematic method to address the difficulties in effective deployments of TI optimizations. The third is an integration of the new optimization technique in an open-source compiler. Experiments on a set of data mining and machine learning algorithms show that the new technique can speed up the standard implementations by as much as 134X and 46X on average for distance-related problems, outperforming previous TI-based optimizations by 2.35X on average. It also extends the applicability of TI-based optimizations to vector related problems, producing tens of times of speedup.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Yufei Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Yufei", "Lin Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Lin", "Hui Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Hui", "Xipeng Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xipeng"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2017", "pages": 16}
