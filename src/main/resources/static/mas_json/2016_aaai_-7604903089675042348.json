{"title": "Computing Rational Decisions In Extensive Games With Limited Foresight.", "fields": ["extensive form game", "solution concept", "exploit", "futures studies", "intuition"], "abstract": "We introduce a class of extensive form games where players might not be able to foresee the possible consequences of their decisions and form a model of their opponents which they exploit to achieve a more profitable outcome. We improve upon existing models of games with limited foresight, endowing players with the ability of higher order reasoning and proposing a novel solution concept to address intuitions coming from real game play. We analyse the resulting equilibria, devising an effective procedure to compute them.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Paolo Turrini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turrini:Paolo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
