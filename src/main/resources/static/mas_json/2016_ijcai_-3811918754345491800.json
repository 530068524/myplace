Two main classes of feature selection methods - filter and wrapper - discard those features which are not selected, and do not consider them in the predictive model. We propose that these unselected features may instead be used as an additional source of information at train time. We describe a strategy called Learning using Unselected Features (LUFe) that allows selected and unselected features to serve different functions in classification. In this framework, selected features are used directly to set the decision boundary, and unselected features are utilised in a secondary role, with no additional cost at test time. Our empirical results on 49 textual datasets show that LUFe can improve classification performance in comparison with standard wrapper and filter feature selection.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Sussex", "University of Sussex", "Technical University of Dortmund", "University of Sussex", "University of Sussex"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Joseph G.
