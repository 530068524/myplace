{"title": "10 Gbit line rate packet-to-disk using n2disk.", "fields": ["storage area network", "packet analyzer", "timestamping", "network traffic control", "traffic generation model"], "abstract": "Capturing packets to disk at line rate and with high precision packet timestamping is required whenever an evidence of network communications has to be provided. Typical applications of long-term network traffic repositories are network troubleshooting, analysis of security violations, and analysis of high-frequency trading communications. Appliances for 10 Gbit packet capture to disk are often based on dedicated network adapters, and therefore very expensive, making them usable only in specific domains. This paper covers the design and implementation of n2disk, a packet capture to disk application, capable of dumping 10 Gbit traffic to disk using commodity hardware and open-source software. In addition to packet capture, n2disk is able to index the traffic at line-rate during capture, enabling users to efficiently search specific packets in network traffic dump files.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "IIT, Pisa, Italy", "ntop, Pisa, Italy"], "authors": ["Luca Deri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deri:Luca", "Alfredo Cardigliano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cardigliano:Alfredo", "Francesco Fusco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fusco:Francesco"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
