To the best of our knowledge, none of them took the lyric into consideration for melody composition. However, according to some recent studies, within a song, there usually exists a certain extent of correlation between its melody and its lyric. In this demonstration, we propose to utilize this type of correlation information for melody composition. Based on this idea, we design a new melody composition algorithm and develop a melody composer called T-Music which employs this composition algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Cheng Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Cheng", "Raymond Chi-Wing Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Raymond_Chi=Wing", "Raymond Ka Wai Sze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sze:Raymond_Ka_Wai"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
