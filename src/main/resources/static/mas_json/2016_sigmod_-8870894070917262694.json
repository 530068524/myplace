{"title": "iBFS: Concurrent Breadth-First Search on GPUs.", "fields": ["tree traversal", "speedup", "graph traversal", "thread", "bitwise operation"], "abstract": "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a key graph algorithm with many important applications. In this work, we focus on a special class of graph traversal algorithm - concurrent BFS - where multiple breadth-first traversals are performed simultaneously on the same graph. We have designed and developed a new approach called  iBFS  that is able to run i concurrent BFSes from i distinct source vertices, very efficiently on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). iBFS consists of three novel designs. First, iBFS develops a single GPU kernel for  joint traversal  of concurrent BFS to take advantage of shared frontiers across different instances. Second,  outdegree-based GroupBy rules  enables iBFS to selectively run a group of BFS instances which further maximizes the frontier sharing within such a group. Third, iBFS brings additional performance benefit by utilizing highly optimized  bitwise operations  on GPUs, which allows a single GPU thread to inspect a vertex for concurrent BFS instances. The evaluation on a wide spectrum of graph benchmarks shows that iBFS on one GPU runs up to 30x faster than executing BFS instances sequentially, and on 112 GPUs achieves near linear speedup with the maximum performance of 57,267 billion traversed edges per second (TEPS).", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["George Washington University", "George Washington University", "George Washington University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Hang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hang", "H.
