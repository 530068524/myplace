{"title": "Things We Own Together: Sharing Possessions at Home.", "fields": ["digital content", "human computer interaction", "computer science", "interpersonal relationship", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "Sharing is an important facet of human relationships, yet there is a lack of research on how people share ownership of possessions. This paper reports on a study that investi-gates shared ownership of physical and digital possessions through interviews with couples and families in 13 house-holds. We offer a more nuanced definition of shared owner-ship and show that certain practices, which are central to sharing physical objects, are not supported in the sharing of digital content. We suggest potential approaches to address this, focusing in particular on how the sharing of posses-sions plays a role in the building of relationships and is done against a backdrop of trust.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jane Gruning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gruning:Jane", "Si\u00e2n E.
