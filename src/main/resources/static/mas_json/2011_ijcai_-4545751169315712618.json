{"title": "Reasoning and Proofing Services for Semantic Web Agents.", "fields": ["grasp", "interoperability", "common rule", "delegate", "metadata"], "abstract": "The Semantic Web aims to offer an interoperable environment that will allow users to safely delegate complex actions to intelligent agents. Much work has been done for agents' interoperability; especially in the areas of ontology-based metadata and rule-based reasoning. Nevertheless, the SW proof layer has been neglected so far, although it is vital for agents and humans to understand how a result came about, in order to increase the trust in the interchanged information. This paper focuses on the implementation of third party SW reasoning and proofing services wrapped as agents in a multi-agent framework. This way, agents can exchange and justify their arguments without the need to conform to a common rule paradigm. Via external reasoning and proofing services, the receiving agent can grasp the semantics of the received rule set and check the validity of the inferred results.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Aristotle University of Thessaloniki", "University of Crete", "University of Crete", "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Kalliopi Kravari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kravari:Kalliopi", "Constantinos Papatheodorou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papatheodorou:Constantinos", "Grigoris Antoniou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antoniou:Grigoris", "Nick Bassiliades.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bassiliades:Nick"], "pages": 6}
