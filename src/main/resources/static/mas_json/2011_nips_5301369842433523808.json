At each step, the expert executes an evidence gathering test, which suggests the test's relative diagnostic value. We demonstrate that consistency with an expert's test selection leads to non-convex constraints on the model parameters. We incorporate these constraints by augmenting the network with nodes that represent the constraint likelihoods. Gibbs sampling, stochastic hill climbing and greedy search algorithms are proposed to find a MAP estimate that takes into account test ordering constraints and any data available. We demonstrate our approach on diagnostic sessions from a manufacturing scenario.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Intel"], "authors": ["Omar Zia Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Omar_Zia", "Pascal Poupart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poupart:Pascal", "John Mark Agosta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agosta:John_Mark"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
