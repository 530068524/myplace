{"title": "Structuring Interactions for Large-Scale Synchronous Peer Learning.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "structuring", "synchronous learning", "knowledge management", "peer learning"], "abstract": "This research investigates how to introduce synchronous interactive peer learning into an online setting appropriate both for crowdworkers (learning new tasks) and students in massive online courses (learning course material). We present an interaction framework in which groups of learners are formed on demand and then proceed through a sequence of activities that include synchronous group discussion about learner-generated responses. Via controlled experiments with crowdworkers, we show that discussing challenging problems leads to better outcomes than working individually, and incentivizing people to help one another yields still better results. We then show that providing a  mini-lesson  in which workers consider the principles underlying the tested concept and justify their answers leads to further improvements. Combining the mini-lesson with the discussion of the multiple-choice question leads to significant improvements on that question. We also find positive subjective responses to the peer interactions, suggesting that discussions can improve morale in remote work or learning settings.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Derrick Coetzee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coetzee:Derrick", "Seongtaek Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Seongtaek", "Armando Fox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fox:Armando", "Bj\u00f6rn Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartmann:Bj=ouml=rn", "Marti A.
