{"title": "Resource Allocation for Downlink Statistical Multiuser QoS Provisionings in Cellular Wireless Networks.", "fields": ["resource allocation", "cellular network", "fading", "telecommunications link", "network performance"], "abstract": "We propose the adaptive resource allocation schemes for multiuser downlink quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings over broadcast fading channels in time-division (TD) based cellular wireless networks. Specifically, we apply the effective capacity theory to control the service rates with the diverse delay QoS requirements for different mobile users. Subject to the proportional- effective-capacity constraint and the diverse statistical delay-QoS requirements over different downlink users, we formulate the sum effective capacity maximization problem via channel-aware power and time-slot allocation. We decompose the above optimization problem into two sub-problems and then derive the optimal power and time-slot adaptation policy. We also develop a suboptimal scheme called the equal-length TD policy. Simulation results are presented to show the impact of QoS provisionings on the resource allocation across different users and on the network performance.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Qinghe Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Qinghe", "Xi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Xi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
