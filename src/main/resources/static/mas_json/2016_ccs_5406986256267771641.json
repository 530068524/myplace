{"title": "The Honey Badger of BFT Protocols.", "fields": ["transactions per second", "liveness", "byzantine fault tolerance", "honey badger", "atomic broadcast"], "abstract": "The surprising success of cryptocurrencies has led to a surge of interest in deploying large scale, highly robust, Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols for mission-critical applications, such as financial transactions. Although the conventional wisdom is to build atop a (weakly) synchronous protocol such as PBFT (or a variation thereof), such protocols rely critically on network timing assumptions, and only guarantee liveness when the network behaves as expected. We argue these protocols are ill-suited for this deployment scenario. We present an alternative, HoneyBadgerBFT, the first practical asynchronous BFT protocol, which guarantees liveness without making any timing assumptions. We base our solution on a novel atomic broadcast protocol that achieves optimal asymptotic efficiency. We present an implementation and experimental results to show our system can achieve throughput of tens of thousands of transactions per second, and scales to over a hundred nodes on a wide area network. We even conduct BFT experiments over Tor, without needing to tune any parameters. Unlike the alternatives, HoneyBadgerBFT simply does not care about the underlying network.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Andrew Miller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miller:Andrew", "Yu Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia_0005:Yu", "Kyle Croman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Croman:Kyle", "Elaine Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Elaine", "Dawn Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Dawn"], "pages": 12}
