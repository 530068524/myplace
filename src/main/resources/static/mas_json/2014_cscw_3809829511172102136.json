{"title": "Integrating on-demand fact-checking with public dialogue.", "fields": ["deliberation", "sociotechnical system", "value sensitive design", "democracy", "constructive"], "abstract": "Public dialogue plays a key role in democratic society. Such dialogue often contains factual claims, but participants and readers are left wondering what to believe, particularly when contributions to such dialogue come from a broad spectrum of the public. We explore the design space for introducing authoritative information into public dialogue, with the goal of supporting constructive rather than confrontational discourse. We also present a specific design and realization of an archetypal sociotechnical system of this kind, namely an on-demand fact-checking service integrated into a crowdsourced voters guide powered by deliberating citizens. The fact-checking service was co-designed with and staffed by professional librarians. Our evaluation examines the service from the perspectives of both users and librarians.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Seattle Pacific University", "Seattle Public  ... eattle, WA, USA"], "authors": ["Travis Kriplean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kriplean:Travis", "Caitlin Bonnar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonnar:Caitlin", "Alan Borning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borning:Alan", "Bo Kinney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kinney:Bo", "Brian T.
