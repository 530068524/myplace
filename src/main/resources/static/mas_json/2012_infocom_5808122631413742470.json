While routing and scheduling techniques for wireless networks have been studied for decades, network coding is a relatively new technique that allows for an increase in throughput under certain topological and routing conditions. In this work we introduce k-tuple coding, a generalization of pairwise coding with next-hop decodability, and fully characterize the region of arrival rates for which the network queues can be stabilized under this coding strategy. We propose a dynamic control policy for routing, scheduling, and k-tuple coding, and prove that our policy is throughput optimal subject to the k-tuple coding constraint. We provide analytical bounds on the coding gain of our policy, and present numerical results to support our analytical findings. We show that most of the gains are achieved with pairwise coding, and that the coding gain is greater under 2-hop than 1-hop interference. Simulations show that under 2-hop interference our policy yields median throughput gains of 31% beyond optimal scheduling and routing on random topologies with 16 nodes.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Nathaniel M.
