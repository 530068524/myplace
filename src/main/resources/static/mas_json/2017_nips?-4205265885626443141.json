Our generation framework PG$^2$ utilizes the pose information explicitly and consists of two key stages: pose integration and image refinement. In the first stage the condition image and the target pose are fed into a U-Net-like network to generate an initial but coarse image of the person with the target pose. The second stage then refines the initial and blurry result by training a U-Net-like generator in an adversarial way. Extensive experimental results on both 128$\\times$64 re-identification images and 256$\\times$256 fashion photos show that our model generates high-quality person images with convincing details.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Max Planck Society", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "MPI Informatics"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Liqian Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Liqian", "Xu Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Xu", "Qianru Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Qianru", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt", "Tinne Tuytelaars.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuytelaars:Tinne", "Luc Van Gool.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gool:Luc_Van"], "pages": 11}
