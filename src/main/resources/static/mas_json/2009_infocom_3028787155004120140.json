A major challenge in this respect is the VN embedding problem that deals with efficient mapping of virtual nodes and virtual links onto the substrate network resources. Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, previous research focused on designing heuristic-based algorithms which had clear separation between the node mapping and the link mapping phases. This paper proposes VN embedding algorithms with better coordination between the two phases. We formulate the VN em- bedding problem as a mixed integer program through substrate network augmentation. We then relax the integer constraints to obtain a linear program, and devise two VN embedding algo- rithms D-ViNE and R-ViNE using deterministic and randomized rounding techniques, respectively. Simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithms increase the acceptance ratio and the revenue while decreasing the cost incurred by the substrate network in the long run.", "citation": "Citations (848)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["N.
