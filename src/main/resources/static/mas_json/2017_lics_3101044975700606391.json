Somewhat analogously, most proof methods studied therein have focused on greatest fixed-point properties like safety and bisimilarity. Here we make a step towards categorical proof methods for least fixed-point properties over dynamical systems modeled as coalgebras. Concretely, we seek a categorical axiomatization of well-known proof methods for liveness, namely ranking functions (in nondeterministic settings) and ranking supermartingales (in probabilistic ones). We find an answer in a suitable combination of coalgebraic simulation (studied previously by the authors) and corecursive algebra as a classifier for (non-)well-foundedness.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Natsuki Urabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urabe:Natsuki", "Masaki Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hara:Masaki", "Ichiro Hasuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasuo:Ichiro"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
