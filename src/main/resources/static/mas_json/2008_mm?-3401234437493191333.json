This triggered an increasing need of rich visual content in mobile guide applications.   This paper presents two original approaches for using representative visualizations: artistic views which represent an arbitrary deformation made by an artist and perspective views(3D-like) obtained from 3D models. Both approaches are based on learning GPS-to-image relations. We show an efficient use of the thin-plate spline for registering GPS coordinates with images. We also show the implementation of our guiding system on two mobile platforms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse"], "authors": ["Omar Choudary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudary:Omar", "Vincent Charvillat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charvillat:Vincent", "Romulus Grigoras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grigoras:Romulus"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
