The teamwork literature has identified the need to know the capabilities of teammates. How can we integrate the knowledge of another agent\u2019s capabilities for a justifiably intelligent teammate? This paper describes extensions to the cognitive architecture, ACT-R, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science approaches to produce a more cognitively-plausible, autonomous robotic system that \u201cmentally\u201d simulates the decision-making of its teammate. The extensions to ACT-R added capabilities to interact with the real world through the robot\u2019s sensors and effectors and simulate the decision-making of its teammate. The AI applications provided visual sensor capabilities by methods clearly different than those used by humans. The integration of these approaches into intelligent team-based behavior is demonstrated on a mobile robot. Our \u201cTeamBot\u201d matches the descriptive work and theories on human teamwork. We illustrate our approach in a spatial, team-oriented task of a guard force responding appropriately to an alarm condition that requires the human and robot team to \u201cman\u201d two guard stations as soon as possible after the alarm.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["William G.
