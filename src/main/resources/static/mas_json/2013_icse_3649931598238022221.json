{"title": "Practical semantic test simplification.", "fields": ["heuristic", "executable", "computer science", "algorithmic program debugging", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We present a technique that simplifies tests at the semantic level. We first formalize the semantic test simplification problem, and prove it is NP-hard. Then, we propose a heuristic algorithm, SimpleTest, that automatically transforms a test into a simpler test, while still preserving a given property. The key insight of SimpleTest is to reconstruct an executable and simpler test that exhibits the given property from the original one. Our preliminary study on 7 real-world programs showed the usefulness of SimpleTest.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Washington"], "authors": ["Sai Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Sai"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
