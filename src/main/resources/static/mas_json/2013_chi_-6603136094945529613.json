Using a traditional retention and transfer paradigm from the motor learning literature, participants learned four gestures on a touchscreen. The study found that touchscreen gestures transfer, and do so symmetrically. Regardless of the hand used during training, gestures were performed with a comparable level of error and speed by the untrained hand, even after 24 hours. In addition, the form of a gesture, i.e., its length or curvature, was found to have no influence on transferability. These results have important implications for the design of stroke-based gestural interfaces: acquisition could occur with  either hand  and it is possible to  interchange  the hand used to perform gestures. The work concludes with a discussion of these implications and highlights how they can be applied to gesture learning and current gestural systems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Michelle Annett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Annett:Michelle", "Walter F.
