{"title": "Adaptive parametrization of multivariate B-splines for image registration.", "fields": ["regular grid", "control point", "tensor product", "tensor", "spite"], "abstract": "We present an adaptive parametrization scheme for dynamic mesh refinement in the application of parametric image registration. The scheme is based on a refinement measure ensuring that the control points give an efficient representation of the warp fields, in terms of minimizing the registration cost function. In the current work we introduce multivariate B-splines as a novel alternative to the widely used tensor B-splines enabling us to make efficient use of the derived measure.The multivariate B-splines of order n are C n-   1  smooth and are based on Delaunay configurations of arbitrary 2D or 3D control point sets. Efficient algorithms for finding the configurations are presented, and B-splines are through their flexibility shown to feature several advantages over the tensor B-splines. In spite of efforts to make the tensor product B-splines more flexible, the knots are still bound to reside on a regular grid. In contrast, by efficient non- constrained placement of the knots, the multivariate B- splines are shown to give a good representation of inho- mogeneous objects in natural settings. The wide applicability of the method is illustrated through its application on medical data and for optical flow estimation.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michael Sass Hansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hansen:Michael_Sass", "Rasmus Larsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsen:Rasmus", "Ben Glocker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glocker:Ben", "Nassir Navab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navab:Nassir"], "pages": -1}
