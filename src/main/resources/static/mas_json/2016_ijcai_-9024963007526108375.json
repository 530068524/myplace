In this paper, we prove that disjunctive embedded dependencies exactly capture the class of recursively enumerable ontologies in Ontology-based Conjunctive Query Answering (OCQA). Our expressive completeness result does not rely on any built-in linear order on the database. To establish the expressive completeness, we introduce a novel semantic definition for OCQA ontologies. We also show that neither the class of disjunctive tuple-generating dependencies nor the class of embedded dependencies is expressively complete for recursively enumerable OCQA ontologies.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "University of Alberta", "School of Compu ... , Wuhan, China"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Heng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Heng", "Yan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Yan", "Jia-Huai You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Jia=Huai"], "pages": 8}
