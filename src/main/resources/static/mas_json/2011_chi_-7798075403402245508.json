{"title": "Donate for credibility: how contribution incentives can improve credibility.", "fields": ["credibility", "donation", "revenue sharing", "incentive", "user generated content"], "abstract": "This study explores whether certain contribution incentives for online user-generated content can undermine or enhance contributor's credibility. In an online experiment, we found that contributors who are rewarded with donations made in their names are perceived to be more credible than contributors who are financially compensated through revenue-sharing or contribute voluntarily. In addition, disclosing the chosen charity for donation can also impact credibility. Content viewer's self-identification with charity and the congruency between charity and content topic are both factors that may enhance credibility. Our findings lead to practical implications on when and how to use contribution incentives to enhance credibility.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gary Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Gary", "Scott E.
