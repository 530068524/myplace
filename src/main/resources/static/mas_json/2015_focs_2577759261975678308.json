We do so by showing how these cryptographic primitives give rise to a hard computational problem that lies in the complexity class PPAD, for which finding Nash equilibrium is complete. Previous proposals for basing PPAD-hardness on program obfuscation considered a strong \"virtual black-box\" notion that is subject to severe limitations and is unlikely to be realizable for the programs in question. In contrast, for indistinguishability obfuscation no such limitations are known, and recently, several candidate constructions of indistinguishability obfuscation were suggested based on different hardness assumptions on multilinear maps. Our result provides further evidence of the intractability of finding a Nash equilibrium, one that is extrinsic to the evidence presented so far.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Boston University", "Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya"], "authors": ["Nir Bitansky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bitansky:Nir", "Omer Paneth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paneth:Omer", "Alon Rosen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosen:Alon"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 19}
