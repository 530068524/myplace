Conventional multi-label classification techniques are typically not applicable in this situation, because they require explicit enumeration of the label set, which is infeasible in case of structured outputs. Relying on techniques originally designed for single-label structured prediction, in particular structured support vector machines, results in reduced prediction accuracy, or leads to infeasible optimization problems.\n\nIn this work we derive a maximum-margin training formulation for multi-label structured prediction that remains computationally tractable while achieving high prediction accuracy. It also shares most beneficial properties with single-label maximum-margin approaches, in particular formulation as a convex optimization problem, efficient working set training, and PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "authors": ["Christoph H.
