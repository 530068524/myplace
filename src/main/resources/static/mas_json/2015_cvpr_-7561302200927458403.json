Our hypothesis is that while individual kernels estimated using different methods alone are sometimes inadequate, they often complement each other. This paper addresses the problem of fusing multiple kernels estimated using different methods into a more accurate one that can better support image deblurring than each individual kernel. In this paper, we develop a data-driven approach to kernel fusion that learns how each kernel contributes to the final kernel and how they interact with each other. We discuss various kernel fusion models and find that kernel fusion using Gaussian Conditional Random Fields performs best. This Gaussian Conditional Random Fields-based kernel fusion method not only models how individual kernels are fused at each kernel element but also the interaction of kernel fusion among multiple kernel elements. Our experiments show that our method can significantly improve image deblurring by combining kernels from multiple methods into a better one.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Portland State University", "Portland State University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Long Mai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mai:Long", "Feng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0015:Feng"], "pages": 10}
