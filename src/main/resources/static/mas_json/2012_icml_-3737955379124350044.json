{"title": "On the Partition Function and Random Maximum A-Posteriori Perturbations.", "fields": ["partition function", "inference", "maximum a posteriori estimation", "characteristic state function", "partition refinement"], "abstract": "In this paper we relate the partition function to the max-statistics of random variables. In particular, we provide a novel framework for approximating and bounding the partition function using MAP inference on randomly perturbed models. As a result, we can use efficient MAP solvers such as graph-cuts to evaluate the corresponding partition function. We show that our method excels in the typical \"high signal - high coupling\" regime that results in ragged energy landscapes difficult for alternative approaches.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Tamir Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Tamir", "Tommi S.
