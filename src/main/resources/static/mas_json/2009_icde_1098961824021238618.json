The V*-kNN algorithm is based on a safe-region concept called the V*-Diagram. By incrementally maintaining the V*-Diagram, V*-kNN continuously provides accurate MkNN query results and supports dynamically changing values of k. Our approach exploits information regarding the current location of the query point and the search space in addition to the data objects. As a result, the V*-kNN has much smaller IO and computation costs than existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Sarana Nutanong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nutanong:Sarana", "Rui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Rui", "Egemen Tanin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanin:Egemen", "Lars Kulik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulik:Lars"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
