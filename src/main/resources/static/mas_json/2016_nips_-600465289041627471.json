At each iteration, workers asynchronously conduct greedy coordinate descent updates on a block of variables. In the first part of the paper, we analyze the theoretical behavior of Asy-GCD and prove a linear convergence rate. In the second part, we develop an efficient kernel SVM solver based on Asy-GCD in the shared memory multi-core setting. Since our algorithm is fully asynchronous---each core does not need to idle and wait for the other cores---the resulting algorithm enjoys good speedup and outperforms existing multi-core kernel SVM solvers including asynchronous stochastic coordinate descent and multi-core LIBSVM.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Yang You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Yang", "Xiangru Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Xiangru", "Ji Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ji", "Hsiang-Fu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Hsiang=Fu", "Inderjit S.
