Through field observations and interviews, we detail the process and tools used in documenting development for children age three months to five-years-old at one school. Teachers use paper forms and printed photos to record and analyze observations of development. The evolving final product is a paper portfolio of development. This practice relies heavily on the teacher's ability to objectively observe children  in situ , create a record of the activity, and make salient the link between evidence and developmental milestones. We describe current paper and photo documentation practices in light of an online record keeping system that will be introduced at this school within the next year. The present analysis contributes to a growing literature on the role of paper and digital media in documentation.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Anne Marie Piper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piper:Anne_Marie", "Sarah D'Angelo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=Angelo:Sarah", "James D.
