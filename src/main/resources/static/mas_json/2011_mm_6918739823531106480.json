Especially, mixing music clips often effectively improves the expressive quality of video clips. This paper proposes an example-based system for supporting average users in the 3 steps in video remixing: I)video shot sequence creation, II)music clip selection, and III)audio volume adjustment. The proposed system creates a template for a video remix and gives suggestions to users on an interface such as which video clips should be selected to create a video shot sequence and which music clips should be mixed to the created video shot sequence based on professionally created video remix examples. Then, the audio volume of each video shot is automatically adjusted based on its audio content so that the sounds in the video shots and the music clips would not interfere with each other. Experiments have verified that our system was able to create a video shot sequence whose quality was improved equally as the professionally created one by mixing the selected music clips, doubling the subjective scores from 1.7 to 3.7 on a scale of 1-5. Automatic audio volume adjustment improved the subjective scores by approximately 0.5 points on average. Further, the suggestions provided on the interface was evaluated useful by 5 subjects when creating a video remix by selecting 32 video clips and 4 music clips from 265 video clips and 180 music clips.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Naoko Nitta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nitta:Naoko", "Noboru Babaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babaguchi:Noboru"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
