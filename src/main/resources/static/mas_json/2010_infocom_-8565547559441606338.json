Aggregating data at various nodes in the network results in a reduction in the amount of bits transmitted over the network, and hence, saves energy. In this paper, we focus on another important aspect of aggregation, i.e., delay performance. In conjunction with link scheduling, in-network aggregation can reduce the delay by lessening the demands for wireless resources and thus expediting data transmissions. We formulate the problem that minimizes the sum delay of sensed data, and analyze the performance of optimal scheduling with in-network aggregation in tree networks under the node-exclusive interference model. We provide a system wide lower bound on the delay and use it as a benchmark for evaluating different scheduling policies. We numerically evaluate the performance of myopic and non-myopic scheduling policies, where myopic one considers only the current system state for a scheduling decision while non-myopic one simulates future system states. We show that the one-step non-myopic policies can substantially improve the delay performance. In particular, the proposed non-myopic greedy scheduling achieves a good tradeoff between performance and implementability.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Changhee Joo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joo:Changhee", "Jin-Ghoo Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jin=Ghoo", "Ness B.
