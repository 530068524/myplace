{"title": "Journeys & Notes: Designing Social Computing for Non-Places.", "fields": ["software deployment", "social computing", "journaling file system", "urban computing", "destinations"], "abstract": "In this work we present a mobile application we designed and engineered to enable people to log their travels near and far, leave notes behind, and build a community around spaces in between destinations. Our design explores new ground for location-based social computing systems, identifying opportunities where these systems can foster the growth of on-line communities rooted at non-places. In our work we develop, explore, and evaluate several innovative features designed around four usage scenarios: daily commuting, long-distance traveling, quantified traveling, and journaling. We present the results of two small-scale user studies, and one large-scale, world-wide deployment, synthesizing the results as potential opportunities and lessons learned in designing social computing for non-places.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Justin Cranshaw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cranshaw:Justin", "Andr\u00e9s Monroy-Hern\u00e1ndez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monroy=Hern=aacute=ndez:Andr=eacute=s", "S.
