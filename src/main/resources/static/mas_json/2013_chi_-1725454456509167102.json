As digital systems and information become meaningfully parts of people's everyday and social relationships, it is essential to develop new insights about how technology intersects with legacy and inheritance practices. We designed three interactive systems to investigate how digital materials might be passed down in the future. We conducted in-home interviews with ten parents using the systems to provoke discussion about how technology might support or complicate their existing practices. Sessions revealed parents desired to treat their digital information in ways not fully supported by technology. Findings are interpreted to describe design considerations for future work in this emerging space.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Rebecca Gulotta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gulotta:Rebecca", "William Odom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Odom:William", "Jodi Forlizzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forlizzi:Jodi", "Haakon Faste.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faste:Haakon"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
