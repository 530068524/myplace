{"title": "Tight Bounds for Influence in Diffusion Networks and Application to Bond Percolation and Epidemiology.", "fields": ["matrix", "connected component", "spectral radius", "critical value", "percolation"], "abstract": "In this paper, we derive theoretical bounds for the long-term influence of a node in an Independent Cascade Model (ICM). We relate these bounds to the spectral radius of a particular matrix and show that the behavior is sub-critical when this spectral radius is lower than 1. More specifically, we point out that, in general networks, the sub-critical regime behaves in O(\u221an) where n is the size of the network, and that this upper bound is met for star-shaped networks. We apply our results to epidemiology and percolation on arbitrary networks, and derive a bound for the critical value beyond which a giant connected component arises. Finally, we show empirically the tightness of our bounds for a large family of networks.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["R\u00e9mi Lemonnier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lemonnier:R=eacute=mi", "Kevin Scaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scaman:Kevin", "Nicolas Vayatis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vayatis:Nicolas"], "pages": 9}
