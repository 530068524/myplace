{"title": "A Propagator Design Framework for Constraints over Sequences.", "fields": ["operator", "conceptual framework", "propagator", "notation", "tuple"], "abstract": "Constraints over variable sequences are ubiquitous and many of their propagators have been inspired by dynamic programming (DP). We propose a conceptual framework for designing such propagators: pruning rules, in a functional notation, are refined upon the application of transformation operators to a DP-style formulation of a constraint; a representation of the (tuple) variable domains is picked; and a control of the pruning rules is picked.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "Uppsala University"], "authors": ["Jean-No\u00ebl Monette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monette:Jean=No=euml=l", "Pierre Flener.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flener:Pierre", "Justin Pearson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pearson:Justin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
