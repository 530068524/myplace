{"title": "Guaranteed Delivery for Geographical Anycasting in Wireless Multi-Sink Sensor and Sensor-Actor Networks.", "fields": ["tree traversal", "network packet", "key distribution in wireless sensor networks", "hop", "sink"], "abstract": "In the anycasting problem, a sensor wants to report event information to one of sinks or actors. We describe the first localized anycasting algorithms that guarantee delivery for connected multi-sink sensor-actor networks. Let $S(x)$ be the closest actor/sink to sensor $x$, and $|xS(x)|$ be distance between them. In greedy phase, a node $s$ forwards the packet to its neighbor $v$ that minimizes the ratio of cost $cost(|sv|)$ of sending packet to $v$ (here we specifically apply hop-count and power consumption metrics) over the reduction in distance ($|sS(s)|-|vS(v)|$) to the closest actor/sink. A variant is to forward to the first neighbor on the shortest weighted path toward $v$. If none of neighbors reduces that distance then recovery mode is invoked. It is done by face traversal toward the nearest connected actor/sink, where edges are replaced by paths optimizing given cost. A hop count based and two variants of localized power aware anycasting algorithms are described. We prove guaranteed delivery property analytically and experimentally.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Ottawa"], "authors": ["Nathalie Mitton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitton:Nathalie", "David Simplot-Ryl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simplot=Ryl:David", "Ivan Stojmenovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stojmenovic:Ivan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
