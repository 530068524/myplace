{"title": "Pushing the limits of accelerator efficiency while retaining programmability.", "fields": ["computation", "generality", "speedup", "scaling", "computer science", "concurrency", "parallel computing"], "abstract": "The waning benefits of device scaling have caused a push towards domain specific accelerators (DSAs), which sacrifice programmability for efficiency. While providing huge benefits, DSAs are prone to obsoletion due to domain volatility, have recurring design and verification costs, and have large area footprints when multiple DSAs are required in a single device. Because of the benefits of generality, this work explores how far a programmable architecture can be pushed, and whether it can come close to the performance, energy, and area efficiency of a DSA-based approach. Our insight is that DSAs employ common specialization principles for concurrency, computation, communication, data-reuse and coordination, and that these same principles can be exploited in a programmable architecture using a composition of known microarchitectural mechanisms. Specifically, we propose and study an architecture called LSSD, which is composed of many low-power and tiny cores, each having a configurable spatial architecture, scratchpads, and DMA. Our results show that a programmable, specialized architecture can indeed be competitive with a domain-specific approach. Compared to four prominent and diverse DSAs, LSSD can match the DSAs' 10\u00d7 to 150\u00d7 speedup over an OOO core, with only up to 4x more area and power than a single DSA, while retaining programmability.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Qualcomm"], "authors": ["Tony Nowatzki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nowatzki:Tony", "Vinay Gangadhar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gangadhar:Vinay", "Karthikeyan Sankaralingam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankaralingam:Karthikeyan", "Greg Wright.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wright:Greg"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
