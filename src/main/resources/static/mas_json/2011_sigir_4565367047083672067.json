{"title": "Mining topics on participations for community discovery.", "fields": ["hierarchical dirichlet process", "linked data", "data mining", "data science", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Community discovery on large-scale linked document corpora has been a hot research topic for decades. There are two types of links. The first one, which we call d2d-link, indicates connectiveness among different documents, such as blog references and research paper citations. The other one, which we call u2u-link, represents co-occurrences or simultaneous participations of different users in one document and typically each document from u2u-link corpus has more than one user/author. Examples of u2u-link data covers email archives and research paper co-authorship networks. Community discovery in d2d-link data has achieved much success, while methods for that in u2u-link data either make no use of the textual content of the documents or make oversimplified assumptions about the users and the textual content. In this paper we propose a general approach of community discovery for u2u-link data, i.e., multiple user data, by placing topical variables on multiple authors' participations in documents. Experiments on a research proceeding co-authorship corpus and a New York Times news corpus show the effectiveness of our model.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Guoqing Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Guoqing", "Jinwen Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jinwen", "Lichun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Lichun", "Shengliang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Shengliang", "Shenghua Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Shenghua", "Zhong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Zhong", "Dingyi Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Dingyi", "Yong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yong"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
