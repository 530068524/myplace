{"title": "Zero-Shot Transfer Learning for Event Extraction.", "fields": ["small set", "framenet", "complex event processing", "transfer of learning", "annotation"], "abstract": "Most previous event extraction studies have relied heavily on features derived from annotated event mentions, thus cannot be applied to new event types without annotation effort. In this work, we take a fresh look at event extraction and model it as a grounding problem. We design a transferable neural architecture, mapping event mentions and types jointly into a shared semantic space using structural and compositional neural networks, where the type of each event mention can be determined by the closest of all candidate types . By leveraging (1)~available manual annotations for a small set of existing event types and (2)~existing event ontologies, our framework applies to new event types without requiring additional annotation. Experiments on both existing event types (e.g., ACE, ERE) and new event types (e.g., FrameNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. \\textit{Without any manual annotations} for 23 new event types, our zero-shot framework achieved performance comparable to a state-of-the-art supervised model which is trained from the annotations of 500 event mentions.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "New York University", "Bar-Ilan University", "University College London"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ido Dagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagan:Ido", "Heng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Heng", "Clare R.
