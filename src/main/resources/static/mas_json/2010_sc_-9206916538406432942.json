{"title": "Scalable Identification of Load Imbalance in Parallel Executions Using Call Path Profiles.", "fields": ["spmd", "instruction set", "profiling", "wait", "petascale computing"], "abstract": "Applications must scale well to make efficient use of today's class of petascale computers, which contain hundreds of thousands of processor cores. Inefficiencies that do not even appear in modest-scale executions can become major bottlenecks in large-scale executions. Because scaling problems are often difficult to diagnose, there is a critical need for scalable tools that guide scientists to the root causes of scaling problems. Load imbalance is one of the most common scaling problems. To provide actionable insight into load imbalance, we present post-mortem parallel analysis techniques for pinpointing and quantifying load imbalance in the context of call path profiles of parallel programs. We show how to identify load imbalance in its static and dynamic context by using only low-overhead asynchronous call path profiling to locate regions of code responsible for communication wait time in SPMD executions. We describe the implementation of these techniques within HPCTOOLKIT.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Nathan R.
