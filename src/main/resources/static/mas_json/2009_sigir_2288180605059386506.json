NERQ is potentially useful in many applications in web search. The paper proposes taking a probabilistic approach to the task using query log data and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We consider contexts of a named entity (i.e., the remainders of the named entity in queries) as words of a document, and classes of the named entity as topics. The topic model is constructed by a novel and general learning method referred to as WS-LDA (Weakly Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation), which employs weakly supervised learning (rather than unsupervised learning) using partially labeled seed entities. Experimental results show that the proposed method based on WS-LDA can accurately perform NERQ, and outperform the baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (292)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Microsoft", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigir", "authors": ["Jiafeng Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jiafeng", "Gu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Gu", "Xueqi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xueqi", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Hang"], "pages": 8}
