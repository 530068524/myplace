The key idea in segment routing is to break up the routing path into segments in order to enable better network utilization. Segment routing also enables finer control of the routing paths and can be used to route traffic through middle boxes. This paper considers the problem of determining the optimal parameters for segment routing in the offline and online cases. We develop a traffic matrix oblivious algorithm for robust segment routing in the offline case and a competitive algorithm for online segment routing. We also show that both these algorithms work well in practice.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Randeep Bhatia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatia:Randeep", "Fang Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Fang", "Murali S.
