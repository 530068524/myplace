{"title": "Task-Driven Dynamic Fusion: Reducing Ambiguity in Video Description.", "fields": ["fusion", "closed captioning", "concatenation", "ambiguity", "channel"], "abstract": "Integrating complementary features from multiple channels is expected to solve the description ambiguity problem in video captioning, whereas inappropriate fusion strategies often harm rather than help the performance. Existing static fusion methods in video captioning such as concatenation and summation cannot attend to appropriate feature channels, thus fail to adaptively support the recognition of various kinds of visual entities such as actions and objects. This paper contributes to: 1)The first in-depth study of the weakness inherent in data-driven static fusion methods for video captioning. 2) The establishment of a task-driven dynamic fusion (TDDF) method. It can adaptively choose different fusion patterns according to model status. 3) The improvement of video captioning. Extensive experiments conducted on two well-known benchmarks demonstrate that our dynamic fusion method outperforms the state-of-the-art results on MSVD with METEOR scores 0.333, and achieves superior METEOR scores 0.278 on MSR-VTT-10K. Compared to single features, the relative improvement derived from our fusion method are 10.0% and 5.7% respectively on two datasets.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xishan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xishan", "Ke Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Ke", "Yongdong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yongdong", "Dongming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dongming", "Jintao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jintao", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi"], "pages": 9}
