Traditional approaches rely on centralized, server-based communication architectures, which raises scalability and privacy concerns. To address these problems, we proposed OverDrive, an overlay-based geocast service that is applicable in smart traffic scenarios and not prone to the shortcomings of centralized designs. Here, we present an interactive demonstrator of the OverDrive protocol that visualizes OverDrive's neighborhood structures and routing approach in a realistic and highly mobile traffic scenario. Our demonstrator is realized as an extension to the overlay simulation framework OverSim.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Martin Florian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Florian:Martin", "Simeon Andreev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andreev:Simeon", "Ingmar Baumgart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baumgart:Ingmar"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
