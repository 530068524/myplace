Unlike earlier algorithms with this property (e.g., Spherical LSH [1, 2]), our algorithm is also practical, improving upon the well-studied hyperplane LSH [3] in practice. We also introduce a multiprobe version of this algorithm and conduct an experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data sets.\n\nWe complement the above positive results with a fine-grained lower bound for the quality of any LSH family for angular distance. Our lower bound implies that the above LSH family exhibits a trade-off between evaluation time and quality that is close to optimal for a natural class of LSH functions.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alexandr Andoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andoni:Alexandr", "Piotr Indyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Indyk:Piotr", "Thijs Laarhoven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laarhoven:Thijs", "Ilya P.
