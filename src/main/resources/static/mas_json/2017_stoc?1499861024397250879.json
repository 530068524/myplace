{"title": "Beating 1-1/e for ordered prophets.", "fields": ["beat", "conjecture", "arbitrarily large", "inequality", "secretary problem"], "abstract": "Hill and Kertz studied the  prophet inequality  on iid distributions [ The Annals of Probability 1982 ]. They proved a theoretical bound of 1 \u00e2   1/ e  on the approximation factor of their algorithm. They conjectured that the best approximation factor for arbitrarily large  n  is 1/1+1/ e \u00e2   0.731. This conjecture remained open prior to this paper for over 30 years. In this paper we present a threshold-based algorithm for the prophet inequality with  n  iid distributions. Using a nontrivial and novel approach we show that our algorithm is a 0.738-approximation algorithm. By beating the bound of 1/1+1/ e , this refutes the conjecture of Hill and Kertz. Moreover, we generalize our results to non-uniform distributions and discuss its applications in mechanism design.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Cornell University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Melika Abolhassani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abolhassani:Melika", "Soheil Ehsani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ehsani:Soheil", "Hossein Esfandiari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esfandiari:Hossein", "MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hajiaghayi:MohammadTaghi", "Robert D.
