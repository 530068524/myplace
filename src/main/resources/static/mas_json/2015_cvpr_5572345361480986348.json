{"title": "3D scanning deformable objects with a single RGBD sensor.", "fields": ["bundle adjustment", "closure", "ground truth", "deformation", "computer vision"], "abstract": "We present a 3D scanning system for deformable objects that uses only a single Kinect sensor. Our work allows considerable amount of nonrigid deformations during scanning, and achieves high quality results without heavily constraining user or camera motion. We do not rely on any prior shape knowledge, enabling general object scanning with freeform deformations. To deal with the drift problem when nonrigidly aligning the input sequence, we automatically detect loop closures, distribute the alignment error over the loop, and finally use a bundle adjustment algorithm to optimize for the latent 3D shape and nonrigid deformation parameters simultaneously. We demonstrate high quality scanning results in some challenging sequences, comparing with state of art nonrigid techniques, as well as ground truth data.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Microsoft", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mingsong Dou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dou:Mingsong", "Jonathan Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Jonathan", "Henry Fuchs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuchs:Henry", "Andrew W.
