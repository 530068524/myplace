{"title": "Beyond Spectral Clustering - Tight Relaxations of Balanced Graph Cuts.", "fields": ["spectral clustering", "initialization", "cut", "normalization", "graph partition"], "abstract": "Spectral clustering is based on the spectral relaxation of the normalized/ratio graph cut criterion. While the spectral relaxation is known to be loose, it has been shown recently that a non-linear eigenproblem yields a tight relaxation of the Cheeger cut. In this paper, we extend this result considerably by providing a characterization of all balanced graph cuts which allow for a tight relaxation. Although the resulting optimization problems are non-convex and non-smooth, we provide an efficient first-order scheme which scales to large graphs. Moreover, our approach comes with the quality guarantee that given any partition as initialization the algorithm either outputs a better partition or it stops immediately.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "authors": ["Matthias Hein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hein_0001:Matthias", "Simon Setzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Setzer:Simon"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
