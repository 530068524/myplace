{"title": "On approximating functions of the singular values in a stream.", "fields": ["matrix norm", "integer", "singular value", "real number", "binary logarithm"], "abstract": "For any real number  p  > 0, we nearly completely characterize the space complexity of estimating || A ||  p    p   = \u2211  i =1   n   \u03c3  i    p   for  n  \u00d7  n  matrices  A  in which each row and each column has  O (1) non-zero entries and whose entries are presented one at a time in a data stream model. Here the \u03c3  i   are the singular values of  A , and when  p  \u2265 1, || A ||  p    p   is the  p -th power of the Schatten  p -norm. We show that when  p  is not an even integer, to obtain a (1+\u0454)-approximation to || A ||  p    p   with constant probability, any 1-pass algorithm requires  n  1\u2212 g (\u0454)  bits of space, where  g (\u0454) \u2192 0 as \u0454 \u2192 0 and \u0454 > 0 is a constant independent of  n . However, when  p  is an even integer, we give an upper bound of  n  1\u22122/ p   (\u0454 \u22121 log n ) bits of space, which holds even in the turnstile data stream model. The latter is optimal up to (\u0454 \u22121  log n ) factors.   Our results considerably strengthen lower bounds in previous work for arbitrary (not necessarily sparse) matrices  A : the previous best lower bound was \u03a9(log n ) for  p \u2208 (0,1), \u03a9( n  1/ p \u22121/2 /log n ) for  p \u2208 [1,2) and \u03a9( n  1\u22122/ p  ) for  p \u2208 (2,\u221e). We note for  p  \u2208 (2, \u221e), while our lower bound for even integers is the same, for other  p  in this range our lower bound is  n  1\u2212 g (\u0454) , which is considerably stronger than the previous  n  1\u22122/ p   for small enough constant \u0454 > 0. We obtain similar near-linear lower bounds for Ky-Fan norms, eigenvalue shrinkers, and M-estimators, many of which could have been solvable in logarithmic space prior to our work.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Facebook", "IBM"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0002:Yi", "David P.
