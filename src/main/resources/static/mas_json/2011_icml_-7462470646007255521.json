We propose a rotation-based algorithm to compute this left-stochastic decomposition (LSD). Theoretical results link the LSD clustering method to a soft kernel k-means clustering, give conditions for when the factorization and clustering are unique, and provide error bounds. Experimental results on simulated and real similarity datasets show that the proposed method reliably provides accurate clusterings.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Raman Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Raman", "Maya R.
