{"title": "PANDAA: physical arrangement detection of networked devices through ambient-sound awareness.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "multilateration", "software deployment", "meter", "ambient noise level"], "abstract": "Future ubiquitous home environments can contain 10s or 100s of devices. Ubiquitous services running on these devices (i.e. localizing users, routing, security algorithms) will commonly require an accurate location of each device. In order to obtain these locations, existing techniques require either a manual survey, active sound sources, or estimation using wireless radios. These techniques, however, need additional hardware capabilities and are intrusive to the user. Non-intrusive, automatic localization of ubiquitous computing devices in the home has the potential to greatly facilitate device deployments.   This paper presents the PANDAA system, a zero-configuration spatial localization system for networked devices based on ambient sound sensing. After initial placement of the devices, ambient sounds, such as human speech, music, foot- steps, finger snaps, hand claps, or coughs and sneezes, are used to autonomously resolve the spatial relative arrangement of devices using trigonometric bounds and successive approximation. Using only time difference of arrival measurements as a bound for successive estimations, PANDAA is able to achieve an average of 0.17 meter accuracy for device location in the meeting room deployment.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Independant, Mo ... n View, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Zheng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Zheng", "Aveek Purohit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Purohit:Aveek", "Kaifei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kaifei", "Shijia Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Shijia", "Trevor Pering.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pering:Trevor", "Pei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Pei"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
