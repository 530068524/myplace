The question is whether the relation  R                     0  is primitive positive definable from  R                     1 , \u2026,  R n                     , i.e., definable by a first-order formula that uses only relation symbols for  R                     1 , \u2026,  R n                     , equality, conjunctions, and existential quantification (disjunction, negation, and universal quantification are forbidden).                  We show decidability of this problem for all structures \u0393 that have a first-order definition in an ordered homogeneous structure \u0394 with a finite relational signature whose age is a Ramsey class and determined by finitely many forbidden substructures. Examples of structures \u0393 with this property are the order of the rationals, the random graph, the homogeneous universal poset, the random tournament, all homogeneous universal  C -relations, and many more. We also obtain decidability of the problem when we replace primitive positive definability by existential positive, or existential definability. Our proof makes use of universal algebraic and model theoretic concepts, Ramsey theory, and a recent characterization of Ramsey classes in topological dynamics.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9quipe de Logiq ... n.ac.at/pinsker", "\u00c9quipe de Logiq ... ussieu.fr~todor", "Equipe de Logiq ... , Paris, France", "Equipe de Logiq ... , Paris, France"], "authors": ["Manuel Bodirsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodirsky:Manuel", "Michael Pinsker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinsker:Michael", "Todor Tsankov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsankov:Todor"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2011", "pages": 8}
