This is a fundamental problem in various fields, including spatial databases and computational geometry. In this paper we provide a number of improvements for three and higher dimensional orthogonal range reporting: In the pointer machine model, we improve all the best previous results, some of which have not seen any improvements in almost two decades. In the I/O-model, we improve the previously known three-dimensional structures and provide the first (non-trivial) structures for four and higher dimensions.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University"], "authors": ["Peyman Afshani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Afshani:Peyman", "Lars Arge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arge:Lars", "Kasper Dalgaard Larsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsen:Kasper_Dalgaard"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
