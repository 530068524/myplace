As such, much effort has been made in realistic modeling of plants. As the trend moves towards networked and distributed virtual environment, however, the current models are inadequate as they are not designed for progressive transmissions. In this paper, we fill in this gap by proposing a progressive representation for plants based on generalized cylinders. To facilitate the transmission of the plants, we quantify the visual contribution of each branch and use this weight in packet scheduling. We show the efficiency of our representations and effectiveness of our packet scheduler through simulations.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Toulouse", "National University of Singapore", "University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "CIRAD, Montpellier, France"], "authors": ["Sebastien Mondet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mondet:Sebastien", "Wei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wei", "G\u00e9raldine Morin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morin:G=eacute=raldine", "Romulus Grigoras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grigoras:Romulus", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boudon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boudon:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Wei Tsang Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Wei_Tsang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
