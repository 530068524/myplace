Compute clusters are relatively easy to create and use, but tools to effectively share cluster resources are lacking.  CloudAlloc  addresses this problem and schedules workloads to cluster resources using allocation algorithms that can be easily changed according to the objectives of the enterprise. It also monitors resource utilization and thus, provides accountability for actual usage.  CloudAlloc  is a lightweight, flexible, easy-to-use tool for cluster resource allocation that has also proved useful as a research platform. We demonstrate its features and also discuss its allocation algorithms that minimize power usage.  CloudAlloc  was implemented and is in use at HP Labs.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Trento", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of Trento", "Hewlett-Packard", "Nou Data, Palo Alto, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Enrico Iori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iori:Enrico", "Alkis Simitsis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simitsis:Alkis", "Themis Palpanas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palpanas:Themis", "Kevin Wilkinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilkinson:Kevin", "Stavros Harizopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harizopoulos:Stavros"], "pages": 4}
