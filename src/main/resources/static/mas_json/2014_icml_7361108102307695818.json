Previous attempts to use information theory to define clusters in an assumption-free way are based on maximizing mutual information between data and cluster labels. We demonstrate that this intuition suffers from a fundamental conceptual flaw that causes clustering performance to deteriorate as the amount of data increases. Instead, we return to the axiomatic foundations of information theory to define a meaningful clustering measure based on the notion of consistency under coarse-graining for finite data.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Information Sciences Institute", "University of Southern California", "Information Sciences Institute", "University of Southern California", "Indiana University", "Santa Fe Institute"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Greg Ver Steeg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steeg:Greg_Ver", "Aram Galstyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galstyan:Aram", "Fei Sha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sha:Fei", "Simon DeDeo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeDeo:Simon"], "pages": 9}
