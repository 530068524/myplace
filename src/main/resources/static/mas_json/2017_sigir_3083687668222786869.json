{"title": "Predictive Network Representation Learning for Link Prediction.", "fields": ["data mining", "unified model", "machine learning", "feature learning", "sampling"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a predictive network representation learning (PNRL) model to solve the structural link prediction problem. The proposed model defines two learning objectives, i.e., observed structure preservation and hidden link prediction. To integrate the two objectives in a unified model, we develop an effective sampling strategy to select certain edges in a given network as assumed hidden links and regard the rest network structure as observed when training the model. By jointly optimizing the two objectives, the model can not only enhance the predictive ability of node representations but also learn additional link prediction knowledge in the representation space. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the other popular and state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Zhitao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhitao", "Chengyao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chengyao", "Wenjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenjie"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
