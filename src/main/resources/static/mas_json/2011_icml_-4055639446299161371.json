{"title": "On the Integration of Topic Modeling and Dictionary Learning.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "k svd", "inference", "topic model", "bayesian inference"], "abstract": "A new nonparametric Bayesian model is developed to integrate dictionary learning and topic model into a unified framework. The model is employed to analyze partially annotated images, with the dictionary learning performed directly on image patches. Efficient inference is performed with a Gibbsslice sampler, and encouraging results are reported on widely used datasets.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "University of Minnesota", "Duke University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Lingbo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Lingbo", "Mingyuan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Mingyuan", "Guillermo Sapiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sapiro:Guillermo", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "pages": 8}
