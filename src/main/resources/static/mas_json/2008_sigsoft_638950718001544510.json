We show how existing discrete-event system (DES) theory can be successfully applied to this problem. From code without concurrency controls and a specification of desired behaviours, concurrency control code is generated. By applying rigorously proven DES theory, we guarantee that the control scheme is nonblocking (and thus free of both deadlock and livelock) and minimally restrictive. Some conflicts between specifications and source can be automatically resolved without introducing new specifications. Moreover, the approach is independent of specific programming or specification languages. Two examples using Java are presented to illustrate the approach. Additional applicable DES results are discussed as future work.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Queen's University", "Queen's University", "Queen's University"], "authors": ["Christopher Dragert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dragert:Christopher", "J\u00fcrgen Dingel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dingel:J=uuml=rgen", "Karen Rudie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudie:Karen"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
