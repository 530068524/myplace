{"title": "THink: Inferring Cognitive Status from Subtle Behaviors.", "fields": ["neuropsychology", "cognition", "machine learning", "computer science", "simulation", "artificial intelligence", "digital clock"], "abstract": "The digital clock drawing test is a fielded application that provides a major advance over existing neuropsychological testing technology. It captures and analyzes high precision information about both outcome and process, opening up the possibility of detecting subtle cognitive impairment even when test results appear superficially normal. We describe the design and development of the test, document the role of AI in its capabilities, and report on its use over the past seven years. We outline its potential implications for earlier detection and treatment of neurological disorders. We set the work in the larger context of the THink project, which is exploring multiple approaches to determining cognitive status through the detection and analysis of subtle behaviors.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Drexel University", "Boston University", "Lahey Hospital & Medical Center", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Drexel University", "Boston University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Kytheram", "Department of N ... , Lahey Health"], "authors": ["Randall Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Randall", "David J.
