Most existing approaches tackle the extraction of opinion entities and opinion relations in a pipelined manner, where the interdependencies among different extraction stages are not captured. We propose a joint inference model that leverages knowledge from predictors that optimize subtasks of opinion extraction, and seeks a globally optimal solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our joint inference approach significantly outperforms traditional pipeline methods and baselines that tackle subtasks in isolation for the problem of opinion extraction.", "citation": "Citations (120)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Bishan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Bishan", "Claire Cardie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cardie:Claire"], "pages": 10}
