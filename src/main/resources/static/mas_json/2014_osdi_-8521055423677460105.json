{"title": "Fast Databases with Fast Durability and Recovery Through Multicore Parallelism.", "fields": ["multi core processor", "raid", "database transaction", "crash", "online transaction processing"], "abstract": "Multicore in-memory databases for modern machines can support extraordinarily high transaction rates for online transaction processing workloads. A potential weakness, however, is recovery from crash failures. Can classical techniques, such as checkpoints, be made both efficient enough to keep up with current systems' memory sizes and transaction rates, and smart enough to avoid additional contention? Starting from an efficient multicore database system, we show that naive logging and checkpoints make normal-case execution slower, but that frequent disk synchronization allows us to keep up with many workloads with only a modest reduction in throughput. We design throughout for parallelism: during logging, during checkpointing, and during recovery. The result is fast. Given appropriate hardware (three SSDs and a RAID), a 32-core system can recover a 43.2 GB key-value database in 106 seconds, and a > 70 GB TPC-C database in 211 seconds.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Wenting Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Wenting", "Stephen Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Stephen", "Eddie Kohler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohler:Eddie", "Barbara Liskov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liskov:Barbara"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2014", "pages": 13}
