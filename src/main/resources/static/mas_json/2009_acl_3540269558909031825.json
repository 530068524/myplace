{"title": "The Chinese Aspect Generation Based on Aspect Selection Functions.", "fields": ["computer science", "expression", "artificial intelligence", "semantics", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "This paper describes our system for generating Chinese aspect expressions. In the system, the semantics of different aspects is characterized by specific temporal and conceptual features. The semantic applicability conditions of each individual aspect are theoretically represented by an aspect selection function (ASF). The generation is realized by evaluating implemented inquiries which formally define the ASFs, traversing the grammatical network, and making aspect selections.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Social Sciences", "University of Bremen"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Guowen Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Guowen", "John A.
