Test automation, a potential way to reduce testing cost, has received enormous research attention recently, but the so-called \u201coracle problem\u201d (how to decide the PASS/FAIL outcome of a test execution) is still a major obstacle to such cost reduction. We have extensively investigated state-of-the-art works that contribute to address this problem, from areas such as specification mining and model inference. In this paper, we compare three types of automated oracles: Data invariants, Temporal invariants, and Finite State Automata. More specifically, we study the training cost and the false positive rate; we evaluate also their fault detection capability. Seven medium to large, industrial application subjects and real faults have been used in our empirical investigation.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler"], "authors": ["Cu D.
