{"title": "Weakly Supervised Semantic Parsing with Abstract Examples.", "fields": ["top down parsing", "parser combinator", "s attributed grammar", "bottom up parsing", "top down parsing language"], "abstract": "Semantic parsers translate language utterances to programs, but are often trained from utterance-denotation pairs only. Consequently, parsers must overcome the problem of spuriousness at training time, where an incorrect program found at search time accidentally leads to a correct denotation. We propose that in small well-typed domains, we can semi-automatically generate an abstract representation for examples that facilitates information sharing across examples. This alleviates spuriousness, as the probability of randomly obtaining a correct answer from a program decreases across multiple examples. We test our approach on CNLVR, a challenging visual reasoning dataset, where spuriousness is central because denotations are either TRUE or FALSE, and thus random programs have high probability of leading to a correct denotation. We develop the first semantic parser for this task and reach 83.5% accuracy, a 15.7% absolute accuracy improvement compared to the best reported accuracy so far.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jonathan Berant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berant:Jonathan", "Amir Globerson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Globerson:Amir", "Omer Goldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldman:Omer", "Veronica Latcinnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Latcinnik:Veronica", "Ehud Nave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nave:Ehud"], "pages": 11}
