{"title": "Identifying news videos' ideological perspectives using emphatic patterns of visual concepts.", "fields": ["ideology", "politics", "social issues", "broadcasting", "viewpoints"], "abstract": "Television news has become the predominant way of understanding the world around us, but individual news broadcasters can frame or mislead an audience's understanding of political and social issues. We are developing a computer system that can automatically identify highly biased television news and encourage audiences to seek news stories from contrasting viewpoints. But can computers identify the ideological perspective from which a news video was produced? We propose a method based on an empathic pattern of visual concepts: news broadcasters holding contrasting ideological beliefs appear to emphasize different subsets of visual concepts. We formalize the emphatic patterns and propose a statistical model. We evaluate the proposed model on a large broadcast news video archive with promising experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Wei-Hao Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Wei=Hao", "Alexander G.
