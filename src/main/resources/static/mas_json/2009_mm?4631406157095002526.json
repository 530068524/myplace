Our hypothesis is that, given a large enough dataset of images with geo-based metadata, clusters of matching images from that dataset tend to provide reliable cues as to what the popular tourist spots may be. Our algorithm takes the geographical area of interest as input and retrieves geotagged photos from online photo collections. By clustering the photos based on their locations and identifying the popular tags for each cluster, our algorithm generates a set of points of interest (POIs) for the area. After retrieving additional photos based on these discovered POI tags, we use image matching to find the most representative landmark view for each POI. Finally, we remove clutter from the representative image and apply tooning to generate a map icon for each landmark.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "departments": ["Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "SDI Corporation ... a 50087, Taiwan"], "authors": ["Wei-Chao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wei=Chao", "Agathe Battestini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Battestini:Agathe", "Natasha Gelfand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelfand:Natasha", "Vidya Setlur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Setlur:Vidya"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
