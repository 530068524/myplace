This paper addresses the current limitations by developing  SDQuery DSI , a GridFTP plug-in that supports flexible server-side data subsetting. An existing GridFTP server is able to dynamically load this tool to support new functionality. Different queries types (query over dimensions, coordinates and values) are supported by our tool. A number of optimizations, like parallel indexing, performance model for data subsetting, and parallel streaming are also applied. We compare our  SDQuery DSI  with GridFTP default  File DSI  in different network environments, and show that our method can achieve better efficiency in almost all cases.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["Yu Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su_0011:Yu", "Yi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yi", "Gagan Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Gagan", "Rajkumar Kettimuthu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kettimuthu:Rajkumar"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
