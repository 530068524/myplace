Our contribution is two-fold. First, we extend the refinement type system framework employed in the recent work on (incomplete) automated higher-order verification by drawing on the classical work on relatively complete \"Hoare logic like\" program logic for higher-order procedural languages. Then, by adopting the recently proposed techniques for solving constraints over quantified first-order logic formulas, we develop an automated type inference method for the type system, thereby realizing an automated relatively complete verification of higher-order programs.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "Nagoya University", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Hiroshi Unno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unno_0001:Hiroshi", "Tachio Terauchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terauchi:Tachio", "Naoki Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi_0001:Naoki"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
