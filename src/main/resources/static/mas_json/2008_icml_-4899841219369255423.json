Unfortunately, testing  \u03b8 -subsumption is NP-complete, which represents a crucial efficiency bottleneck for many relational learners. In this paper, we present a probabilistic estimator of clause coverage, based on a randomized restarted search strategy. Under a distribution assumption, our algorithm can estimate clause coverage without having to decide subsumption for all examples. We implement this algorithm in program ReCovEr. On generated graph data and real-world datasets, we show that ReCovEr provides reasonably accurate estimates while achieving dramatic runtimes improvements compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ondrej Kuzelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzelka:Ondrej", "Filip Zelezn\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zelezn=yacute=:Filip"], "pages": 8}
