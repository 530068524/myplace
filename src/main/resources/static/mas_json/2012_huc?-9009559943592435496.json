To reach this end, InCense provides a GUI and an interactive ontology to enable users to define the configuration of the sensing application, i.e. what sensing components to add, and the flow of the sensing session. We illustrate the ease of use of the InCense platform through a scenario in which both opportunistic and participatory sensing paradigms are used.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Baja California", "Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education", "Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education", "Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education", "Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education"], "authors": ["Marcela D.
