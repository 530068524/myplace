{"title": "MaSM: efficient online updates in data warehouses.", "fields": ["real time computing", "cache", "throughput", "joins", "data warehouse"], "abstract": "Data warehouses have been traditionally optimized for read-only query performance, allowing only offline updates at night, essentially trading off data freshness for performance. The need for 24x7 operations in global markets and the rise of online and other quickly-reacting businesses make concurrent online updates increasingly desirable. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art approaches fall short of supporting fast analysis queries over fresh data. The conventional approach of performing updates in place can dramatically slow down query performance, while prior proposals using differential updates either require large in-memory buffers or may incur significant update migration cost.   This paper presents a novel approach for supporting online updates in data warehouses that overcomes the limitations of prior approaches, by making judicious use of available SSDs to cache incoming updates. We model the problem of query processing with differential updates as a type of outer join between the data residing on disks and the updates residing on SSDs. We present MaSM algorithms for performing such joins and periodic migrations, with small memory footprints, low query overhead, low SSD writes, efficient in-place migration of updates, and correct ACID support. Our experiments show that MaSM incurs only up to 7% overhead both on synthetic range scans (varying range size from 100GB to 4KB) and in a TPC-H query replay study, while also increasing the update throughput by orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Intel", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Intel", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Manos Athanassoulis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Athanassoulis:Manos", "Shimin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shimin", "Anastasia Ailamaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ailamaki:Anastasia", "Phillip B.
