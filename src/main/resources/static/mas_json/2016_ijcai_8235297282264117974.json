Datalog is a very popular formalism, a de-facto standard for expressing and querying knowledge. Diverse results exist regarding the expressivity of Datalog and its extension by input negation (semipositive Datalog) and/or a linear order (orderinvariant Datalog). When classifying the expressivity of logical formalisms by their model-theoretic properties, a very natural and prominent such property is preservation under homomorphisms. This paper solves the remaining open questions needed to arrive at a complete picture regarding the interrelationships between the class of homomorphism-closed queries and the query classes related to the four versions of Datalog. Most notably, we exhibit a query that is both homomorphism-closed and computable in polynomial time but cannot be expressed in order-invariant Datalog.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Sebastian Rudolph.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudolph:Sebastian", "Micha\u00ebl Thomazo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomazo:Micha=euml=l"], "pages": 7}
