{"title": "Selecting skyline services for QoS-based web service composition.", "fields": ["ws i basic profile", "ws policy", "ws addressing", "web modeling", "mobile qos"], "abstract": "Web service composition enables seamless and dynamic integration of business applications on the web. The performance of the composed application is determined by the performance of the involved web services. Therefore, non-functional, quality of service aspects are crucial for selecting the web services to take part in the composition. Identifying the best candidate web services from a set of functionally-equivalent services is a multi-criteria decision making problem. The selected services should optimize the overall QoS of the composed application, while satisfying all the constraints specified by the client on individual QoS parameters. In this paper, we propose an approach based on the notion of skyline to effectively and efficiently select services for composition, reducing the number of candidate services to be considered. We also discuss how a provider can improve its service to become more competitive and increase its potential of being included in composite applications. We evaluate our approach experimentally using both real and synthetically generated datasets.", "citation": "Citations (456)", "departments": ["Leibniz University of Hanover", "Leibniz University of Hanover", "Leibniz University of Hanover"], "authors": ["Mohammad Alrifai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alrifai:Mohammad", "Dimitrios Skoutas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skoutas:Dimitrios", "Thomas Risse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Risse_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
