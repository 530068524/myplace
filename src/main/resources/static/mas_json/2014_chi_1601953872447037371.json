{"title": "Utilising insight journalism for community technology design.", "fields": ["sustainable community", "citizen journalism", "amateur", "technical journalism", "design technology"], "abstract": "We describe the process of  insight journalism , in which local amateur journalists were used to generate unique insights into the digital needs of a community. We position this as a means for communities to represent themselves to designers, both as a method of designing community technologies and as a first step towards supporting innovation at a local level. To demonstrate insight journalism, we present two case studies of community technologies that were directly inspired, informed and evaluated by journalistic content. Based on this experience, we evaluate the role that insight journalism can play in designing for communities, the particular characteristics that it lends to the design process and how it might be employed to support sustainable community innovation.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Dundee", "University of Surrey", "University of Central Lancashire", "University of Dundee", "University Coll ...
