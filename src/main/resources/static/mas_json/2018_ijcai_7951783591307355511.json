We identify structural properties under which a convex optimization problem can be massively parallelized via map-reduce operations using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. The class of problems that can be tackled this way is quite broad and includes experimental design, AdaBoost, and projection to a convex hull. Implementing FW via map-reduce eases parallelization and deployment via commercial distributed computing frameworks. We demonstrate this by implementing FW over Spark, an engine for parallel data processing, and establish that parallelization through map-reduce yields significant performance improvements: we solve problems with 10 million variables using 350 cores in 44 minutes; the same operation takes 133 hours when executed serially.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Armin Moharrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moharrer:Armin", "Stratis Ioannidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ioannidis:Stratis"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 5}
