{"title": "Towards Ontology Learning from Folksonomies.", "fields": ["semantic web stack", "semantic web", "ontology learning", "folksonomy", "social semantic web"], "abstract": "A folksonomy refers to a collection of user-defined tags with which users describe contents published on the Web. With the flourish of Web 2.0, folksonomies have become an important mean to develop the Semantic Web. Because tags in folksonomies are authored freely, there is a need to understand the structure and semantics of these tags in various applications. In this paper, we propose a learning approach to create an ontology that captures the hierarchical semantic structure of folksonomies. Our experimental results on two different genres of real world data sets show that our method can effectively learn the ontology structure from the folksonomies.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Jie", "Ho-fung Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Ho=fung", "Qiong Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0001:Qiong", "Dewei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Dewei", "Jibin Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Jibin"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
