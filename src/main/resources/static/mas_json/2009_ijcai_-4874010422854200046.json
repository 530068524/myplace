Our main result is the identification of two new sources of complexity: the combination of transitive roles and role hierarchies which results in 2-EXPTIME-hardness, and transitive roles alone which result in CO-NEXPTIME-hardness. These bounds complement the existing result that inverse roles make query answering in SHIQ 2-EXPTIME-hard. We also show that conjunctive query answering with transitive roles, but without inverse roles and role hierarchies, remains in EXPTIME if the ABox is tree-shaped.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "University of Bremen", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Thomas Eiter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eiter:Thomas", "Carsten Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Carsten", "Magdalena Ortiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ortiz:Magdalena", "Mantas Simkus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simkus:Mantas"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
