{"title": "Changing flights in mid-air: a model for safely modifying continuous queries.", "fields": ["stream processing", "web query classification", "correctness", "load management", "input output"], "abstract": "Continuous queries can run for unpredictably long periods of time. During their lifetime, these queries may need to be adapted either due to changes in application semantics (e.g., the implementation of a new alert detection policy), or due to changes in the system's behavior (e.g., adapting performance to a changing load). While in previous works query modification has been implicitly utilized to serve specific purposes (e.g., load management), to date no research has been done that defines a general-purpose, reliable, and efficiently implementable model for modifying continuous queries at run-time. In this paper, we introduce a punctuation-based framework that can formally express arbitrary lifecycle operations on the basis of input-output mappings and basic control elements such as start or stop of queries. On top of this foundation, we derive all possible query change methods, each providing different levels of correctness guarantees and performance. We further show how these models can be efficiently realized in a state-of-the-art stream processing engine; we also provide experimental results demonstrating the key performance tradeoffs of the change methods.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Systems Group,  ... ch, Switzerland"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kyumars Sheykh Esmaili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esmaili:Kyumars_Sheykh", "Tahmineh Sanamrad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanamrad:Tahmineh", "Peter M.
