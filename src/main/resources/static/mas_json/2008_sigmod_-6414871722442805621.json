{"title": "DiMaC: a system for cleaning disguised missing data.", "fields": ["data set", "data pre processing", "synthetic data", "imputation", "data quality"], "abstract": "In some applications such as filling in a customer information form on the web, some missing values may not be explicitly represented as such, but instead appear as potentially valid data values. Such missing values are known as  disguised missing data , which may impair the quality of data analysis severely. The very limited previous studies on cleaning disguised missing data highly rely on domain background knowledge in specific applications and may not work well for the cases where the disguise values are inliers.   Recently, we have studied the problem of cleaning disguised missing data systematically, and proposed an effective heuristic approach [2]. In this paper, we describe a demonstration of  DiMaC , a  Di sguised  M issing D a ta  C leaning system which can find the frequently used disguise values in data sets without requiring any domain background knowledge. In this demo, we will show (1) the critical techniques of finding suspicious disguise values; (2) the architecture and user interface of  DiMaC  system; (3) an empirical case study on both real and synthetic data sets, which verifies the effectiveness and the efficiency of the techniques; (4) some challenges arising from real applications and several direction for future work.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ming Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua_0001:Ming", "Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian"], "pages": 4}
