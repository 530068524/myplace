Our proposed framework, namely Cast2Face, is featured by: (i) we restrict the names to assign within the set of character names in the cast; (ii) for each character, by using the corresponding actor's name as a key word, we retrieve from Google image search a group of face images to form the gallery set; and (iii) the probe face tracks in the movie are then identified as one of the actors by robust multi-task joint sparse representation and classification method. The assigned actor name on a face track is then mapped to the character name based on the cast again. In addition to face naming, we further apply the proposed method to spotlights summarization of a particular actor in his/her movies. Empirical evaluations on several feature-length movies demonstrate the satisfying performance of our method.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Singapore Management University", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Mengdi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Mengdi", "Xiaotong Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Xiaotong", "Jialie Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Jialie", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
