{"title": "Leveraging Context-Free Grammar for Efficient Inverted Index Compression.", "fields": ["fold", "inverted index", "queries per second", "thread", "grammar based code"], "abstract": "Large-scale search engines need to answer thousands of queries per second over billions of documents, which is typically done by querying a large inverted index. Many highly optimized integer encoding techniques are applied to compress the inverted index and reduce the query processing time. In this paper, we propose a new grammar-based inverted index compression scheme, which can improve the performance of both index compression and query processing.   Our approach identifies patterns (common subsequences of docIDs) among different posting lists and generates a context-free grammar to succinctly represent the inverted index. To further optimize the compression performance, we carefully redesign the index structure. Experiments show a reduction up to 8.8% in space usage while decompression is up to 14% faster.   We also design an efficient list intersection algorithm which utilizes the proposed grammar-based inverted index. We show that our scheme can be combined with common docID reassignment methods and encoding techniques, and yields about 14% to 27% higher throughput for AND queries by utilizing multiple threads.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Nankai University", "Baidu", "Nankai University", "Baidu", "Baidu"], "authors": ["Zhaohua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhaohua", "Jiancong Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Jiancong", "Haibing Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Haibing", "Jin Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Jin", "Tianlong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Tianlong", "Rebecca J.
