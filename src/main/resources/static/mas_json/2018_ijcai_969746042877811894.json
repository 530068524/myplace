To tackle this problem, we firstly propose a novel tagging scheme that can convert the joint extraction task to a tagging problem. Then, based on our tagging scheme, we study different end-toend models to extract entities and their relations directly, without identifying entities and relations separately. We conduct experiments on a public dataset produced by distant supervision method and the experimental results show that the tagging based methods are better than most of the existing pipelined and joint learning methods. What\u2019s more, the end-to-end model proposed in this paper, achieves the best results on the public dataset.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Shaolei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shaolei", "Yue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yue", "Wanxiang Che.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Che:Wanxiang", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ting"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
