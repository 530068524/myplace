{"title": "Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature: Probabilistic Integration with Theoretical Guarantees.", "fields": ["integrator", "quadrature", "statistical inference", "probabilistic logic", "exponential function"], "abstract": "There is renewed interest in formulating integration as a statistical inference problem, motivated by obtaining a full distribution over numerical error that can be propagated through subsequent computation. Current methods, such as Bayesian Quadrature, demonstrate impressive empirical performance but lack theoretical analysis. An important challenge is therefore to reconcile these probabilistic integrators with rigorous convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present the first probabilistic integrator that admits such theoretical treatment, called Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature (FWBQ). Under FWBQ, convergence to the true value of the integral is shown to be up to exponential and posterior contraction rates are proven to be up to super-exponential. In simulations, FWBQ is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and out-performs alternatives based on Frank-Wolfe optimisation. Our approach is applied to successfully quantify numerical error in the solution to a challenging Bayesian model choice problem in cellular biology.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Warwick", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Briol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Briol:Fran=ccedil=ois=Xavier", "Chris J.
