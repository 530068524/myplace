F. Scott Fizgerald hinted at this kind of inversion when he called his era a generation grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken. Perhaps nowhere in American fiction has this Lost Generation been more vividly preserved than in Fitzgerald s short fiction. Spanning the early twentieth-century American landscape, this original collection captures, with Fitzgerald s signature blend of enchantment and disillusionment, America during the Jazz Age.
