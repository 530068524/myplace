A Dirichlet process prior (DPP) model defined over class distributions ensures that both known and unknown class distributions originate according to a common base distribution. In an attempt to automatically discover potentially interesting class formations, the prior model is coupled with a suitably chosen data model, and sequential Monte Carlo sampling is used to perform online inference. Our research is driven by a biodetection application, where a new class of pathogen may suddenly appear, and the rapid increase in the number of samples originating from this class indicates the onset of an outbreak.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Murat Dundar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dundar:Murat", "Ferit Akova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akova:Ferit", "Alan Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Alan", "Bartek Rajwa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajwa:Bartek"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
