{"title": "Situated Dissemination through an HCI Workplace.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "knowledge management", "situated", "reflexivity", "computer science"], "abstract": "Researchers working in domains such as Research through Design and Feminist HCI have been questioning \"dissemination practices\" and their impact on our capacity to produce reflexive accounts of research in publications. This paper examines academic dissemination practices within HCI research communities from an institutional to individual level. We unpack the practice via a meta-review of recent literature published in CHI and other venues on 'What is HCI?'. We review the core text on this debate and other similar discussions on HCI methodologies and reflexive accounts of research in domains such as 'Research through Design' and 'Feminist HCI'. We highlight the importance of practicing reflexivity through dissemination and introduce 'Research Fictions' in the form of video essays and live performances, produced by the first author with her colleagues, based on their HCI submissions. Through experimenting with alternative dissemination formats, we argue that our exploratory processes engender a practice of reflexivity within a research lab.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Northumbria University", "Twisted Digits, ...
