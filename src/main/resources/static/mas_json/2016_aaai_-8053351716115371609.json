But do they perform as well for constraint optimization problems? We propose an adaptation of counting-based search for optimization, show how to modify solution density computation for some of the most frequently-occurring constraints, and empirically evaluate its performance on several benchmark problems.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Gilles Pesant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pesant:Gilles"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
