{"title": "PCCA: A new approach for distance learning from sparse pairwise constraints.", "fields": ["data point", "training set", "clustering high dimensional data", "pairwise comparison", "metric"], "abstract": "This paper introduces Pairwise Constrained Component Analysis (PCCA), a new algorithm for learning distance metrics from sparse pairwise similarity/dissimilarity constraints in high dimensional input space, problem for which most existing distance metric learning approaches are not adapted. PCCA learns a projection into a low-dimensional space where the distance between pairs of data points respects the desired constraints, exhibiting good generalization properties in presence of high dimensional data. The paper also shows how to efficiently kernelize the approach. PCCA is experimentally validated on two challenging vision tasks, face verification and person re-identification, for which we obtain state-of-the-art results.", "citation": "Citations (484)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Caen Lower Normandy", "University of Caen Lower Normandy"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Alexis Mignon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mignon:Alexis", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jurie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurie:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric"], "pages": 7}
