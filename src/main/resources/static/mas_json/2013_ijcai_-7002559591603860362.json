{"title": "Three Semantics for the Core of the Distributed Ontology Language (Extended Abstract).", "fields": ["upper ontology", "idef5", "process ontology", "ontology components", "ontology based data integration"], "abstract": "The Distributed Ontology Language DOL, currently being standardized as ISO WD 17347 within the OntoIOp (Ontology Integration and Interoperability) activity of ISO/TC 37, provides a unified framework for (1) ontologies formalized in heterogeneous logics, (2) modular ontologies, (3) links between ontologies, and (4) ontology annotation. A DOL ontology consists of modules formalized in languages such as OWL or Common Logic, serialized in the existing syntaxes of these languages. On top, DOL's meta level allows for expressing heterogeneous ontologies and links between ontologies, including (heterogeneous) imports and alignments, conservative extensions, and theory interpretations. We present the abstract syntax of these meta-level constructs, with three alternative semantics: direct, translational, and collapsed semantics.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Birmingham", "University of Bremen"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Till Mossakowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mossakowski:Till", "Christoph Lange.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lange_0002:Christoph", "Oliver Kutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kutz:Oliver"], "pages": 5}
