However, it is challenging to guarantee the correctness of their behaviors due to the complex nature of the autonomous agents, especially when they have stochastic characteristics. In this work, we propose to apply probabilistic model checking to analyze multi-agent systems. A modeling language called PMA is defined to specify such kind of systems, and LTL property and logic of knowledge combined with probabilistic requirements are supported to analyze system behaviors. Initial evaluation indicates the effectiveness of our current progress; meanwhile some challenges and possible solutions are discussed as our ongoing work.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "National University of Singapore", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Songzheng Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Songzheng", "Jianye Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Jianye", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Yang", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Ho-fung Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Ho=fung", "Jin Song Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jin_Song"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
