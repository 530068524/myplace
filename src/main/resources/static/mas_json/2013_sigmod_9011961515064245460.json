{"title": "Hekaton: SQL server's memory-optimized OLTP engine.", "fields": ["stored procedure", "online transaction processing", "database engine", "optimistic concurrency control", "multiversion concurrency control"], "abstract": "Hekaton is a new database engine optimized for memory resident data and OLTP workloads. Hekaton is fully integrated into SQL Server; it is not a separate system. To take advantage of Hekaton, a user simply declares a table memory optimized. Hekaton tables are fully transactional and durable and accessed using T-SQL in the same way as regular SQL Server tables. A query can reference both Hekaton tables and regular tables and a transaction can update data in both types of tables. T-SQL stored procedures that reference only Hekaton tables can be compiled into machine code for further performance improvements. The engine is designed for high con-currency. To achieve this it uses only latch-free data structures and a new optimistic, multiversion concurrency control technique. This paper gives an overview of the design of the Hekaton engine and reports some experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (277)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Cristian Diaconu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diaconu:Cristian", "Craig Freedman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freedman:Craig", "Erik Ismert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ismert:Erik", "Per-\u00c5ke Larson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larson:Per==Aring=ke", "Pravin Mittal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mittal:Pravin", "Ryan Stonecipher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stonecipher:Ryan", "Nitin Verma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verma:Nitin", "Mike Zwilling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwilling:Mike"], "pages": 12}
