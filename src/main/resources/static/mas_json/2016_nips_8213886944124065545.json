These DNNs were subsequently used to probe the neural representations of music. Representational similarity analysis revealed the existence of a representational gradient across the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Anterior STG was shown to be more sensitive to low-level stimulus features encoded in shallow DNN layers whereas posterior STG was shown to be more sensitive to high-level stimulus features encoded in deep DNN layers.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "authors": ["Umut G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=uuml==ccedil=l=uuml=:Umut", "Jordy Thielen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thielen:Jordy", "Michael Hanke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanke:Michael", "Marcel van Gerven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerven:Marcel_van", "Marcel A.
