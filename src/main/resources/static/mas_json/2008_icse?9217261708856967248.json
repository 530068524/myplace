Many SPL implementations support features with coarse granularity - e.g., the ability to add and wrap entire methods. However, fine-grained extensions, like adding a statement in the middle of a method, either require intricate workarounds or obfuscate the base code with annotations. Though many SPLs can and have been implemented with the coarse granularity of existing approaches, fine-grained extensions are essential when extracting features from legacy applications. Furthermore, also some existing SPLs could benefit from fine-grained extensions to reduce code replication or improve readability. In this paper, we analyze the effects of feature granularity in SPLs and present a tool, called  Colored IDE (CIDE) , that allows features to implement coarse-grained and fine-grained extensions in a concise way. In two case studies, we show how CIDE simplifies SPL development compared to traditional approaches.", "citation": "Citations (503)", "departments": ["University of Passau", "University of Passau", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Federal University of Pernambuco", "Federal University of Bahia", "Federal University of Pernambuco", "Sch. of Comput. ... burg, Magdeburg", "Sch. of Comput. ... burg, Magdeburg", "Philipps University Marburg", "Philipps University Marburg"], "authors": ["Christian K\u00e4stner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=auml=stner:Christian", "Sven Apel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apel:Sven", "Martin Kuhlemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhlemann:Martin"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
