Objects and parts of objects in the image are delineated from their surrounding by closed contours which make up their boundary. In this paper we introduce a new bottom-up visual operator to capture the concept of closed contours, which we call the \u2018Torque\u2019 operator. Its computation is inspired by the mechanical definition of torque or moment of force, and applied to image edges. The torque operator takes as input edges and computes over regions of different size a measure of how well the edges are aligned to form a closed, convex contour. We explore fundamental properties of this measure and demonstrate that it can be made a useful tool for visual attention, segmentation, and boundary edge detection by verifying its benefits on these applications.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Morimichi Nishigaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishigaki:Morimichi", "Cornelia Ferm\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferm=uuml=ller:Cornelia", "Daniel DeMenthon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeMenthon:Daniel"], "pages": 8}
