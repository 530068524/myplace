{"title": "PQTable: Fast Exact Asymmetric Distance Neighbor Search for Product Quantization Using Hash Tables.", "fields": ["rolling hash", "perfect hash function", "double hashing", "primary clustering", "hash tree"], "abstract": "We propose the product quantization table (PQTable), a product quantization-based hash table that is fast and requires neither parameter tuning nor training steps. The PQTable produces exactly the same results as a linear PQ search, and is 102 to 105 times faster when tested on the SIFT1B data. In addition, although state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by previous inverted-indexing-based approaches, such methods do require manually designed parameter setting and much training, whereas our method is free from them. Therefore, PQTable offers a practical and useful solution for real-world problems.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yusuke Matsui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsui:Yusuke", "Toshihiko Yamasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamasaki:Toshihiko", "Kiyoharu Aizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aizawa:Kiyoharu"], "pages": 9}
