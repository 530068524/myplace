In this paper, built upon the concept of torque in image space, we propose a new contour-related feature to detect and describe local contour information in images. There are two components for our proposed feature: One is a contour patch detector for detecting image patches with interesting information of object contour, which we call the Maximal/Minimal Torque Patch (MTP) detector. The other is a contour patch descriptor for characterizing a contour patch by sampling the torque values, which we call the Multi-scale Torque (MST) descriptor. Experiments for object recognition on the Caltech-101 dataset showed that the proposed contour feature outperforms other contour-related features and is on a par with many other types of features. When combing our descriptor with the complementary SIFT descriptor, impressive recognition results are observed.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["South China University of Technology", "South China University of Technology", "South China University of Technology", "National University of Singapore", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yong", "Yuhui Quan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quan:Yuhui", "Zhuming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhuming", "Hui Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Hui", "Cornelia Ferm\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferm=uuml=ller:Cornelia", "Morimichi Nishigaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishigaki:Morimichi", "Daniel DeMenthon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeMenthon:Daniel"], "pages": 8}
