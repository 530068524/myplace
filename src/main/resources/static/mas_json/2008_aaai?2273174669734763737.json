Motivated by the Transductive Support Vector Machines (Vapnik 1998), we propose an online framework that naturally addresses these problems in a unified manner. Our empirical study with a synthetic dataset and a road tracking dataset demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "National ICT Au ...
