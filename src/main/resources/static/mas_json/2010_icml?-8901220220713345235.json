The idea of the first method is to use the PL model to fit locally constant probability models in the context of instance-based learning. As opposed to this, the second method estimates a global model in which the PL parameters are represented as functions of the instance. Comparing our methods with previous approaches to label ranking, we find that they offer a number of advantages. Experimentally, we moreover show that they are highly competitive to start-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive accuracy, especially in the case of training data with incomplete ranking information.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of Marburg", "University of Marburg", "Pozna\u0144 University of Technology", "University of Marburg"], "authors": ["Weiwei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Weiwei", "Krzysztof Dembczynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dembczynski:Krzysztof", "Eyke H\u00fcllermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=uuml=llermeier:Eyke"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
