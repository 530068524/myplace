Our approach uses simple closed-form update rules and is provably convergent. Promising empirical results are demonstrated on a variety of high-dimensional datasets.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Princeton University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Irina Rish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rish:Irina", "Genady Grabarnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grabarnik:Genady", "Guillermo A.
