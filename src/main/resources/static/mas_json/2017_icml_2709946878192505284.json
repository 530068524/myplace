We show that the approach of releasing noisy sufficient statistics using the Laplace mechanism achieves a good trade-off between privacy, utility, and practicality. A naive learning algorithm that uses the noisy sufficient statistics \"as is\" outperforms general-purpose differentially private learning algorithms. However, it has three limitations: it ignores knowledge about the data generating process, rests on uncertain theoretical foundations, and exhibits certain pathologies. We develop a more principled approach that applies the formalism of collective graphical models to perform inference over the true sufficient statistics within an expectation-maximization framework. We show that this learns better models than competing approaches on both synthetic data and on real human mobility data used as a case study.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Mount Holyoke College", "Colgate University"], "authors": ["Garrett Bernstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernstein:Garrett", "Ryan McKenna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McKenna:Ryan", "Tao Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Tao", "Daniel Sheldon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheldon:Daniel", "Michael Hay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hay:Michael", "Gerome Miklau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miklau:Gerome"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
