This allows bypassing the infamous \u00e2   \u00e2    barrier for strongly convex regularizers that has stalled progress on a number of algorithmic problems.   Applying area-convex regularization, we present a nearly-linear time approximation algorithm for solving matrix inequality systems  A   X  \u00e2 \ufffd  B  over right-stochastic matrices  X . By combining that algorithm with existing work on preconditioning maximum-flow, we obtain a nearly-linear time approximation algorithm for maximum concurrent flow in undirected graphs: given an undirected, capacitated graph with  m  edges and  k  demand vectors, the algorithm takes \ufffd ( mk N  \u00e2  1 ) time and outputs  k  flows routing the specified demands with total congestion at most (1+N ) times optimal.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jonah Sherman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sherman:Jonah"], "pages": 9}
