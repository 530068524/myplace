{"title": "Features of Disagreement Between Retrieval Effectiveness Measures.", "fields": ["intuition", "data mining", "ir evaluation", "computer science", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Many IR effectiveness measures are motivated from intuition, theory, or user studies. In general, most effectiveness measures are well correlated with each other. But, what about where they don't correlate? Which rankings cause measures to disagree? Are these rankings predictable for particular pairs of measures? In this work, we examine how and where metrics disagree, and identify differences that should be considered when selecting metrics for use in evaluating retrieval systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["RMIT University", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "RMIT University", "RMIT University"], "authors": ["Timothy Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones_0001:Timothy", "Paul Thomas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomas:Paul", "Falk Scholer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholer:Falk", "Mark Sanderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanderson:Mark"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
