Players in this game are divided into two teams in front of a wall-type flat display and try to score points by grounding a fireball on the other team's court like volleyball. The players can recognize their contacts with the fireball from mirrored image of their own appearance and the superimposed fireball in the display. Computer detects those contacts by using a real-time time-of-flight camera and renders flame of the fireball based on fluid simulation. The reason why we choose fire as a ball is that several characteristics of fire are advantages in interactions between users and virtual objects. This game can provide players with enough enjoyment and reality due to these advantages even if the implemented human detection algorithm is quite simple.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Sei Ikeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikeda:Sei", "Yuki Uranishi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uranishi:Yuki", "Yoshitsugu Manabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manabe:Yoshitsugu", "Kunihiro Chihara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chihara:Kunihiro"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
