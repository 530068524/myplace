Our approach exploits shading information to recover the millimeter-scale surface structure, but in contrast to related approaches succeeds under general unconstrained lighting conditions. Our method starts off from a set of multi-view video frames and an initial series of reconstructed coarse 3D meshes that lack any surface detail. In a spatio-temporal maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) inference framework, our approach first estimates the incident illumination and the spatially-varying albedo map on the mesh surface for every time instant. Thereafter, albedo and illumination are used to estimate the true geometric detail visible in the images and add it to the coarse reconstructions. The MAP framework uses weak temporal priors on lighting, albedo and geometry which improve reconstruction quality yet allow for temporal variations in the data.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["MPI Informatik, Germany", "MPI Informatik, Germany", "MPI Informatik, Germany", "MPI Informatik, Germany", "MPI Informatik, Germany"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Chenglei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Chenglei", "Kiran Varanasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varanasi:Kiran", "Yebin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yebin", "Hans-Peter Seidel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidel:Hans=Peter", "Christian Theobalt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobalt:Christian"], "pages": 8}
