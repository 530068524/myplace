In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of the Radio Broadcast Data System (RBDS) associated with FM radio stations as a means to deliver social network content to OSN users who do not have access to Internet services. Using Instagram as a case study, we analyze data from 254 public Instagram users associated with the Tribal Digital Village (TDV) network in Southern California. Our analysis of over 1.2 million unique Instagram posts reveals that Instagram users in the TDV network interact with locally generated content 46.6\ufffd  more often than content generated by users from outside the network. We use our observations of OSN usage to compare five OSN content scheduling approaches. Our evaluation reveals that up to 81% of users received at least half of their content requests and 35.5% of the 1.1 million requested Instagram photos were transmitted to users.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "Southern Califo ... n's Association"], "authors": ["Morgan Vigil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vigil:Morgan", "Elizabeth M.
